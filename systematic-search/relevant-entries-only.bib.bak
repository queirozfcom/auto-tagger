  abstract  = {Equipping an imaginary Random Surfer of the Web with the ability to teleport, was Page et al.'s creative way to justify a mathematical necessity; the Teleportation Matrix. Despite being essential for ensuring the ergodicity of the underlying Markov chain, the standard definition of this matrix treats the nodes of the graph in a simplistic and “leveling” way that can prove counterintuitive - especially for applications of the method on graphs of heterogeneous data. In this work, we focus on such graphs and we propose a novel alternative teleportation model that yields a well-defined ranking vector, while being as easy to handle as the traditional teleportation. We explore the theoretical implications of our model, and we reveal a wealth of nice properties that result to direct computational advantages over PageRank. We conduct a set of experiments using real-world datasets and we verify both the useful computational characteristics of our model and its favorable qualitative performance. Our promising findings suggest there remain more to be explored, and maybe much to be gained, by revisiting the teleportation model; a neglected part of PageRank that is typically taken for granted by the majority of applications in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Bud Burst Mobile is a smart phone application for an environmental Participatory Sensing project that focuses on observing plants and collecting plant life stage data. The app was initially designed for record-keeping and motivation to participate in this project has been based on improving scientific knowledge. To test other methods for motivating data collection and increasing user retention, we added an outdoor game activity, similar to geocaching, called flora caching. Players gain points and levels within the game by finding and making qualitative observations on plants. Location-based information is included in the game with the display of local lists of plant species occurring in a user's area derived from governmental data sources. Additionally, user-collected data and the occurrence of species on the local lists obtained from the photo-sharing website Flickr are displayed on an interactive map. Administrator targeting of individual plants facilitates expert control over crowd-sourced data collection for species of interest. We evaluated these additional features with the help of 50 volunteers playing on the UCLA campus as a case study. Results indicated that participants were highly motivated by the flora caching game, and next-most by the knowledge that environmental scientists will use the data collected for studying the effects of global climate change. Other motivating features included sharing plant observations with other users and the information contained in the local lists of plants.},

Tags have been extensively used to organize and index mashup services. However, people favor manual tags creation in the past. This approach demands user intervention, which is extremely time-consuming and probes to errors. In this paper we propose a novel Mashup-API-Tag model for automatic mashup tag recommendation. The model simultaneously incorporates the composition relationships between mashups and APIs as well as the annotation relationships between APIs and tags to discover the latent topics. Then the semantic similarity between Web APIs and mashups can be acquired. Subsequently, tags of chosen APIs are recommended to a mashup where the mashup and the APIs are most similar. In addition, we develop a tag filtering algorithm to select the most relevant tags for recommendation. The experimental results on a real world dataset prove that our approach outperforms other methods, including frequency-based methods and the methods that only consider the composition relationships and the annotation relationships separately.},

Based on Ames's theoretical framework on motivation, we propose a model for knowledge contribution in problem-solving virtual communities (PSVCs). The model includes two second-order individual motivations, with four major mechanisms in PSVCs that are associated with these motivations. Results confirm that only egoistic motives affect members' knowledge contribution in PSVCs. Further, knowledge repository and social identity are found to be important mechanisms for promoting knowledge contribution through egoistic motives. This paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications and provides insights for future research.},

  abstract = {Given a collection of web images with the corresponding textual descriptions, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain learning method to classify these web multimedia objects by transferring the correlation knowledge among different information sources. Here, the knowledge is extracted from unlabeled objects through unsupervised learning and applied to perform supervised classification tasks. To mine more meaningful correlation knowledge, instead of using commonly used visual words in the traditional bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, we discover higher level visual components (words and phrases) to incorporate the spatial and semantic information into our image representation model, i.e., bag-of-visual-phrases (BoP). By combining the enriched visual components with the textual words, we calculate the frequently co-occurring pairs among them to construct a cross-domain correlated graph in which the correlation knowledge is mined. After that, we investigate two different strategies to apply such knowledge to enrich the feature space where the supervised classification is performed. By transferring such knowledge, our cross-domain transfer learning method can not only handle large scale web multimedia objects, but also deal with the situation that the textual descriptions of a small portion of web images are missing. Empirical experiments on two different datasets of web multimedia objects are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain transfer learning method.},

Searching a hash tag simply shows a list of tweets, each contains the query hash tag string. To find even more relevant hash tags, we propose to use a graph-based approach to find similar hash tags by using the social network graph around hash tags. We start by using a heterogeneous social graph that contains users, tweets, and hash tags, then we summarize the graph to a hash tag graph that shows the similarity between different hash tags. Finally, we rank the vertices in respect to a query hash tag using a random walk with restart and a content similarity measure. The experimental work demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to baselines.},

Moreover, the coupling scheme is also an efficient tool to investigate various aspects of the influence propagation on multiple OSNs. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthesized datasets not only confirm the quality of the solution but also reveal interesting insights into the behavior of influence propagation in and across the networks.},

  abstract  = {In tag-word disambiguation, a word is assigned to a specific context chosen among the different ones to which it is related. Relatedness to a context is often defined based on the co-occurrence of the target word with other words (context words) in sentences of a specific corpus. The overall disambiguation process can be thought as a classification process, where the context words play the role of features for the target. A problem with this approach is that the large number of possible context words can reduce the classification performance, both in terms of computational effort and in terms of quality of the outcome. Feature selection can improve the process in both regards, by reducing the overall feature space to a manageable size with high information content. In this work we propose to use, in disambiguation, a feature selection approach based on the Shapley Value (SV) - a Coalitional Game Theory related metrics, measuring the importance of a component within a coalition. By including in the feature set only the words with the highest Shapley Value, we obtain remarkable quality and performance improvements. The problem of the exponential complexity in the exact SV computation is avoided by an approximate computation based on sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and of the sampling approach results, by using both a synthetic language corpus and a real world linguistic corpus.},

The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.},

  abstract  = {This study addresses the problem of inferring users' employment affiliation information from social activities. It is motivated by the applications which need to monitoring and analyzing the social activities of the employees from a given company, especially their social tracks related to the work and business. It definitely helps to better understand their needs and opinions towards certain business area, so that the account sales targeting these customers in the given company can adjust the sales strategies accordingly. Specifically, in this task we are given a snapshot of a social network and some labeled social users who are the employees of a given company. Our goal is to identify more users from the same company. We formulate this problem as a task of classifying nodes over a graph, and develop a Supervised Label Propagation model. It naturally incorporates the rich set of features for social activities, models the networking effect by label propagation, and learns the feature weights so that the labels are propagated to the right users. To validate its effectiveness, we show our case studies on identifying the employees of "China Telecom" and "China Unicom" from Sina Weibo. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the compared baseline ones.},

Semantic information is needed for many complex tasks like concept extraction and information integration. In order to establish the value of user-generated annotation, this paper presents two experiments on which only user tags are used as input. At the core of semantic extraction is the identification of concepts and relationships that are present in the data. We show, through an experimental study on tagged photographs, how to extract concepts associated with photographs and their relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to extract a concept associated with a photograph with an overall precision score of 80%. Our experiments also show that a variation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient on sets of tags can be used to determine equivalence relationships between the concepts associated with these sets.},

  abstract  = {The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

These tools, termed coordination technologies in this paper, have undergone remarkable changes over time in the functionality that they offer. We contribute a novel perspective on this historical trend with our Coordination Pyramid, a framework that recognizes four distinct paradigms of coordination and classifies coordination technologies according to which paradigm they primarily support. Although historical in its construction, the Pyramid has strong implications for both current practice and future re-search directions. With respect to practice, the Pyramid helps organizations in identifying and articulating future coordination needs, mismatches that exist between these needs and the portfolio of coordination tools presently in use, and solution strategies for addressing these mismatches. With respect to research, the Pyramid clearly highlights several trends in how tools have historically evolved and can be anticipated to evolve in future.},

However, these tags are often imprecise and incomplete, which essentially limits tag-based image indexing and related applications. To tackle this issue, we propose an image retagging scheme that aims at refining the quality of the tags. The retagging process is formulated as a multiple graph-based multi-label learning problem, which simultaneously explores the visual content of the images, semantic correlation of the tags as well as the prior information provided by users. Different from classical single graph-based multi-label learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm propagates the information of each tag along an individual tag-specific similarity graph, which reflects the particular relationship among the images with respect to the specific tag and at the same time the propagations of different tags interact with each other in a collaborative way with an extra tag similarity graph. In particular, we present a robust tag-specific visual sub-vocabulary learning algorithm for the construction of those tag-specific graphs. Experimental results on two benchmark Flickr image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image retagging scheme. We also show the remarkable performance improvements brought by retagging in the task of image ranking.},

  abstract  = {Large graphs and networks are abundant in modern information systems: entity-relationship graphs over relational data or Web-extracted entities, biological networks, social online communities, knowledge bases, and many more. Often such data comes with expressive node and edge labels that allow an interpretation as a semantic graph, and edge weights that reflect the strengths of semantic relations between entities. Finding close relationships between a given set of two, three, or more entities is an important building block for many search, ranking, and analysis tasks. From an algorithmic point of view, this translates into computing the best Steiner trees between the given nodes, a classical NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a new approximation algorithm, coined STAR, for relationship queries over large relationship graphs. We prove that for n query entities, STAR yields an O(log(n))-approximation of the optimal Steiner tree in pseudopolynomial run-time, and show that in practical cases the results returned by STAR are qualitatively comparable to or even better than the results returned by a classical 2-approximation algorithm. We then describe an extension to our algorithm to return the top-k Steiner trees. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm over both main-memory as well as completely diskresident graphs containing millions of nodes. Our experiments show that in terms of efficiency STAR outperforms the best state-of-the-art database methods by a large margin, and also returns qualitatively better results.},

Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.},

The computed weight of a tag indicates the relevance of the tag to a given ad. Then based on the tag weights, we select the ad which is the most relevant to the current video which a user is viewing.Using lab experiments, we show that our tag-based approach is able to select relevant ads. For example, experiments show that 58% of the selected ads are among the top 5 most relevant ads in a pool of 64 candidate ads.},

In this particular study, the year of the published paper and type of research paper publication are combined with similarity ranking called (HybridRank). Different weighting scores are employed. The retrieval performance of these weighted combination rankings are evaluated using mean values of NDCG. The results suggest that HybridRank and similarity rank with weight 75:25 has the highest NDCG scores. From the preliminary result of experiment, the combination ranking technique provide more relevant research paper search results.

  abstract  = {One of the goals of mobile and ubiquitous computing is to enable ad-hoc interactions between different kinds of entities to help end-users perform different kinds of tasks. These entities, which include devices and services, may either be mobile or situated in the surrounding physical environment. However, these interactions require the use of rich semantic models describing the capabilities of the entities, the data exchanged between them and the desires of end-users. These semantic models enable the discovery of entities that satisfy certain constraints as well as the composition of different entities into applications for performing different kinds of tasks. In this paper, we describe two models that we have used in our systems for describing data and entities. The first model is based on OWL ontologies, where all data is described by a set of OWL facts, and component inputs and outputs are described using RDF graph patterns. The second model is based on folksonomies, where all data is described by a set of tags, and component inputs and outputs are also described using sets of tags. The two models have very different properties in terms of expressiveness and ease of use. We present our experiences in using these models for discovery of entities and for the automatic composition of complex flows in response to dynamic end-user goals. We also describe some of the future challenges that lay in the path of semantically-enabled ad-hoc interactions.},

When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.},

  abstract  = {The name ambiguity problem is a challenge in many areas, especially in the field of bibliographic digital libraries. For example, in services that use citation data to compute the impact of authors, ambiguous names lead to biased measures. The problem is amplified where names are collected from heterogeneous sources, including crowd sourced annotations. This is the case in the Scholaro meter system, which cross-correlates author names in user queries with those retrieved from bibliographic data. The uncontrolled nature of user-generated annotations is very valuable, but creates the need to detect ambiguous names. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect ambiguous names at query time, which makes it applicable in the context of a social computing application. We explore two kinds of heuristic features based on citations and crowd sourced topics. Our approach can detect ambiguous author names in crowd sourced scholarly data with an accuracy of 75%.},

Most prior works have explored two learning strategies independently for domain adaptation: feature matching and instance reweighting. In this paper, we show that both strategies are important and inevitable when the domain difference is substantially large. We therefore put forward a novel Transfer Joint Matching (TJM) approach to model them in a unified optimization problem. Specifically, TJM aims to reduce the domain difference by jointly matching the features and reweighting the instances across domains in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is invariant to both the distribution difference and the irrelevant instances. Comprehensive experimental results verify that TJM can significantly outperform competitive methods for cross-domain image recognition problems.},

While any one individual may not provide sufficient samples, aggregating samples across many individuals provides high-quality, high-coverage measurements of the phenomena. Thus, for participatory sensing to be successful, one must motivate a large number of individuals to participate. In this work, we review a variety of incentive mechanisms that motivate people to contribute to a CS effort. We then establish a set of design constraints or minimum requirements that any incentive mechanism for CS must have. These design constrains are then used as metrics to evaluate those approaches and determine their advantages and disadvantages. We also contribute a taxonomy of CS incentive mechanisms and show how current systems fit within this taxonomy. We conclude with the identification of new types of incentive mechanisms that require further investigation.},

This research presents a novel technique for item recommendation within social networks that matches user and group interests over time. Users often tag items in social networks with words and phrases that reflect their preferred "vocabulary." As such, these tags provide succinct descriptions of the resource, implicitly reveal user preferences, and, as the tag vocabulary of users tends to change over time, reflect the dynamics of user preferences. Based on evaluation of user and group interests over time, we present a recommendation system employing a modified latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model in which users and tags associated with an item are represented and clustered by topics, and the topic-based representation is combined with the item's timestamp to show time-based topic distribution. By representing users via topics, the model can cluster users to reveal the group interests. Based on this model, we developed a recommendation system that reflects user as well as group interests in a dynamic manner that accounts for time, allowing it to perform in a manner superior to that of static recommendation systems in terms of precision rate.},

In crowd sourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company's production cost can be greatly reduced. In 2003, Luis von Ahn and his colleagues pioneered the concept of "human computation", which utilizes human abilities to perform computation tasks that are difficult for computers to process. Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis.

However, it can be problematic given the visual variations between anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method for similarity computation in medical imaging. Instead of the low-level visual appearance, we design a CCA-PairLDA feature representation method to capture the similarity between images with high-level semantics. First, we extract the PairLDA topics to represent an image as a mixture of latent semantic topics in an image pair context. Second, we generate a CCA-correlation model to represent the semantic association between an image pair for similarity computation. While PairLDA adjusts the latent topics for all image pairs, CCA-correlation helps to associate an individual image pair. In this way, the semantic descriptions of an image pair are closely correlated, and naturally correspond to similarity computation between images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets for image retrieval and showed improved performance.},

The implications are that we need to focus the design of learning technologies to support social learning in context. Instead of designing technologies that ldquoteachrdquo the learner, the new social learning technologies will perform three main roles: 1) support the learner in finding the right content (right for the context, for the particular learner, for the specific purpose of the learner, right pedagogically); 2) support learners to connect with the right people (again right for the context, learner, purpose, educational goal etc.), and 3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. In the pursuit of such environments, new areas of sciences become relevant as a source of methods and techniques: social psychology, economic/game theory, multi-agent systems. The paper illustrates how social learning technologies can be designed using some existing and emerging technologies: ontologies vs. social tagging, exploratory search, collaborative vs. self-managed social recommendations, trust and reputation mechanisms, mechanism design and social visualization.},

  abstract  = {In many research and business domains, there are efforts to develop systems that aggregate user data gathered by various data sources. This approach involves secondary sharing of user data and potentially benefits the user in terms of improved personalization and better experience. However, concerns regarding privacy arise when sharing user data with unknown third parties. These concerns can be alleviated at two stages: i) ensuring selective control of the applications to share user data with, and ii) monitoring and penalizing errant data consumers who violate the terms of their contractual agreement and potentially abuse user data. This paper addresses the second stage of data use contract enforcement. We propose a trust management mechanism for monitoring data consumers' compliance to the contractual agreements for which data was shared with them. The trust mechanism is based on user complaints about suspected privacy violations and is able to identify the data consumers who are responsible. The framework penalizes the data consumer found guilty of violating its data use agreement by decreasing its trust value. This makes the data consumer less likely to be selected to receive user data, and limits its participation in the user data marketplace, forcing it to pay a higher price for purchase of user data.},

Now it is time to rethink the system, which has grown in an ad-hoc, unstructured way, aiming at the support that will be needed for the next 10 years. In a project jointly funded by Microsoft Research and FAPESP, we aim at the creation of a specification for the new SinBiota 2.0 system, including cutting-edge services and technologies on information technology, in order to achieve a number of goals, namely: guarantee the use and expansion of the system for the next ten years, support the availability of a larger volume of higher quality environmental data, oriented also to the educational and public administration sectors, provide more efficient sharing of data among BIOTA researchers, inter-operate with international initiatives, provide effective tools to assist researchers in finding relevant information amongst a large amount of environment data. The expected results at the end of this project are the composition of a specification (Reference Document) of the SinBiota 2.0 system, and the implementation of a prototype that will gradually replace the current system. We propose in this work the system architecture and our vision of the main features that would allow SinBiota 2.0 to meet the expectations of the biodiversity research community and other stakeholders.

In contrast, editorial annotations from production music libraries are meant to be incisive in nature.

First, a semantic computing technique devised for mood-related tags in large datasets is applied to Last.fm and I Like Music (ILM) corpora separately (250,000 tracks each). The resulting semantic estimates are then correlated with listener ratings of arousal, valence and tension. High correlations (Spearman's rho) are found between the track positions in the dimensional mood spaces and listener ratings using both data sources (0.60 <; rs <; 0.70). In addition, the use of curated editorial data provides a statistically significant improvement compared to crowd-sourced data for predicting moods perceived in music.},

  abstract  = {An important challenge in Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) is architectural knowledge vaporization, i.e., the loss of technical knowledge due to a lack of documentation. In a previous work we identified that technical knowledge is usually available in unstructured textual electronic means (e.g. chat, mail, blogs, etc. - also known as UTEMs) used by AGSD workers during development, although not necessarily easily accessible. Also, we proposed the concept of Knowledge Condensation as a means to recover knowledge from UTEMs, by introducing a structure to their contents along with means to retrieve knowledge. In this work we present our first step towards a Knowledge Condensation tool, through a prototype tagging mechanism to structure architectural knowledge during UTEM interactions. We evaluated the prototype and obtained the following results: (1) a high perception of usefulness and a high projected intention of use, and (2) the identification of 6 tagging behavior profiles from participants. These tagging behaviors can be grouped as (i) participants who tag as expected, (ii) participants who tag more than expected, and (ii) participants who tag less than expected. These results suggest that it is important to cope with "little or no tagging" and "excessive tagging" behaviors to implement knowledge condensation based on UTEM tagging. Furthermore, we identified that tagging could be a good option to structure UTEM interactions, and to retrieve architectural knowledge from UTEM logs. Future work includes improving the tagging mechanism prototype based on the participants' suggestions and overall evaluation results, and implementing a searcher prototype to further evaluate the concept of knowledge condensation based on tagging of UTEM interactions.},

ManiWordle allows people to manipulate typography, color, and composition not only for the layout as a whole, but also for the individual words, enabling them to have better control over the layout result. We first describe our design rationale along with the interaction techniques for tweaking the layout. We then present the results both from the preliminary usability study and from the comparative study between ManiWordle and Wordle. The results suggest that ManiWordle provides higher user satisfaction and an efficient method of creating the desired "art work," harnessing the power behind the ever-increasing popularity of Wordle.},

In this paper, we introduce a new method for automatically creating a new social network, across a popular folksonomy site, where users are clustered according to their domain of interest.

Specifically, we first estimate document similarity by combining words and tags and then adjust the document ranks with the assumption that similar documents should have similar retrieval scores. On similarity estimation, we present a new feature extraction method, called CRMF, from which document similarity can be derived. The CRMF can integrate the content and relation properties of multiple views and mine their correspondence. Besides, it does not require that all the documents to have tags. We tested the proposed approach on collections which are derived from Clue Web and contain Delicious tags. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tags on document re-ranking, where CRMF is significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods using tags.},

Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social book marking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social book marking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data.},

Special attention is given to a variety of innovative geographical platforms that provide users with an intuitive understanding and support the further acquisition of spatial knowledge. The monograph concludes with a discussion of the number of outstanding issues, including the changing nature of maps as the primary spatial interface, concerns about privacy for spatial information, and a look at the future of user-centered spatial information systems.

Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

It is a challenging task because information provided by users on an SNS platform could be false, conflicting, missing and deceptive. One way to gain an accurate profile of a user is to link up all their multiple accounts created on different social platforms, which is referred to as Account Linkage (AL). However, existing AL techniques suffer from the problem of information unreliability. Recent advances in location acquisition and wireless communication technologies give rise to new opportunities for AL. In this paper, we propose a framework that links up multiple accounts belonging to the same individual by comparing habit patterns extracted from user-generated location data. We built a topic model to capture users habit patterns in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Results of experiments carried out on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed framework.},

In this context, cooperating enterprises need a shared understanding of their own processes, those of their partners as well as of emerging inter-organizational process structures. In order to create such a shared understanding, the concept of collaborative modeling can serve as a useful approach. This article introduces a concept for collaborative business process modeling and its implementation in the CoMoMod tool. The tool supports several aspects of collaborative process modeling, such as simultaneous work of spatially distributed modelers on one process model diagram. Furthermore the tool permits synchronously creating a collaborative model with different modeling languages by automatically mapping and converting the different model representations. The proof of concept utilizes Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and Petri Nets. The usage of an integrated chat messaging service supports communication during the process of collaboratively modeling business process.},

We show that this model offers several means to fulfill complex search tasks that are hard to be achieved by other existing services.

  abstract  = {Designing software for collaborative sensemaking environments begins with a set of very challenging requirements. At a high level, the software needs to be flexible enough to support multiple lines of inquiry, contradictory hypotheses, and collaborative tasking by multiple analysts. It should also include support for managing evolving human/machine workflows and analytic products at various levels of strictness and formality, processing partial and ambiguous evidence arriving in streams, and developing explanatory scenarios based on both serendipitous and structured discovery. Eventually, it should support the analytic team as they evaluate multiple alternatives and converge on one or more consensus responses, while preserving the history and underlying reasoning. Finally, it should be delightful and simple to use, not require an inordinate degree of precision and exactness, and be quickly and inexpensively deployable in a variety of rapid-response analytic situations. It has not been possible thus far to create a single software architecture that adequately balances all these goals. However, we can shed useful light on this problem by looking at the experience of semantic wiki architectures: an emerging class of software that blends wikis, databases, social tagging systems, and Semantic Web representations.},

Lots of studies have been conducted on content recommendation using users' common interests. However, little has been done to help users to select friends and share content within their social networks. In this paper, we contribute a recommendation framework AOPUT to recommend both content and friend list for sharing to users leveraging content and social information in SNSs. It consists of two recommendation components: Recder and ShareAider. Recder generates content recommendations by connecting users with common interests. An improved Jaccard similarity is proposed to improve the Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation quality. ShareAider recommends a friend list to users when they want to share content with their friends. CF method and a social-based method are compared and the combination of them are explored to achieve better results. AOPUT is evaluated on a real world social network. The experimental results show that (1) Recder can provide better recommendation quality than the traditional CF method thanks to the improved Jaccard similarity; (2) social-based method performs better than CF since the sharing behavior in SNSs are highly dominated by users' social preferences, and the combination of these two methods performs better than each of them individually.},

  abstract  = {With the expansion of e-commerce, recommender systems are drawing more and more attentions. Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular algorithm used for recommendation, but it performs not very well for sparse data and new users. The emergence of trust-based recommender system has solved the problem of CF in a better way. A system of this kind is commonly constructed based upon social network with trust relations. It contains not only user-item rating relations, but also friendships between users, and the friendships are very meaningful in recommendation. However, the trust values in the networks are all specified by users, which are subjective processes. In this paper, we propose a Top-K recommender system on social tagging network, and design a user-item rating matrix construction method on user browsed or searched information. We use tags, which can be regarded as users and items feature information, to compute the similarity between users or items. Moreover, we propose a Top-K recommender system construction method on the network with trust values computed from users' interest similarity. In our experiments we use the Last fm dataset, and we employ the RMSE and hit-radios benchmarks to evaluate the quality and performance of prediction on single item and Top-K recommendation. We compare our approach with two traditional CF algorithms. The experimental results show that our system has good performance, and it solves the defects of CF and existing Trust-based recommender systems.},

The easy use of tags, along with the ability to publicly share tags and resources from others, has attracted many users to actively participate. However, more and more users are facing the problem of effectively organizing and browsing the increasing tags and resources in one’s personal tag space. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically group tags in one’s personal tag space into tag clusters thus helping the user organize the large tagged resources effectively. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model one’s personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We also propose a visual interface model for tag browsing by incorporating Tag Cloud and clustering technology, where tags in each cluster are organized as a tag-cloud. Experiments on del.icio.us show that the clustering results are very similar to bundles manually created by users. The presented algorithm not only groups the semantic-related tags into clusters, but also generates meaningful descriptions for each cluster automatically. In addition, the prototype system shows that the grouped Tag Cloud visualization interface improves the visual representation of a typical Tag Cloud layout.},

In this paper, we propose a method of identifying users' interest similarity based on clustering Hot Vertices (HotV). A hot vertex in a social network is an account which has a large number of fans. The approach extracts users' common interests by mining and clustering the hot vertices that the two users are following simultaneously. Both the experiment and theoretical analysis have proved that the proposed approach makes a significant improvement on the precision of similarity measuring with a relatively low time and space complexity.},

Software engineers are becoming more nomadic in carrying out their work, working from the customer location, the headquarters of their own company, their home, or sometimes even from their holiday locations. Technological support is needed to overcome the negative impacts of distance that are introduced by this trend. The central theme in this paper for supporting dislocated software engineers lies in increasing their awareness level to a level similar to (or even exceeding) what they experience in a co-located setting. In this paper we present the context in which we are bootstrapping a custom fit environment to support a team of fully dislocated software engineers and the incremental process we use. By working in this fashion we are discovering the requirements to support fully distributed teams while at the same time providing our setting with working solutions to help them with their day to day challenges. Finally, this continuous practical use also provides us with empirical data to validate the increase in awareness levels of dislocated software engineers and helps us in pinpointing important open research challenges.},

  abstract  = {Cloud computing based Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) has become popular. Several data assets have been released in DaaSes across different cloud platforms. Nevertheless, there are no well-defined ways to describe DaaSes and their associated data assets. On the one hand, existing DaaS providers simply use HTML documents to describe their service. This simple way of service description requires user to manually perform service lookup by reading the HTML documents to understand DaaSes as well as their provided data assets. On the other hand, existing service description techniques are not suitable for describing DaaSes because they consider only service information. The lack of well-structured/linked model to describe DaaSes hinders the automatic service lookup for DaaSes and the integration of DaaSes into data composition and analytic tools. In this paper, we propose DEMODS, a Description Model for DaaS, which introduces a general linked model to cover all basic information of a DaaS. Besides the basic DaaS description model, we also introduce an extended model that integrates existing work in describing quality of data, data and service contract, data dependency, and Quality of Service (QoS). We present a mechanism to incorporate DEMODS into both new and existing DaaSes. Finally, a prototype of DEMODS has been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the “noise.” Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with three-mode tensors, in order to capture the three-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multiway analysis, latent correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Moreover, a hybrid scheme is proposed that additionally considers content-based information that is extracted from items. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Last.fm), against both recent tag-aware and traditional (non tag aware) item recommendation algorithms indicates significant improvements in recommendation quality. Moreover, the experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid scheme.},

  abstract = {The personal learning environment (PLE) concept offers a learner-centric view of learning and suggests a shift from knowledge-push to knowledge-pull approach to learning. One concern with a PLE-driven knowledge-pull approach to learning, however, is information overload. Recommender systems can provide an effective mechanism to deal with the information overload problem in PLEs. In this paper, we study different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation techniques on their applicability and effectiveness in PLE settings. We implement 16 different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, memory based as well as model based, and compare them in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. The results of the conducted offline and user evaluations reveal that the quality of user experience does not correlate with high-recommendation accuracy.},

Competition and the need for innovation imply in ever-changing and emerging needs that result in costly effort to redesign such systems. A flexible knowledge management approach should achieve personalization for organizations by adapting to the domain of the organization, meanwhile simplifying the incorporation of future knowledge retrieval needs. We describe such an approach that employs a knowledge management platform at its core, which supports adding and removing multiple folksonomies, constantly enriches them with semantics and provides domain-specific recommendations and semantic search capabilities. This approach to knowledge retrieval has been applied to the domain of homemade explosives and counter-terrorism efforts as part of the HOMER project.

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging systems (CTS) enable Internet users to annotate for resources using custom tags, and the tags reflect the user interest and thus form a user profile. However, the flexibility of tagging brings large number of synonymous and polysemous tags which make the use of these profile information to personalize resource recommendation difficult. We propose to use graph-based clustering to form groups of semantically-related tags in the offline stage. Then in the online stage the tag clusters act as an intermediary between users and resource and are utilized to personalize the query results in CTS. 5-fold cross-validation is performed on two data sets, the results are compared with two other algorithms. Results show that the algorithm proposed demonstrate much better personalization measured by the F-value, whilst the effect is more miraculous in a multi-topic than in a single-topic CTS. This observation suggests that in a multi-topic CTS tag clustering such as proposed in this paper is an important strategy.},

Consequently, manually curated training data sets are still a preferred choice for many image annotation systems. This paper introduces ARTEMIS - a scheme to enhance automatic selection of training images using an instance-weighted mixture modeling framework. An optimization algorithm is derived to learn instance-weights in addition to mixture parameter estimation, essentially adapting to the noise associated with each example. The mechanism of hypothetical local mapping is evoked so that data in diverse mathematical forms or modalities can be cohesively treated as the system maintains tractability in optimization. Finally, training examples are selected from top-ranked images of a likelihood-based image ranking. Experiments indicate that ARTEMIS exhibits higher resilience to noise than several baselines for large training data collection. The performance of ARTEMIS-trained image annotation system is comparable with usage of manually curated data sets.},

In this paper, we investigate whether a correlation emerges across the different activities a user can take part in. For our analysis, we focused on aNobii, a social platform with a world-wide user base of book readers, who post their readings, give ratings, review books, and discuss them with friends and fellow readers. aNobii presents a heterogeneous structure: 1) part social network, with user-to-user interactions; 2) part interest network, with the management of book collections; and 3) part folksonomy, with books that are tagged by the users. We analyzed a complete snapshot of aNobii and we focused on three specific activities a user can perform, namely tagging behavior, tendency to join groups and aptitude to compile a wishlist of the books one is planning to read. For each user, we create a tag-based, a group-based, and a wishlist-based profile. Experimental analysis, which was carried out with information-theory tools like entropy and mutual information, suggests that tag-based and group-based profiles are in general more informative than wishlist-based ones. Furthermore, we discover that the degree of correlation between the three profiles associated with the same user tend to be small. Hence, user profiling cannot be reduced to considering just any one type of user activity (albeit important) but it is crucial to incorporate multiple dimensions to effectively describe users' preferences and behavior.},

In particular, dynamically growing network analyses become important to find long-term trends and detect anomalies. In order to analyze such networks, we need to obtain many snapshots and apply same analytic methods to them. However, it is inefficient to extract communities from these whole newly generated networks with little differences every time, and then it is impossible to follow the network growths in the real time. We proposed an incremental community detection algorithm for high-volume graph streams. It is based on the top of a well-known batch-oriented algorithm named DEMON [1]. We also evaluated performance and precisions of our proposed incremental algorithm with real-world big networks with up to 410,236 vertices and 2,439,437 edges and computed in less than one second to detect communities in an incremental fashion - which achieves up to 107 times faster than the original algorithm without sacrificing accuracies.},

In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand. Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.},

  abstract  = {Traditional collaborative filtering approaches are often confronted with two major problems: data sparsity and cold-start. Fortunately, along with the rise of social media, social network is producing a large and rich set of social data (such as labels, trust, etc.), which provides a new way to solve the problems of collaborative filtering, namely, we can make use of social data to enhance the recommendation accuracy. However, traditional recommendation algorithms may only consider either the influence of similarity relationships or trust relationships to the user model, but fail to take full advantage of the implications of social data. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm called STPMF based on neighborhood model and matrix factorization model, where complementary roles of similarity relationships and trust relationships to the user model by means of a weight w are considered simultaneously. Furthermore, we propagate similarity relationships and trust relationships one step or two steps to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems. We have conducted experiments on two real world data sets from Last.fm and Delicious. Compared with existing recommendation algorithms, our method can effectively alleviate the problems of collaborative filtering, and enhance the recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Social tags are annotations for Web pages collaboratively added by users. It will be much easier to understand the meaning of Web pages and classify them according to their tags. The precision in retrieving Web pages may also increase using such tags. Nowadays social tags are mostly annotated manually by users via social bookmarking Web sites. Such manual annotation process may produce diverse, redundant, and inconsistent tags. Besides, many tags which are inconsistent with their annotated Web pages exist and deteriorate the feasibility of social tags. In this work we will develop an automatic scheme to discover the associations between Web pages and social tags and apply such associations on applications of social tag spam detection. We applied a text mining approach based on self-organizing maps to find the relationships between Web pages and social tags. The disadvantages of manual annotation will be remedied through such relationships. The discovered associations were then used to identify social tag spams. Preliminary experiments show that the quality and usability of social tags were improved through this method.},

The proposed methodology is based on the use of bibliometrics; i.e., analysis is conducted using information regarding trends and patterns of publication. While using bibliometric techniques in this way is not a new idea, the proposed approach extends previous studies in a number of important ways. Firstly, instead of being purely exploratory, the focus of our research has been on developing techniques for detecting technologies that are in the early growth phase, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of relevant publications. Secondly, to increase the reliability of the forecasting effort, we propose the use of automatically generated keyword taxonomies, allowing the growth potentials of subordinate technologies to be aggregated into the overall potential of larger technology categories. A proof-of-concept implementation of each component of the framework is presented, and is used to study the domain of renewable energy technologies. Results from this analysis are presented and discussed.},

We study a solution which mitigates the two approaches, i.e., short and accurate textual descriptions that illustrate the software entities without having to read the details of the implementation. We create such descriptions using techniques from automatic text summarization. The paper presents a study that investigates the suitability of various such techniques for generating source code summaries. The results indicate that a combination of text summarization techniques is most appropriate for source code summarization and that developers generally agree with the summaries produced.},

In this paper we predict the popularity distribution of YouTube videos within a campus network. We explore two broad approaches in predicting the popularity of videos in the network: consensus approaches based on aggregate behavior in the network, and social approaches based on the information diffusion over an implicit network. We measure the performance of our approaches under a simple caching framework by picking the k most popular videos according to our predicted distribution and calculating the hit rate on the cache. We develop our approach by first incorporating video inter-arrival time (based on the power-law distribution governing the transmission time between two receivers of the same message in scale-free networks) to the baseline (LRFU), then combining with an information diffusion model over the inferred latent social graph that governs diffusion of videos in the network. We apply techniques from latent social network inference to learn the sharing probabilities between users in the network and apply a virus propagation model borrowed from mathematical epidemiology to estimate the number of times a video will be accessed in the future. Our approach gives rise to a 14% hit rate improvement over the baseline.},

In order to detect unsupervised communities in social tagging networks, this paper uses similarity cloud properties of cloud model to solve the different community analysis, classification, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities problems. Cloud model is used in this paper. By introducing similarity cloud properties of cloud model, cloud model can detect the unsupervised communities, describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively, and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities. For illustration, the proposed model is applied to Delicious dataset to detect unsupervised communities and one month is used as time slice to study the evolutions of the unsupervised communities. Empirical results show that the unsupervised community in social tagging in network, using Similarity cloud properties of cloud model can effectively detect different unsupervised communities, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively. Similarity cloud properties based cloud model can effectively detect unsupervised community in social tagging network, and quantitatively describe the evolutions of the community and community user' dynamic interest.

The rapid increase number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In this paper, the semantic link network model is used for organizing multimedia resources. A whole model for generating the association relation between multimedia resources using semantic link network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association. The hierarchical semantic of multimedia resources is defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different in the proposed framework. The modules of semantic link network model are implemented to measure association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two evaluation methods, including clustering and retrieval, are performed, which shows the proposed method can measure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.},

The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2. Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy.},

Indeed, most of the systems base the indexing process on few generic text information (e.g., course title and teacher's name) and this creates problems to students who are looking for very specific topics and hence want to browse video in details. Moreover, additional metadata could provide useful information to those users who access the educational materials by means of assistive technologies. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows students to take on-the-fly notes while watching a video lecture and uses these notes to enrich video lectures with metadata that will be helpful to the indexing and retrieval process. In particular, to allow detailed video browsing, our proposed SOcial Learning (SOLE) system defines a set of eight predefined tagnotes and segments the lecture into a sequence of video chapters. Students can use the textual notes to describe and to retrieve the video material, providing hints about its content to users with special needs. To evaluate our approach, we developed a prototype version of SOLE and we asked for volunteer evaluators. Results showed that users feel comfortable in taking notes while watching a video and liked to browse video lectures using notes. According to the results obtained in the evaluation, both students and video lecture providers might appreciate the proposed approach.},

Nevertheless, they neglect the correlations of visual and textual hyperedges, which are more robust to represent the high-order relationship among vertices. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph with correlated hyperedges (CHH), which introduces high-order relationship of hyperedges into hypergraph learning. Based on CHH, a pairwise visual-textual correlation hypergraph (VTCH) model is used for tag-based social image search. To overcome the large number of newly generated hybrid hyperedges, a bagging-based method is adopted to balance the accuracy and speed. Finally, adaptive hyperedges learning method is used to obtain the relevance score for social image search. The experiments conducted on MIR Flickr show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract = {With the explosive growth of services, including Web services, cloud services, APIs and mashups, discovering the appropriate services for consumers is becoming an imperative issue. The traditional service discovery approaches mainly face two challenges: 1) the single source of description documents limits the effectiveness of discovery due to the insufficiency of semantic information; 2) more factors should be considered with the generally increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called SMS, for effectively discovering the appropriate services by incorporating social media information. Specifically, we present different methods to measure four social factors (semantic similarity, popularity, activity, decay factor) collected from Twitter. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model is applied to mine semantic information of services from meta-data of Twitter Lists that contains them. In addition, we assume the target query-service matching function as a linear combination of multiple social factors and design a weight learning algorithm to learn an optimal combination of the measured social factors. Comprehensive experiments based on a real-world dataset crawled from Twitter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework SMS, through some compared approaches.},

Existing service discovery approaches merely focus on WSDL-based keyword search, semantic matching based on domain knowledge or ontologies, or QoS-based recommendations. The keyword search omits the underlying correlations and semantic knowledge or QoS information is not always available. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic service discovery approach to help web service users to retrieve related services and to improve the search performance. Specifically, we apply a probabilistic model to characterize the latten topics between services and queries, and then propose a matching method based on the topic relevance. Experiments on services from a real service repository confirm the feasibility and efficiency of this proposed method.},

Therefore, recruiting sufficient number of well-suited workers is always a challenge. Existing methods usually recruit workers through open calls, friendships relations, matching their profiles with task requirements or recruiting teams of workers. But there are still challenges that need more investigations, mainly all existing recruitment methods are highly vulnerable to collaborating misbehaviour, i.e., Collusion. %These groups are highly vulnerable to collusion attacks. In this paper, we propose a recruitment method which takes into account individual and social attributes of workers to find suitable workers. The method discovers indirect collaborations between workers to harness implicit teamwork knowledge in order to increase the quality of crowd sourcing tasks' outcome and in the same time prevent collusion attacks. The proposed method is implemented and tested using the simulated data, build based on a public data dump from Stack overflow. The evaluation results show the accuracy of the obtained results and superiority of our proposed method over the other related work.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies.},

Most people agree that now the new challenge is to explore the potential of that immense information and service deposit already collected, ever-increasing, and easy-to-access to promote a socially-aware recommendation and to foster a more efficient delivery of mobile services. The article addresses the above issues, still unexplored in literature, by focusing on integration problems and describing a practical design experience derived from the development of a socio-technical aware support for the management of mobile services based on the widely diffused and interoperable IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) session control platform. Our proposal is organized along three main original technical guidelines: an innovative support to monitor and describe via social, physical, and computation information the sociotechnical context where services and user interact; a recommendation system to automate and facilitate dynamic selection of the mobile services most suitable from both final user and operator perspectives; and a new IMS-based management platform to ease the composition of existing IMS mobile services and the monitoring and control of their usage at runtime. We believe that we contribute with a first step to the understanding of how full awareness of socio and technical information allows improving overall Quality of Experience (QoE) for the final users.},

To enable content based video retrieval, high quality textual metadata have to be provided that describe the content. Keyword-based search in general is particularly applicable if the searcher really knows what she is looking for and how to find it, i.e. to know the appropriate keywords to obtain the desired results But in many cases either the objectives of the searcher are intrinsically fuzzy or she has no idea of the appropriate keywords. Complex search tasks often cannot be answered by retrieving a single document, but require subsequent searches that build on one another. Moreover, if the user tries to achieve an overview of actually available information about a certain topic, today's web search engines are flooding search results by millions. Thus, giving the user no chance to review but the first few resulting pages. Traditional keyword-based search does not consider the meaning (semantics) of the content of the underlying information and result ranking is mainly based on link popularity.},

Given a large database of electronic music, if a system can classify songs into their respective sub-genres, it can greatly help producers and DJs while making mixes. We describe an approach to classify four major sub-genres of EDM using artificial neural networks. We extracted several rhythmic and statistical features from a database of 400 songs, evenly distributed among the four sub-genres, and used these features to train a Back Propagation Network (BPN) and a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). In addition to classification, we also employed the RELIEFF feature selection algorithm to reduce the number of features and improve our results. Comparing the performances of the two networks on the basis of their correct classifications, we observed that BPN combined with the features proposed yielded a better result of 94.16%.},

Therefore, it is desirable that related blogs can be connected. Clustering is often used for establishing connections between blogs. Full-text keywords retrieval process (FKRP) is generally used to obtain the keywords of posts, and the keywords were then used to cluster posts. Another approach is to use tags or categories chosen by bloggers for their posts. However, the overhead of FKRP is relatively high and the use of tagging is associated with synonymy related issues. More recently, there is an emerging concept called social tagging, which is about having web resources tagged by the general public together. Similar to this concept, we developed a blog connect platform that collects queried keywords used by the people for searching for a post. With the queried keywords, formal concept analysis (FCA) associated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is used to cluster posts. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is better than those of other studies.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, tagging methods have been widely used on the Web for multimedia search and recommendation systems. Social tags are the keywords annotated by users to the multimedia objects. These tags contain the information which allows multimedia objects to be located and classified. Unfortunately, irrelevant information and noise are frequently included in such tags, especially when we use social tagging systems. Imperfect as they may be, social tags are still a significant source of human-generated contextual knowledge. We present the Waking And Sleeping (WAS) algorithm to overcome the obstacle of noisy tags. WAS refines social tags of each image and assigns each tag into either the waking state or the sleeping state. With WAS, the recommendation system not only enhances the accuracy of the recommendation results based on tags with higher quality but also reduces the consumption of computational resources. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to compared methods.},

In this paper we propose a recommendation algorithm, called Fas Tag, that links the relevance of the tags to both their popularity and the opinions of the user's neighbors. Fas Tag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of Fas Tag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, Fas Tag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags. The experiments we did on several datasets show a significant improvement of the accuracy of the recommendations.},

In the case of Software Engineering (SE), students must apply knowledge at the level of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Management of Software Projects. There is a large number of supportive resources for SE that one can find on the web, however, information overload ends up saturating the students who wish to find resources more accurate depending on their needs. This is why we propose a crowdsourcing recommender engine as part of an educational software platform. This engine based its recommendations on content from StackExchange posts using the project's profile in which a student is currently working. To generate the project's profile, our engine takes advantage of the information stored by students in the aforementioned platform. Content-based algorithms based on Okapi BM25 and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used to provide suitable recommendations. The evaluation of the engine was held with students from the capstone course in SE of the University Catholic of Chile. Results show that Cosine similarity over traditional bag-of-words TF-IDF content vectors yield interesting results, but they are outperformed by the integration of BM25 with LDA.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have essentially become an integral part of our daily lives. There are hundreds of OSNs, each with its own focus and offers for particular services and functionalities. To take advantage of the full range of services and functionalities that OSNs offer, users often create several accounts on various OSNs using the same or different personal information. Retrieving all available data about an individual from several OSNs and merging it into one profile can be useful for many purposes. In this paper, we present a method for solving the Entity Resolution (ER), problem for matching user profiles across multiple OSNs. Our algorithm is able to match two user profiles from two different OSNs based on machine learning techniques, which uses features extracted from each one of the user profiles. Using supervised learning techniques and extracted features, we constructed different classifiers, which were then trained and used to rank the probability that two user profiles from two different OSNs belong to the same individual. These classifiers utilized 27 features of mainly three types: name based features (i.e., the Soundex value of two names), general user info based features (i.e., the cosine similarity between two user profiles), and social network topological based features (i.e., the number of mutual friends between two users' friends list). This experimental study uses real-life data collected from two popular OSNs, Facebook and Xing. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and its classification performance measured by AUC was 0.982 in identifying user profiles across two OSNs.},

  abstract = {Social tags serve as a textual source of simple but useful semantic metadata that reflect user preferences or describe web objects and have been widely used in many applications. However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e. non-IIDness), which means that existing text analysis methods such as LDA are not directly applicable. In this article, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation that models tag generation based on both users and objects and, thus, accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as a user-topic distribution matrix and an object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets showed that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely-used point-wise mutual information (PMI) metric. In addition, we analyze the learned topics and show that our model recovers more themes from social tags, while LDA may lead to vanishing topic problems. We also demonstrate our model's advantages in social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristics of the social tagging process.},

Traditional visual search methods use combinations of the confidence scores of individual concept detectors to tackle such queries. In this paper we introduce the notion of bi-concepts, a new concept-based retrieval method that is directly learned from social-tagged images. As the number of potential bi-concepts is gigantic, manually collecting training examples is infeasible. Instead, we propose a multimedia framework to collect de-noised positive as well as informative negative training examples from the social web, to learn bi-concept detectors from these examples, and to apply them in a search engine for retrieving bi-concepts in unlabeled images. We study the behavior of our bi-concept search engine using 1.2 M social-tagged images as a data source. Our experiments indicate that harvesting examples for bi-concepts differs from traditional single-concept methods, yet the examples can be collected with high accuracy using a multi-modal approach. We find that directly learning bi-concepts is better than oracle linear fusion of single-concept detectors, with a relative improvement of 100%. This study reveals the potential of learning high-order semantics from social images, for free, suggesting promising new lines of research.},

Considering different service requirements, this paper firstly proposes multiple information retrieve modes as Fuzzy Constraint Keywords based Searching Mode, Location-based E-Map Browsing Mode, 3-D Tag-Cloud based Collaborative Sharing Mode, which can enable the user to choose suitable retrieve mode and find the useful entity information much quickly. Furthermore, this paper introduces the latest Web2.0 application technologies into our mobile information retrieve system which can provide users with dynamic recommendation information based on the collaborative value-added data. In the end of this paper, it also describes a case study of a mobile location-based restaurant retrieve system. The successful applications of this system in China certificate the efficiency of our ideas.},

Semantic annotation of the provided information is necessary to support the user in retrieving and filtering requested information. Wide-spread tools like Google have shown both the power and the limitations of statistical methods based on correlations between terms within texts. The KEA system uses a different approach. Natural language processing techniques, taking advantage of characteristic linguistic structures defined by the language used in mathematical texts, are utilized in the automatic extraction of ontologies from mathematical texts. As a result, the system creates a base of the mathematical relations and concepts by mapping the extracted ontologies on the structure of a data base. To support the retrieval and further refinement of the data stored within this mathematical knowledge base, KEA implements a number of Web 2.0 technologies in a desktop style interface. The following article presents the technology and applications of the KEA system.},

In this paper, we propose a different approach and we present ViMood, a novel mechanism designed to improve the indexing of video material by integrating objective and subjective emotions. ViMood indexes every video scene with emotion(s) obtained through a combination of low-level feature analysis and on-the-fly viewer's emotion annotation. The goal is to allow viewers to browse video material using either general information (e.g., title, director) or specific emotions (e.g., “joy”, “sadness”, “surprise”). Results obtained in the evaluation process showed that participants were very interested in the hybrid approach, as it fixes some of the problems of the objective and subjective approaches.},

  abstract  = {Social bookmarking or tagging Web sites, or folk-sonomies, emerge recently since the result of traditional context-driven search of Web pages could be improved by user-annotated tags. People could retrieve, organize, and comprehend Web pages thorough such tags. However, spam tags were significantly increased and deteriorated the effectiveness of social tagging. Tags unrelated to the content of the annotated Web pages were added intentionally to improperly manipulate the ranking or retrieval result for malicious purposes. Therefore approaches for filtering and identifying spams in various granularity were proposed to conquer such deficiency. Traditional approaches most focused on user-level detection which tries to differentiate spammers from normal annotators. Such approaches may suffer from the fact that misclassification of spammers as well as spam tags often happens since the intention and behavior of spammers change dynamically. It will be better if we can detect spams in much precise ways such as individual posts or tags. In this work we propose a scheme to identify individual tag spams according to the semantic relatedness between a tag and its annotated page. We first cluster Web pages and tags separately to reveal the relationships among pages and tags, respectively. A relationship discovery process was then applied to find the relationships between a page cluster and a tag cluster. We also devised a measurement to measure the semantic relatedness between individual tag and page. Individual spam tags were then identified according to such relatedness. We conducted experiments on ECML/PKDD RSDC 2008 dataset and obtained promising result.},

The methodology uses frequency information in combination with the International Patent Classification (IPC) to capture semantic information on word categorization, doing so in a way that heretofore has not been employed for topic detection and trend tracking. Term Frequency and Proportional Document Frequency (TF*PDF) is employed as a means to detect hot topics from patents, and IPCs are used to calculate semantic importance of terms based on the IPCs where terms are distributed. Aging Theory is also used to calculate the variation of trends over time. Four types of trends including very stable trends, stable trends, normal trends, and unstable trends are defined and evaluated based on TF*PDF and TF*PDF combined with Aging Theory. Experiment results show that for very stable trends, the combination of TF*PDF and Aging Theory achieves 0.976% in Precision; for stable trends and all trends, TF*PDF achieves 0.959% and 0.84% in Precision, respectively. By applying TF*PDF in consideration of semantic information, we also show a new criteria for weighting hot topics and technology trend tracking.},

In parallel, the research field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has developed taxonomies to classify systems that support collaboration. However, the CSCW perspective presents a bias towards traditional user interface paradigms, whose affordances are quite distinct from those of 3DVW, which include features such as the spatial environment, embodiment, and their dynamics. These are features which are regarded as significant factors in the research field of Presence, and yet, in our opinion, are not well appreciated from the perspective of CSCW analysis. Because of this, we question of the ability of CSCW taxonomies to properly describe the collaboration characteristics of 3DVW. By “properly”, we mean to say that 3DVW bring to fore collaboration characteristics that are in fact distinctive of them as collaboration tools, impacting collaboration in ways that are seldom found in usual groupware, and yet CSCW taxonomies do not distinguish them. We posit that these features should be contemplated in CSCW taxonomies and their usefulness taken into account in the development of future systems that aim to support collaboration.},

  abstract = {The blending of the emerging technology of social networking with unified communications has the potential to radically change how enterprise employees communicate. Enterprise social networking applications help employees build organizational collective wisdom and work more effectively by discovering implied relationships through shared social data. Unified communications applications provide suites of real time and non-real time communication enablers like click-to-call, click-to-IM, presence, and voice mail. Blending these two technologies permits text/audio/video conversations to be treated as social objects whose data and metadata can be stored, searched, tagged, and followed in social networking applications, just like other social objects such as people. In turn, exposing social data about conversations enables innovative new capabilities like recommending conversations for someone to participate in based on inferred interests, or finding and contacting an expert based on knowledge about conversations in the social network. This paper describes People & Projects, an experimental application used in Alcatel-Lucent to investigate advances in enterprise social networking. It also outlines early work on the integration of social networking and unified communications.},

The naive approach to perform filtering early at the publisher edge works only if complete knowledge of the subscriptions is available, which is not compatible with the well-established covering optimization in scalable content-based publish/subscribe systems. We propose an efficient rank-cover technique to reconcile top-k subscription filtering with covering. We extend the covering model to support top-k and describe a novel algorithm for forwarding subscriptions to publishers while maintaining correctness. Finally, we compare our solutions to a baseline covering system. In a typical setting, our optimized solution is scalable and provides over 81% of the covering benefit.},

For instance, to incentivize contributions, file-sharing systems based on the BitTorrent protocol equate value with volume of contributed content and use a prioritization mechanism to reward users who contribute more. This approach and similar techniques used in resource-sharing systems rely on the fact that the physical resources shared among users are easily quantifiable. In contrast, information-sharing systems, like social tagging systems, lack the notion of a physical resource unit (e.g., content size, bandwidth) that facilitates the task of evaluating user contributions. For this reason, the issue of estimating the value of user contributions in information sharing systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces this problem and takes the first steps towards a solution. More precisely, it presents a framework to design algorithms that estimate the value of user contributions in tagging systems, proposes three complementary success criteria for potential solutions, and outlines the methodological evaluation challenges.},

On basis of these, authority users in each topic are selected, and the most frequently used tags by these authority users are recommended to common users, in order to improve the quality of user tagging.},

This paper presents an approach to augment corpus-based ontology learning by considering terms from collaborative tagging systems, social networking platforms, and micro-blogging services. The proposed framework collects information on the domain's terminology from domain documents and a seed ontology in a triple store. Data from social sources such as Delicious, Flickr, Technorati and Twitter provide an outside view of the domain and help incorporate external knowledge into the ontology learning process. The neural network technique of spreading activation is used to identify relevant new concepts, and to determine their positions in the extended ontology. Evaluating the method with two measures (PMI and expert judgements) demonstrates the significant benefits of social evidence sources for ontology learning.},

  abstract  = {Social networks have become the main media for information dissemination in the so-called Web 2.0. The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.},

In this regard, management challenges among multiple online social networks must be revealed to provide insights of strategic thinking for organizations. This study shows that current research of multiple online social networks are shifting from Homogeneous OSNs to Heterogeneous OSNs and Social Internetworking Scenarios (SISs) and producing data interoperability, data privacy and security issues among these virtual organizations.

  abstract  = {While many Web 2.0-inspired approaches to semantic content authoring do acknowledge motivation and incentives as the main drivers of user involvement, the amount of useful human contributions actually available will always remain a scarce resource. Complementarily, there are aspects of semantic content authoring in which automatic techniques have proven to perform reliably, and the added value of human (and collective) intelligence is often a question of cost and timing. The challenge that this book attempts to tackle is how these two approaches (machine- and human-driven computation) could be combined in order to improve the cost-performance ratio of creating, managing, and meaningfully using semantic content. To do so, we need to first understand how theories and practices from social sciences and economics about user behavior and incentives could be applied to semantic content authoring. We will introduce a methodology to help software designers to embed incentives-minded functiona ities into semantic applications, as well as best practices and guidelines. We will present several examples of such applications, addressing tasks such as ontology management, media annotation, and information extraction, which have been built with these considerations in mind. These examples illustrate key design issues of incentivized Semantic Web applications that might have a significant effect on the success and sustainable development of the applications: the suitability of the task and knowledge domain to the intended audience, and the mechanisms set up to ensure high-quality contributions, and extensive user involvement.

  abstract = {Recently, in online social networks (OSNs), the least cost influence (LCI) problem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at identifying a minimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide cascade of information propagation. Most of existing literature investigated the LCI problem only based on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs such that information could be spread across different networks simultaneously. Therefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to consider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances. In this article, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the influence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI problem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and lossy coupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all properties of original networks to achieve high-quality solutions, while the lossy coupling scheme offers an attractive alternative when the running time and memory consumption are of primary concern. Various experiments conducted on both real and synthesized datasets have validated the effectiveness of the coupling schemes, which also provide some interesting insights into the process of influence propagation in multiplex networks.},

With the explosive growth of online texts such as online reviews and user-generated content, the text is becoming more sparse and much bigger, which poses significant challenges on both effectiveness and efficiency issues of text clustering. In our prior work, we presented a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm, which can avoid the zero-feature dilemma of highly sparse texts. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based approximate approach for scaling SAIL algorithm to deal with the large-scale of texts. Particularly, an instance-level random sampling is invoked to reduce the number of instances to be examined during each iteration, which substantially speeds up the clustering on big text data. Furthermore, we prove that the margin of errors introduced by random sampling can be controlled in a small range. Extensive experiments on eight real-life text datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed sampling-based approximate clustering method. In particular, our method shows merits in both effectiveness and efficiency on clustering performance.},

This makes it more challenging to find articles of interest for researchers. Consequently, a solution to this problem, scientific article recommendation, has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel article recommendation method called Citation-based scientific Article Recommendation (CAR). CAR combines the information of researchers' historical preferences and citation relations between articles. We take into account the fact that, not all pairwise articles with citation relations are highly relevant although researchers generally find articles of interest by searching citations. Therefore, in our proposed method, weak citation relations are first filtered out through an association mining technique using data on researchers' historical preferences. Then, these filtered citation relations are incorporated into a graph-based article ranking method for enhancing recommendation quality. Through a relevant real-world dataset, we evaluate our proposed method. Our experimental results verify that the proposed method significantly outperforms other existing baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

Up to recently, the main paradigm to open up archives by automatic tools for audiovisual analysis has been a concept-based indexing and retrieval oriented approach. However, this approach has its limitations, in that it does not scale well, it requires strong supervision, and does not really match well to the user's needs. In this paper, we discuss some upcoming alternative approaches that try to overcome or circumvent some of these issues. This includes i) the use of knowledge modeling to bridge the semantic gap; ii) on-the-fly learning of new, user-defined concepts; and iii) weakly supervised methods that learn from associated text data.

In conventional text classification problems, it is assumed that the feature vectors extracted from the available documents are sufficient to learn good classifiers. However, this conventional approach is not likely to work for Twitter due to the limited number of characters on each tweet. From a higher level, each tweet can be viewed as an abbreviated abstraction of a long document, and we only have a partial observation of this document. To solve the problem caused by the partial observations, we introduce a novel domain adaption/transfer learning approach called Assisted Learning for Partial Observation (ALPOS). The basic idea is to use a large number of multi-labeled examples (source domain) to improve the learning on the partial observations (target domain). In particular, we learn a hidden, higher-level abstraction space, which is meaningful for the multi-labeled examples in the source domain. This is done by simultaneously minimizing the document reconstruction error and the error in a classification model learned in the hidden space by using known labels from the source domain. The partial observations in the target space are then mapped to the same hidden space for recovery and classification. We compare the performance of this method with existing approaches on synthetic data and the well-known Reuters-21578 dataset. We also present experimental results on twitter classification.},

"Big Data" is on the covers of Science, Nature, the Economist, and Wired magazines, on the front pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. But despite the media hyperbole, as Christine Borgman points out in this examination of data and scholarly research, having the right data is usually better than having more data; little data can be just as valuable as big data. In many cases, there are no data -- because relevant data don't exist, cannot be found, or are not available. Moreover, data sharing is difficult, incentives to do so are minimal, and data practices vary widely across disciplines.

Borgman, an often-cited authority on scholarly communication, argues that data have no value or meaning in isolation; they exist within a knowledge infrastructure -- an ecology of people, practices, technologies, institutions, material objects, and relationships. After laying out the premises of her investigation -- six "provocations" mea t to inspire discussion about the uses of data in scholarship -- Borgman offers case studies of data practices in the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, and then considers the implications of her findings for scholarly practice and research policy. To manage and exploit data over the long term, Borgman argues, requires massive investment in knowledge infrastructures; at stake is the future of scholarship.

  abstract = {Tagging music signals with semantic labels such as genres, moods and instruments is important for content-based music retrieval and recommendation. While considerable effort has been made, automatic music annotation is still considered challenging due to the difficulty of extracting good audio features that capture the characteristics of different tags. To address this issue, we present in this letter two exemplar-based approaches that represent the content of a music clip by referring to a large set of unlabeled audio exemplars. The first approach represents a music clip by the set of audio exemplars that is highly correlated with the short-time feature vectors of the clip, whereas the second approach represents a music clip as sparse linear combinations of its short-time feature vectors over the audio exemplars. Music annotation is then performed by learning the relevance of the audio examples to different tags using labeled data. These two approaches effectively capitalize the availability of unlabeled data to explore the commonality of music signals to find out tag-specific acoustic patterns, without domain knowledge and feature design. Evaluation on the CAL10k music genre tagging dataset for tag-based music retrieval shows that, with thousands of unlabeled audio examples randomly drawn from the Million Song Dataset, the proposed approaches lead to remarkably higher precision rates than existing approaches.},

  abstract  = {Detecting intent in Web search activity is important task for finding relevant Web information. However extracting intents from users' queries is difficult as users express their intent by issuing short and often ambiguous queries, yet at the same time it is crucial factor for enhancing user satisfaction. Showing the variety of candidate intents behind a query could help users choose correct intent expressions and improve the Web search. In this paper, we propose the methodology for detecting intent of Web queries using Community Question-Answer (CQA)information. Our assumption is that questions and its answers in CQA corpus reflect intents of questioners. To detect these intents, we use the semantic connections between questions and its answers. We categorize questions to find the connections of features within a question and its answers, detect intent words in answers by calculating supports of concerned CQA contents, and cluster questions and their answers by these intent words. Experimental results show that the variety of Web query intents can be found with satisfactory performance.},

During the two time periods, subjects were asked to collect and tag academic papers. They were requested to fill in their diaries after assigning tags to the papers. Subjects were also interviewed to gain more insights. The outcome from both diaries and interviews were then triangulated, where the themes related to the factors emerged. Themes that emerged include documents usage, document attributes, social ties, opinion expression and organizing strategies. Results showed that the tags assigned by the subjects were influenced by all the factors. The influence from documents usage, document attributes and organizing strategies tended to play a more dominant role than social ties and opinion expression. Also, there did not seem to be any change in the levels of influence between the two time periods. Implications of our findings are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Tagging recommender systems allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy. While the personalization algorithmis successful in both cases.},

Yet, limited number of studies have examined the impact of collaborative information search process on novice's query behaviors. Studying and analyzing factors that influence web search behaviors, specifically users' patterns of queries when using collaborative search systems can help with making query suggestions for group users. Improvements in user query behaviors and system query suggestions help in reducing search time and increasing query success rates for novices. In this paper, we present an empirical study plan designed to investigate the influence of collaboration between experts and novices as well as use of a collaborative web search tool on novice's query behavior. In this research-in-progress study, we intend to use SearchTeam as our collaborative search tool. The results of this study are expected to provide information that could help collaborative web search tool designers to find ways to improve the query suggestions feature for group users. Additionally, this study will test the hypothesis that - having domain experts working with non-experts using collaborative search systems would immensely increase the query success rates for non-expert users, and help them learn querying strategies over the course of time. If the above hypothesis is proven, then use of collaborative web search tools during training of interns would be highly recommended.},

Due to the diversities of users’ interests, different users may tag the same image with different tags. Therefore, tags not only reveal some important image semantic clues, but also show user’s preference, which can provide a new effective solution for overcoming the semantic gap as well as realizing a personalized recommendation. In this paper, a personalized social image recommendation method based on User-Image-Tag model is proposed. The main contributions of our work are that: (1) to efficiently make use of tags, social image tags are re-ranked according to the image content; (2) to obtain user preference, a User-Image-Tag model is constructed with tripartite graph according to the correlation among users, images and Topranking tags; (3) a personalized social recommendation system is implemented based on User-Image-Tag model. Experimental results proved our method can significantly improve the accuracy of personalized image recommendation.},

  abstract  = {Evaluation is important to assess the performance of a computer system in fulfilling a certain user need. In the context of recommendation, researchers usually evaluate the performance of a recommender system by holding out a random subset of observed ratings and calculating the accuracy of the system in reproducing such ratings. This evaluation strategy, however, does not consider the fact that in a real-world setting we are actually given the observed ratings of the past and have to predict for the future. There might be new songs, which create the cold-start problem, and the users' musical preference might change over time. Moreover, the user satisfaction of a recommender system may be related to factors other than accuracy. In light of these observations, we propose in this paper a novel evaluation framework that uses various time-based data splitting methods and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of recommender systems. Using millions of listening records collected from a commercial music streaming service, we compare the performance of collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) models with low-level audio features and semantic audio descriptors. Our evaluation shows that the CB model with semantic descriptors obtains a better trade-off among accuracy, novelty, diversity, freshness and popularity, and can nicely deal with the cold-start problems of new songs.},

In most previous cross-domain recommendation settings, explicit or implicit relationships can be easily established across different domains. However, many real applications belong to a more challenging setting: recommendation across heterogeneous domains without explicit relationships, where neither explicit user-item relations nor overlapping features exist between different domains. In this new setting, we need to (1) enrich the sparse data to characterize users or items and (2) bridge the gap caused by the heterogenous features in different domains. To overcome the first challenge, we proposed an optimized local tag propagation algorithm to generate descriptive tags for user profiling. For the second challenge, we proposed a semantic relatedness metric by mapping the heterogenous features onto their concept space derived from online encyclopedias. We conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets to justify the effectiveness of our solution.},

Hence, the ratings in a recommender system should have different recommended weights. Ratings in fields where in the user has high or low familiarity should be given high or low recommended weights, respectively. However, current recommendation algorithms ignore this problem and use the ratings indiscriminately, thus affecting the accuracy of the recommendation system. In this paper, we provide a focused study of user-familiarity degree-aware recommendation and develop a user-familiarity degree-aware latent factor model for recommendations that considers both user familiarity and item features reflected by the tagging information. We also design a user-familiarity degree-aware probability matrix factorization model, which computes the degree of familiarity of a user with the items he/she has rated. By using the user-familiarity degree, different recommended weights are given to every rating to obtain precise recommendations. The experiment results on real-world datasets show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models and effectively improves the accuracy of the recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {The enormous success and diffusion that online social networks (OSNs) are encountering nowadays is vastly apparent. Users' social interactions now occur using online social media as communication channels; personal information and activities are easily exchanged both for recreational and business purposes in order to obtain social or economic advantages. In this scenario, OSNs are considered critical applications with respect to the security of users and their resources, for their characteristics alone: the large amount of personal information they manage, big economic upturn connected to their commercial use, strict interconnection among users and resources characterizing them, as well as user attitude to easily share private data and activities with strangers. In this book, we discuss three main research topics connected to security in online social networks: (i) trust management, because trust can be intended as a measure of the perception of security (in terms of risks/benefits) hat users in an OSN have with respect to other (unknown/little-known) parties; (ii) controlled information sharing, because in OSNs, where personal information is not only connected to user profiles, but spans across users' social activities and interactions, users must be provided with the possibility to directly control information flows; and (iii) identity management, because OSNs are subjected more and more to malicious attacks that, with respect to traditional ones, have the advantage of being more effective by leveraging the social network as a new medium for reaching victims. For each of these research topics, in this book we provide both theoretical concepts as well as an overview of the main solutions that commercial/non-commercial actors have proposed over the years. We also discuss some of the most promising research directions in these fields.},

  abstract = {Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, Web links, products, etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) method and the kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.},

Messages received by a user mainly depend on whom the user follows. Thus, recommending users with similar interests may improve the experience quality for information receiving. Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts. The experimental results of friend recommendations on Sina Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging sites in China, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

The large-scale user-generated metadata not only facilitate users in sharing and organizing multimedia content, but provide useful information to improve media retrieval and management. Personalized search serves as one of such examples where the web search experience is improved by generating the returned list according to the modified user search intents. In this paper, we exploit the social annotations and propose a novel framework simultaneously considering the user and query relevance to learn to personalized image search. The basic premise is to embed the user preference and query-related search intent into user-specific topic spaces. Since the users' original annotation is too sparse for topic modeling, we need to enrich users' annotation pool before user-specific topic spaces construction. The proposed framework contains two components: (1) a ranking-based multicorrelation tensor factorization model is proposed to perform annotation prediction, which is considered as users' potential annotations for the images; (2) we introduce user-specific topic modeling to map the query relevance and user preference into the same user-specific topic space. For performance evaluation, two resources involved with users' social activities are employed. Experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Online social networks have become popular for communication among people. Previous works on social networks were focused mainly on a single network due to the lack of links from one network to the others. There are several ways to connect different social networks. One possible solution is to find out the same individual who owns accounts for different social networks simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on the problem of linking the same users across different social networks. We start from a basic solution based on profile comparison, which is then improved by considering additional social relationships, i.e., friends. Finally, we propose a two-phase clustering method to generate a social summary for each individual. The first phase is to select strongly-connected groups as seeds. The second phase is to assign non-seeds to the clusters based on the social structure and profiles. The final distributions over various clusters are regarded as the social summary. The experiments have been conducted on two real social networking datasets. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed (social summary) method, compared to the methods of profile comparison and person-name comparison.},

In this paper, we propose a personalized recommendation model based on social tags. We build a user interest model for products by reflecting user interest and product features directly through social tags, and optimize the interest model by social tags clustering. We design a personalized recommendation algorithm based on this model in order to find out the high user interest degree products, which can provide personalized recommendation service for users. The experiment results show that the personalized recommendation model based on social tags can effectively improve the accuracy of product recommendation.},

We are now adding to CSCW-SD a module, called MODUS-SD, capable of modeling users.

We describe a prototype that leverages the Wikipedia category structure to allow a user to semantically navigate pages from the Delicious social bookmarking service. In our system a user can perform an ordinary keyword search and browse relevant pages but is also given the ability to broaden the search to more general topics and narrow it to more specific topics.

  abstract  = {Due to the fact that senior people possess special abilities such as knowledge, experience, and skills which young people do not have, they can be a driving force in the promotion of society. In order to leverage their extensive abilities, it is necessary to collect and organize them effectively. However, fundamental knowledge about seniors in the workplace is still lacking, in particular the types of workstyle preferred by this demographic and their opinions about an ICT-based workstyle are unknown. In addition, an effective method to estimate seniors' skills and knowledge in order to match them to appropriate jobs needs to be developed. In this study, we aim to clarify the work demands of seniors and then propose a method of analyzing their skills in order to match them to work profiles. First, a questionnaire survey was conducted with Japanese seniors. The results indicated that most of the participating seniors valued maintaining their health, achieving a feeling of accomplishment, getting to know one another, contributing to society, and personal growth, as strongly or moderately important to their work. The consciousness of an ICT-based work style was significantly higher in the participants who regarded personal growth and contribution to their colleagues as strongly important. Finally, we propose the concept of skill matching by means of similarity evaluations based on TF-IDF (term frequency - inverted document frequency) calculations in documents pertaining to worker information and work profiles. The results show that this method can be applicable to matching single senior workers with work profiles.},

However, it is practically not easy to find users' interests based on such folksonomies. In this paper, we provide a novel approach for clustering user-centric interests by analyzing tagging practices of individual users. To do this, we collect Really Simple Syndication data from blogosphere, find conceptual clusters using formal concept analysis, and then evaluate the significance of these clusters. The results of the empirical evaluation show that we can effectively recommend different collections of tags to an individual or a set of users.},

Under such circumstances, identifying the same user among different OSNs offers tremendous opportunities for many applications, such as user identification, migration patterns, influence estimation, and expert finding in social media. Different from existing solutions which employ user profile or social network structure alone, in this paper, we proposed a novel joint solution named MapMe, which takes both user profile and social network structure feature into account, so that it can adapt more OSNs with more accurate results. MapMe first calculates user similarity via profile features with the Doc2vec method. Then, it evaluates user similarity by analyzing user’s ego network features. Finally, the profile features and ego network features were combined to measure the similarity of the users. Consequently, MapMe balances the two similarity factors to achieve goals in different platforms and scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted on the synthetic and real data sets, proving that MapMe outperforms the existing methods with 10% on average.},

  abstract  = {In a social context, the user is more and more an active contributor for producing social information. Then, he needs a tailored information reflecting his current needs and interests in every period of time. This aims to provide a better adaptation while accessing the information space by integrating users' interests dynamic. Indeed, users' interests may change and become “outdated” through time. So, an interest judged as relevant in a period of time may fluctuate in the next period of time. Moreover, analysing the classic user behaviour to deduce his current interests is a difficult task. In fact, his behaviour isn't always reflecting his real interests. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enriching the user profile in an evolutionary environment such as a social network. The enrichment takes into account: i) the social behaviour and more precisely the tagging behaviour (that reflects user's interests) and ii) the temporal information (that reflects the dynamic evolution of users' interests). Our approach focus on the concept of temperature that reflects the importance of a resource in each period of time. This concept is used to infer common interests of users tagging the same “important” resource. The originality of our approach relies on combining information tags, users and resources in a way that guarantees a better enrichment for the social user profile. Our approach has been tested and evaluated with the Delicious social database and shows interesting precision values.},

We show that increasing the number of credible or trustworthy agents and agents with a neutral point of view decreases the time taken to reach consensus, whereas the duration is longest when agents with opposing views are in equal proportion.

In this paper, our motive is to develop a recommender system that is based on user assigned tags and content present on web pages. Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation.},

In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of the two techniques, and present an approach for user profiling and neighborhood formation using multidimensional data, and also propose a novel collaborative filtering recommendation model which integrates the tensor factorization based and the neighborhood based collaborative filtering techniques for item recommendation with the Social Tagging Systems (STS) as the application domain. Meanwhile, the proposed recommendation approach is applicable to other application domains where multidimensional data is available. We empirically compare the proposed model against some state-of-the-art collaborative filtering recommendation approaches on two real-world datasets: Bibsonomy and MovieLens.

  abstract  = {With the rapid growth of open APIs on the Internet, searching appropriate APIs for a given query becomes a challenging problem. General API search systems, such as ProgrammableWeb, usually can not provide satisfactory results of API search due to the simple keywords matching between queries and API information offered by providers (e.g. name and description). In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing based search approach named CrowdAPS to effectively find the appropriate APIs. Specifically, CrowdAPS leverages Twitter lists, which is a tool used by individual users to organize accounts that interest them on semantics. List meta-data, including list name and description, is generated from collective intelligence and can be used by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model to acquire semantic similarity between APIs and queries. Furthermore, CrowdAPS exploits list number to infer the popularity of APIs. The final search result relies on the integration of semantic similarity and popularity. Comprehensive experiment based on real-world datasets crawled from ProgrammableWeb and Twitter demonstrates the effectiveness of CrowdAPS.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, developers can be involved in several software developer communities like StackOverflow and Github. Meanwhile, accounts from different communities are usually less connected. Linking these accounts, which is called identity linkage, is a prerequisite of many interesting studies such as investigating activities of one developer in two or more communities. Many researches have been performed on social networks, but very few of them can be adapted to software communities, as information of users provided in these communities has a huge difference to that in social networks. We tackle with the problem by introducing TBIL, a novel tagging-based approach to identity linkage among software communities. The essential idea of this approach is to employ skills (measured by tags), usernames and concerned topics of developers as hints, and to use a decision tree-based algorithm and another heuristic greedy matching algorithm to link user identities. We measure the effectiveness of TBIL on two well-known software communities, i.e., StackOverflow and Github. The results show that our method is feasible and practical in linking developer identities. In particular, the F-Score of our method is 0.15 higher than previous identity linkage methods in software communities.},

Measuring succession can help understand factors that affect the success of such transfers and suggest ways to make them more efficient.

Using ten instances of offshoring succession identified through interviews, we find that the best succession measure can accurately pinpoint the most likely mentors. We model the productivity ratio of more than 1000 developer pairs involved in the succession to test conjectures formulated using the organizational socialization theory and find the ratio to decrease for instances of offshoring and for mentors who have worked primarily on a single project or have transferred ownership for their non-primary project code, thus supporting a theory-based conjectures and providing practical suggestions on how to improve succession.},

  abstract  = {Event-based social networks (EBSNs), such as Meetup and Plancast, which offer platforms for users to plan, arrange, and publish events, have gained increasing popularity and rapid growth. EBSNs capture not only the online social relationship, but also the offline interactions from offline events. They contain rich heterogeneous information, including multiple types of entities, such as users, events, groups and tags, and their interaction relations. Three recommendation tasks, namely recommending groups to users, recommending tags to groups, and recommending events to users, have been explored in three separate studies. However, none of the proposed methods can handle all the three recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a general graph-based model, called HeteRS, to solve the three recommendation problems on EBSNs in one framework. Our method models the rich information with a heterogeneous graph and considers the recommendation problem as a query-dependent node proximity problem. To address the challenging issue of weighting the influences between different types of entities, we propose a learning scheme to set the influence weights between different types of entities. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all the three recommendation tasks, and the learned influence weights help understanding user behaviors.},

The link-structure method assumed a referential definition of expertise, in which experts were users who tagged resources that were frequently tagged by other experts; the semantic-structure method assumed a representational definition of expertise, in which experts were users who had better knowledge of a particular domain and were better at assigning distinctive tags associated with certain domain-specific resources. Simulations results showed that the two methods of expert identification, although based on different assumptions, were in general consistent but did show significant differences. As expected, the link-structure method was better at facilitating exploration of popular “hot” topics than the semantic-structure method. However, the semantic-structure method was better at guiding users to find less popular “cold” topics than the link-structure method. Resources tagged by domain experts could contain cold topics that were associated with high quality tags, but these resources were less likely highlighted by the link-structure method. We argue that to facilitate knowledge exploration in social tagging systems, it is important to keep a good balance between helping user to follow hot topics and to discover cold topics by including expertise rankings generated by both link and semantic structures.},

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems have emerged as a prominent solution to speed up CDS. In this kind of distributed system, a particular interesting challenge refers to mechanisms employed to match user's interests and published contents. The efficacy of CDS depends on the expertise of publishers to properly describe contents, which comprises an important task to guarantee good quality of experience (QoE) to users. Massive attacks may harm CDS if countermeasure mechanisms are not considered to fight content pollution. The main objective of the thesis is to devise a mechanism to provide users a good QoE and reduce the effect of malicious interference. To achieve that, three main steps guided the research work presented in the thesis and summarized in this paper: (i) we proposed a novel strategy that operates conservatively to avoid wide pollution dissemination, (ii) we extended our previous solution to cope with the subjectivity regarding content descriptions, and last, (iii) we proposed a generic model to investigate massive attacks (including content pollution) and conservative approaches.},

Then, knowledge gap is defined both graphically and intuitively with the knowledge map. To bridge the knowledge gap, we design a graph-based method to explore some suitable knowledge paths, which can help a researcher to learn the requisite knowledge in accordance with cognition pattern. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Games with a purpose seem to have large potential for solving further problems, but they also face several design issues involving mainly the validation of human-created artifacts they provide. In this paper we analyze these issues and propose directions for overcoming them for the semantics acquisition domain.

  abstract = {Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in music information retrieval (MIR). It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former.},

In literature we can find three different clustering validity techniques: external criteria, internal criteria and relative criteria. In this paper, we focus on external criteria and present an algorithm that allows the implementation of external measures to assess clustering quality when the structure of the data set is unknown. To obtain an automatic partition of a data set and to reflect how documents must be grouped according to human intuition we use internal information present in data like descriptions provide by the users as tags and the distance between documents. The results show an evident correlation between manual and automatic classes indicating it is acceptable to use an automatic partition. In addition to presenting an alternative to finding the structure of the data set using meta-data such as tags, we also wanted to test the impact of their integration in the k-means++ algorithm and verify how it influences the quality of the formed clusters, suggesting a model of integration based on the occurrence of tags in document content. The experimental results indicate a positive impact when external measures are calculated, although there was no apparent correlation between the weight assigned to the tags and the quality of the obtained clusters.},

Besides illustrating the main characteristics of the QSN and its architecture, we describe its prototype implementation, carried out in the framework of the QUATRO Plus EU project, and its application to a use case scenario, involving groups of teenagers from three different European countries, acting as Youth Panels of the Safer Internet EU Programme.},

The projects were then undertaken to provide systems and services that support various of these primitives, with a view to developing a research infrastructure constructed from these components, which may be regarded as a 'production line' for humanities research, supporting research activities from the creation of primary sources in digital form through to the publication of research outputs for discussion and re-use.},

The tremendous growth of users require the recommender system to produce tag recommendations for millions of users and items at any minute. The triplets of users, items and tags are most naturally described by a 3D tensor, and tensor decomposition-based algorithms can produce high quality recommendations. However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, Para Fac, and Low-order tensor decompositions. We show that these algorithm can very efficiently compute the needed decompositions. We evaluate the fold-in algorithms experimentally on several datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.},

The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

However, there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve users' or groups of users' satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users' behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve users' experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a user's needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection.},

Firstly, we detect events from the photos textual annotations as well as visual features (e.g., timestamp, location); and then effectively identify events by considering the spreading effect of events in the spatio-temporal space. Secondly, we use these relationships among events (e.g., event spatial, temporal and content) for enhancing the precision of the algorithm. Finally, we rank events by analyzing relationships between them (e.g., locations, timestamps, tags) at different period of time. The experiments are conducted with two different approaches: (i) using a collected dataset (offline approach), and (ii) using a realtime dataset (online approach).},

In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective. A novel classifier-free video annotation framework is proposed by first retrieving visual duplicates and then suggesting representative tags. The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},

  abstract  = {World Wide Web provides a huge collection of learning resources. However, as traditional retrieval algorithms lack the use of semantics to retrieve relevant documents, voluminous information is retrieved most of which may be irrelevant to the posted query. Due to which the learning process of a learner is slowed down. Hence, a need is felt to develop a retrieval and ranking method that produces semantically relevant web resources with information need. For this reason, the paper proposes semantically relevant retrieval and ranking of web resources that uses top N resource links returned from a search engine as seed, domain ontologies to compute semantic relevance, and data from Social Bookmarking System (SBS) to retrieve additional semantically relevant resources. Finally all retrieved resources are ranked according to the query relevancy using Vector Space Model (VSM). The proposed approach presented in this paper is elucidated in three parts: (i) a method that expands a posted query using semantic relevance by using ontologies, (ii) an algorithm to retrieve semantically relevant web resources by simulating human cognition using SBS, and (iii) a new approach to compute social semantic ranking of retrieved web resources. Thus it utilizes collective advantages of Social Bookmark Tagging System and Semantic technologies. Improvement in results obtained by the proposed approach in contrast to the existing results retrieved by search engine is apparent from empirical evaluation.},

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task multi-feature metric learning method which models the information sharing mechanism among different learning tasks. We decompose the real world multi-class problems such as semantic categorization or automatic tagging into a set of tasks where each task corresponds to several classes with strong visual correlation. We conduct metric learning to learn a set of (hyper)category-specific metrics for all the tasks. By encouraging model sharing among tasks, more generalization power is acquired. Another advantage is the capability of simultaneous learning with semantic information and social tagging based on the multi-task learning framework, and thus they both benefit from the information provided by each other. Experiments demonstrate the advantages on applications including semantic categorization and automatic tagging compared with other popular metric learning approaches.},

Although there is plenty of work in literature dealing with ranking entities or RDF query results, none of them seem to specifically address the problem of computing predicate rank. We address the problem by associating to each DBpedia property (also known as predicates or attributes of RDF triples) 8 original features specifically designed to provide sort-by-importance quantitative measures, automatically computable from an online SPARQL endpoint or a RDF dataset. By computing those features on a number of entity properties, we created a learning set and tested the performance of a number of well-known learning-to-rank algorithms. Our first experimental results show that the approach is effective and fast. Further, we provide an extensive survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for RDF ranking, to which we compare our approach.},

The layers are created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, i.e., direct and object-based ones which, respectively, correspond to either social or semantic links between individuals. For better understanding of the complexity of the social network structure, layers and their profiles were identified and studied on two, spanned in time, snapshots of the `Flickr' population. Additionally, for each layer, a separate strength measure was proposed. The experiments on the `Flickr' photo sharing system revealed that the relationships between users result either from semantic links between objects they operate on or from social connections of these users. Moreover, the density of the social network increases in time. The second part of this paper is devoted to building a social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations between users in a multimedia sharing system. Its main goal is to generate personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users' needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer in the MSN. The conducted experiments confirmed the usefulness of the proposed model.},

There is, however, a wide agreement that traditional KM and TEL models have failed to cope with the fast-paced change and critical challenges of the new knowledge era. In this paper, we propose a vision for future KM/TEL approaches which aims to fulfill the needs of the new knowledge landscape by introducing the Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory as a new learning theory characterized by the convergence of KM and TEL within a learner-centric knowledge environment. We further discuss a possible implementation of the LaaN theory based on the personal learning environment (PLE) concept.},

  abstract  = {Social network analysis has emerged as an important research area in intelligence analysis to facilitate decision-maker in more informed decisions. With the passage of time social network services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal investigations including understanding and tracking of dark networks, i.e., illegal and covert networks. Criminal organizations are well-suited to be studied using social network analysis as they consist of networks of individuals that span countries and continents using false identities over different networks to remain anonymous. There is a need to recognize the criminals carrying different fake identities to correctly track their immoral activities. This research article is focusing on devising a method which can be used to identify group of people i.e. criminal, terrorist or friends on different Social networks by analyzing patterns and performing correlations across different social network systems. Data integration using cross correlation is used to merge entities to form single fused networks. This single fused network also estimate the intensity of relationship between individuals in general networks based on the number of networks they are connected. To best of our knowledge no such studies is done in the social network analysis, therefore this method is unique and offers innovations in making effective use of presence of people in different networks.},

However, its tag-based photo retrieval function is severely hampered by the inherent nature of folksonomies. As the first step moving towards the alleviation of the problem, this paper, therefore, investigates characterizations of folksonomies on Flickr through its all-time most popular tags. In particular, the study focuses on tag clusters, related tags, and tag categorizations of the all-time most popular tags and compares them with concepts formally defined in ontologies from the Semantic Web. The experimental results imply the feasibilit of employing the Semantic Web technology in searching Flickr photos.},

Besides information sharing, there is a growing need to create a framework to enable collaborative, cross-disciplinary research, which can facilitate a research community into a default mode of collaboration, including: i) enabling scientific researchers to dynamically interact with others, collaboratively author, annotate, review, comment on others' data, and discuss their research; ii) providing a dynamic collaboration environment by harnessing collective contributions from a group of researchers; and iii) facilitating broader participation of people into research projects. While traditional data management and integration systems put much focus on passively integrating existing data, the collaboration among data providers and users is quite limited. In this paper, we present a Web-based collaborative platform to dynamically integrate information for scientific research. Besides data integration, the system provides essential collaboration capabilities to boost user participation and collaboration. The system will not only enable users as active information contributors to bring significant new values to the data, but also provide an environment for scientific researchers to do collaborative research in a large research community.},

Currently, many commercial recommender systems are developed for recommending frequently purchased products where a large amount of explicit ratings or purchase history data is available to predict user preferences. However, for products that are infrequently purchased by users, it is difficult to collect such data and, thus, user profiling becomes a major challenge for recommending these kinds of products. This paper proposes a recommendation approach for infrequently purchased products based on user opinions and navigation data. User opinion data, which is collected from product review data, is used to generate product profiles and user navigation data is used to generate user profiles, both of which are used for recommending products that best satisfy the users' needs. Experiments conducted on real e-commerce data show that the proposed approach, named, Adaptive Collaborative Filtering (ACF), which utilizes user and product profiles, outperforms the Query Expansion (QE) approach that only utilizes product profiles to recommend products. The ACF also performs better than the Basic Search (BS) approach, which is widely applied by the current e-commerce applications.},

Although these methods provide systematic steps for the implementation of m-learning strategies, the correlation between factors cannot be considered thoroughly through the steps, and it is generally necessary to depend on analyzers' capability and experience to select strategic factors and the results of judgment. Hence, there are methodological limits. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process methods were used to analyze 89 valid questionnaires in this case study. The evaluation indexes of the successful factors of m-learning were employed to transfer the opinions of each interviewed learner. The relative weight of each evaluation index was calculated, and the entire weight system of the indexes was established, which was then used as the strategic tool for m-learning development.},

Mashup developers might often struggle to locate the relevant and appropriate services to satisfy their dynamic and personalized requirements. This paper proposes the concept of iSocialMash, a framework that assists the rapid, on-demand and intuitive composition of service mashups, by leveraging social networks. There two key observations guiding the development of iSocialMash. On the one hand, social networks can capture both common interests and personal preferences of different users in the same or similar application contexts; they might use similar candidate services and glue them together in similar manner. On the other hand, social networks can identify potential value-added composition of mashups; different users might have complementary collaboration opportunities for newly emergent goals. iSocialMash exploits the successful experiences of social networks to provide users with useful composition recommendations (such as missing or potentially proper services as well as connections between them). Capturing such composition knowledge, the users are presented by a set of ranked recommendations from which they can choose for their personalized needs. In iSocialMash, the data model leverages the social tagging to enrich the semantics and simplify the presentation and extraction of composition knowledge. We model the composition knowledge into some mashup patterns to accommodate different social networks interactions, and generate on-the-fly recommendations according to user personal requirements. We also experimentally evaluate the efficiency of our approach and present the current status of the prototype.},

Since schemata enable operations like navigation and search, dynamic reconfigurability requires clever indexing strategies, resistant to changes in these schemata. For this purpose, we have used conventional inverted indexing approaches and have also devised a hierarchical clustering-based indexing model. By using Clavy, a system for managing learning object repositories in the field of the Humanities, we provide some experimental results that show how the hierarchical clustering-based model can outperform the more conventional inverted index-based solutions.},

  abstract  = {Defending against spam in tagging system is a very challenging task. This paper presents ReSpam, a novel reputation based mechanism of defending against tag spam in tagging systems. In ReSpam, timing behaviors and voting methods are introduced to defend tag spam. Each user has a global reputation which can increase or decrease after some judgement given bythe tagging system. When the system finds that the time between logging and posting is too short or the time between opening a webpage and posting a tag is too short, the reputations of all the users who post a tag of that kind will decrease. For a uncertain tag, the system requests some users to help to judge the quality of that uncertain tag. If the feedback shows that lots of users regard that tag as spam, all the users who post a tag of that kind will find their reputations lower than before. Otherwise, those users' reputations will increase. The advantage of ReSpam is its simple rationale and less computing compared to pairwise reputation based mechanism such as SpamClean and DSpam. The system ranks search result by the average reputation of annotators of each result. Experimental results show ReSpam can effectively resist tag spam and work better than some existing tag search schemes.},

Annotating documents rises as an interesting strategy to diminish the hard task of retrieving important documents from the Web. Annotations consist of associating metadata with text segments of a document, in order to facilitate its retrieval by search engines. Besides improving their performance, annotations enable an optimized indexation of documents. However, due to the huge amount of existing documents, the idea of generating document annotations is not a trivial task. This paper presents a proposal for automatically enriching documents with semantic annotations, where document terms are annotated according to a domain ontology. Currently there already exist some document annotation tools to automate this process. However, the main contribution of this work is focused on the ability of exploring the ontology inference capability and on the meta-annotation concept, which aim at providing users and automatic agents with a more powerful mechanism to retrieve information.},

Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques augments the capabilities of the platform without additional costs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition in MCS deployed over a fog computing platform which facilitates important operations like user recruitment and task completion. Proper data acquisition minimizes the monetary expenditure the platform sustains to recruit and compensate users and the energy they spend to sense and deliver data. We propose a new user recruitment policy called DSE (Distance, Sociability, Energy). The policy exploits three criteria: i) spatial distance between users and tasks, ii) user sociability, which is an estimate of the willingness of users to contribute to sensing tasks, and iii) remaining battery charge the devices. Performance evaluation is conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants with new metrics that assess the efficiency of the recruitment policy and the accuracy of task completion. Results reveal that the average number of recruited users improves by nearly 20% if compared to policies using only spatial distance as selection criterion.},

  abstract  = {In collaborative software development projects, tasks are often used as a mechanism to coordinate and track shared development work. Modern development environments provide explicit support for task management where tasks are typically organized and managed through predefined categories. Although there have been many studies that analyze data available from task management systems, there has been relatively little work on the design of task management tools. In this paper we explore how tagging with freely assigned keywords provides developers with a lightweight mechanism to further categorize and annotate development tasks. We investigate how tags that are frequently used over a long period of time reveal the need for additional predefined categories of keywords in task management tool support. Finally, we suggest future work to explore how integrated lightweight tool features in a development environment may improve software development practices.},

  abstract = {Today's cloud data centers contain more than millions of servers and offer high bandwidth. A fundamental problem is how to significantly improve the large-scale system's scalability to interconnect a large number of servers and meanwhile support various online services in cloud computing. One way is to deal with the challenge of potential mismatching between the network architecture and the data placement. To address this challenge, we present ANTELOPE, a scalable distributed data-centric scheme in cloud data centers, in which we systematically take into account both the property of network architecture and the optimization of data placement. The basic idea behind ANTELOPE is to leverage precomputation based data cube to support online cloud services. Since the construction of data cube suffers from the high costs of full materialization, we use a semantic-aware partial materialization solution to significantly reduce the operation and space overheads. Extensive experiments on real system implementations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

We select a limited number of popular music tags to form the tag space and design an interface for users to input queries by operating the scroll bars. To effect MTML content-based music retrieval, we introduce a tag-based music aspect model that jointly models the auditory features and tag-based text features of a song. Two indexing methods and their corresponding matching methods, namely pseudo song-based matching and tag co-occurrence pattern-based matching, are incorporated into the pre-learned tag-based music aspect model. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system on the Major Miner dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of using MTML queries to retrieve music from an untagged music database.},

However, many real-world domains are currently left out of the social tagging phenomenon due to the lack of a wide-scale tagging-savvy audience - domains like the personal desktop, enterprise intranets, and digital libraries. Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement.},

  abstract  = {The last few years has seen the use of mobile technology become ubiquituos. Many millions of citizens around the world own smartphones, which they use for both personal and business applications. The majority of smartphones are designed towards Location-based Services (LBS). Consequently these smartphones have on-board GPS devices with the ability of locating the user to an accuracy of a few meters. While at the begining of the growth in popularity of smartphones and LBS technologies most users simply consumed services: where is the nearest coffee shop or subway station? Today, citizens are generating spatial data and information at ever increasing volumes. Examples include: georeferenced photographic collections, location-based social networking such as FourSquare, and volunteered geographic information (VGI). VGI is an exciting movement whereby citizens collect spatial data and information about (their own or another) locality. This content is then shared in collaborative projects such as OpenStreetMap, Geonames, Google Maps Mashups, or WikiMapia. This paper explores the risks involved in using this user-generated spatial data and information with specific emphasis on OpenStreetMap. Most citizens are not specialists in geographic surveying or cartography. Our paper provides results of a large case-study of high edit geographical features. We show that user generated spatial data is a very dynamic but has many inconsistencies.},

In order to address this concern, human-centered business rule engines are proposed, which integrate data mining support and provide intelligent user interfaces to collaborating users.

The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

A within-subject experiment was conducted with 77 subjects. Each took part in both work and non-work information tasks by interacting with six navigation aids. The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues. Understanding how users interact with various way finding cues can enlighten design considerations for refining social navigation functions.

Three social factors, the influence and the activity of the target user, together with the coherence between users, are fused to improve the performance of proposed recommendation strategy. Experimental results show that, compared to the well-known PageRank-based algorithm, the proposed strategy performs much better in terms of precision and recall and it can effectively avoid a biased result caused by celebrity effect and zombie fans effect.},

In ISCF model, the similarity of items was considered in user-based collaborative filtering, which contributes to alleviate the problem of data sparsity and therefore calculate the similarity of user. Experimental results illustrate that our approach ISCF outperforms the average method and user-based CF. Compared with user-based CF, the average improvement in the percentage of ISCF at MAE and RMSE are 21.9% and 17.7%, respectively.

The paper analyzes the emerging Research 2.0 domain using the theoretical framework of Web 2.0 core principles (e.g., web as a platform, harnessing collective intelligence, etc.). These principles, first proposed by Tim O'Reilly, provide a useful lens through which researchers can examine the potential for Web 2.0 technologies in shaping the next generation of research methodologies. To this end, the paper examines how these principles would apply to the research domain, how traditional methodologies used in qualitative and quantitative research can be applied within a Web 2.0 environment, and the challenges and issues that researchers may face in a Research 2.0 domain. The paper identifies key research issues that need to be explored to fully realize the potential of Web 2.0 technologies in conducting qualitative and quantitative research.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube, del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success. State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed.},

Community information systems have been highlighted with the emerging term mobile Social Network. In this paper, we explore the impact of mobile social software on the community of cultural heritage management. Furthermore, mobile and ubiquitous technologies have provided capabilities for more sophisticated approach to cultural heritage management. We analyze these features of mobile information systems for cultural communities. We also present a mobile community framework with mobile Web Services to enable professionals to collect, manage and retrieve cultural heritage information in wide user communities. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in a social network. In a social network, nodes and links represent participants and their friendships, respectively. We have designed and implemented a query propagation mechanism and its applications to realize a social network composed by cellular phone users. In these applications, users can retrieve information from their friends or their friends' friends by propagating the query in the network. To propagate a query in a wide range and improve the query success ratio, most users who receive the query must relay it to all their friends. However, this increases communication packets. In this paper, we propose a query routing method to decrease the number of communication packets by using user profiles.},

  abstract  = {The rise of social media technologies has created new ways to seek and share information for millions of users worldwide, but also has presented new challenges for libraries in meeting users where they are within social spaces. From social networking sites such as Facebook and Google+, and microblogging platforms such as Twitter and Tumblr to the image and video sites of YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, and to geotagging sites such as Foursquare, libraries have responded by establishing footholds within a variety of social media platforms and seeking new ways of engaging with online users in social spaces. Libraries are also responding to new social review sites such as Yelp and Tripadvisor, awareness sites including StumbleUpon, Pinterest, Goodreads, and Reddit, and social question-and-answer (Q&A) sites such as Yahoo! Answers—sites which engage social media users in functions similar to traditional library content curation, readers' advisory, information and referral, and re erence services. Establishing a social media presence extends the library's physical manifestation into virtual space and increases the library's visibility, reach, and impact. However, beyond simply establishing a social presence for the library, a greater challenge is building effective and engaging social media sites that successfully adapt a library's visibility, voice, and presence to the unique contexts, audiences, and cultures within diverse social media sites. This lecture examines the research and theory on social media and libraries, providing an overview of what is known and what is not yet known about libraries and social media. Chapter 1 focuses on the social media environments within which libraries are establishing a presence, including how social media sites differ from each other, yet work together within a social ecosphere. Chapter 2 examines how libraries are engaging with users across a variety of social media platforms and the extent to which libraries are invo ved in using these different social media platforms, as well as the activities of libraries in presenting a social "self," sharing information, and interacting with users via social media. Chapter 3 explores metrics and measures for assessing the impact of the library's activity in social media sites. The book concludes with Chapter 4 on evolving directions for libraries and social media, including potential implications of new and emerging technologies for libraries in social spaces.},

However, the characteristics of mobile devices and tags lead to the performance degradation of the tag-based image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic tagging method exploiting Wikipedia-based associated words. The proposed system consists of two phases. In association words construction phase, extraction manager parses the page information from Wikipedia dump, and then semantic analyzer constructs the associated words using disambiguation page. In tag recommendation phase, a user selects single meaning among various associated words, so that associated words which belong to the chosen cluster are automatically assigned to the contents. The proposed system makes it possible to annotate the multimedia contents with the reliable and relevant tags in the smart device environment.},

We found that social network-based recommendations fused with content information and non-personalized community vote-based recommendations performed the best. Moreover, for cold-start users who have insufficient number of items to express their preferences, the recommendations based on their social connections generated significantly better predictions than other approaches.},

To this end, we developed an algorithm for searching 'similar' URLs based on the similarity of their aggregated tag vectors, which allowed us to identify clusters of similar resources. Our experimental findings demonstrate that massive tagging of resources leads to resource meanings that are defined bottom-up, and they prove the effectiveness of collaborative tagging systems for describing resources.},

Discovering user communities from social networks have become one of the major challenges which help its members to interact with relevant people who have similar interests. Community detection approaches fall into two categories: the first one considers user' networks while the other utilizes usergenerated content. In this paper, a multi-layer community detection model based on identifying topics of interest from user published content is presented. This model applies Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine for modeling user's posts within a social network which yields to identify their topics of interest, and finally construct communities. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-layer model is measured using KL divergence which measures similarity between users of the same community. Experiments on the real Twitter dataset show that the proposed deep model outperforms traditional community detection models that directly maps users into corresponding communities using several baseline techniques.},

In analyzing large dataset with HCA, it is important to improve its efficiency. Motivated by the fact that small quantitative differences may not necessarily reflect changes of qualitative property, we report an interval-radial algorithm for HCA. By grouping data points within a neighborhood, the interval-radial algorithm is O(N^2) for both agglomerative and divisive approaches under an easy to satisfy weak condition. The algorithm can adaptively adjust radius during its execution. Furthermore, the algorithm provides flexibility to users for them to select initial radius and step size such that to produce customized output automatically. We report the algorithm, its analysis, and results of computational experiments on several benchmark datasets. Examples and illustrative dendrograms are included.},

Finding and refinding these notes is a form of navigation that is integral to software maintenance. Although there is some tool support in modern development environments for authoring and navigating these comments, we have observed that these annotations often fail to remind and are sometimes difficult to find by the programmer. To address these shortcomings, we have designed a new approach for software navigation called tags for software engineering activities (TagSEA). TagSEA combines the notion of waypointing (a mechanism for marking locations in spatial navigation) with social tagging to support programmers in defining semantically rich annotations to source code comments. The tool provides support for creating, editing, navigating, and managing these annotations. We present the results from two empirical studies, where we observed and then analyzed how professional programmers used source code annotations to support their development activities over 24 months. Our findings indicate that the addition of semantic information to annotations can improve their value. We also provide suggestions on how annotation tools in general may be improved.},

The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf ·idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative (or social tagging) options are being added to many database catalogs on the assumption that not only those who assign tags but also those who use the catalog find such tags beneficial. But no quantitative analyses of collaborative tags exist to support this assumption. Based on questionnaires mixing collaborative tag clouds from http://www.LibraryThing.com and controlled library of congress subject heading (LCSH) strings from the library of congress catalog http://catalog.loc.gov, it was found that controlled vocabulary terms are selected above collaborative terms; that the string format is preferred to the cloud; that strings appear to ldquoperformrdquo better in terms of reflecting book content; and that it is important to users that recall is high (where uncontrolled vocabulary retrieval is generally low). Results were found to be dependent upon particulars of tag cloud or string. The outcome indicates that catalog users would derive fewer information retrieval benefits from the current form of collaborative clouds than from the staid strings of the Library of Congress Subject Headings.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging systems allow collaborative users to annotate shared resources with tags. Since they rely on user contributed content, social tagging systems are vulnerable to spam annotations, which are generated by malicious users to mislead or confuse legitimate users. Thus, mechanisms for spam detection need to be developed to combat the flexible strategies of spammers for the success of social tagging systems. Since annotations are lack of relevant feature, the classical method of training classifier to detect spam is hard to implement. However, with their collaborative nature, knowledge on the tagging scheme do exists in the way numerous participants annotating resources with tags. In this paper, we propose a simple but remarkably effective approach for detecting tag spam in social tagging systems with collaborative knowledge. We harness the wisdom of crowds to discover the knowledge on what should be high quality annotations for resources. This knowledge is then used to tell spam posts from the legitimate ones. A distinct feature of our approach is that, it can be easily extended for user level spam detection and can do well in both levels. The proposed approach is evaluated on data set collected from real-world system. Experimental results show a convincing performance of proposed approach.},

Then, we jointly learn multiple distance metrics with these extracted multiple features under which the probability of a pair of face image with a kinship relation having a smaller distance than that of the pair without a kinship relation is maximized, and the correlation of different features of the same face sample is maximized, simultaneously, so that complementary and discriminative information is exploited for verification.

But generally traditional methods assume every two items have same significance in database, which is unreasonable in many real applications. This paper addresses the issues of mining concise association rules with different significance, which can lead to reasonable but concise result. We find that weighted itemset search space is enumerable through exploiting the weighted support-significant framework. By adopting specific technique, duplicate search space can be pruned early with little cost. All the weighted closed itemsets are derived directly while enumerating them without many duplicate candidates generation. Then concise association rules based on weights can be generated. As illustrated in experiments, the proposed method leads to good results and achieves good performance.},

One practically important problem is: can the labeled data from other related sources help predict the target task, even if they have (a) different feature spaces (e.g., image vs. text data), (b) different data distributions, and (c) different output spaces? This paper proposes a solution and discusses the conditions where this is possible and highly likely to produce better results. It works by first using spectral embedding to unify the different feature spaces of the target and source data sets, even when they have completely different feature spaces. The principle is to cast into an optimization objective that preserves the original structure of the data, while at the same time, maximizes the similarity between the two. Second, a judicious sample selection strategy is applied to select only those related source examples. At last, a Bayesian-based approach is applied to model the relationship between different output spaces. The three steps can bridge related heterogeneous sources in order to learn the target task. Among the 12 experiment data sets, for example, the images with wavelet-transformed-based features are used to predict another set of images whose features are constructed from color-histogram space. By using these extracted examples from heterogeneous sources, the models can reduce the error rate by as much as ~50%, compared with the methods using only the examples from the target task.},

Many community detection algorithms are designed to process undirected graphs (i.e., graphs with bidirectional edges) but many graphs on the Web - e.g. microblogging Web sites, trust networks or the Web graph itself - are often directed. Few community detection algorithms deal with directed graphs but we lack their experimental comparison. In this paper we evaluated some community detection algorithms across accuracy and scalability. A first group of algorithms (Label Propagation and Infomap) are explicitly designed to manage directed graphs while a second group (e.g., WalkTrap) simply ignores edge directionality; finally, a third group of algorithms (e.g., Eigenvector) maps input graphs onto undirected ones and extracts communities from the symmetrized version of the input graph. We ran our tests on both artificial and real graphs and, on artificial graphs, WalkTrap achieved the highest accuracy, closely followed by other algorithms; Label Propagation has outstanding performance in scalability on both artificial and real graphs. The Infomap algorithm showcased the best trade-off between accuracy and computational performance and, therefore, it has to be considered as a promising tool for Web Data Analytics purposes.},

From the system's perspective, hashtags play an important role in tweet retrieval, event detection, topic tracking, and advertising, etc. Annotating tweets with the right hashtags can lead to a better user experience. However, two problems remain unsolved during an annotation: (1) Before the user decides to create a new hashtag, is there any way to help her/him find out whether some related hashtags have already been created and widely used? (2) Different users may have different preferences for categorizing tweets. However, few work has been done to study the personalization issue in hashtag recommendation. To address the above problems, we propose a statistical model for personalized hashtag recommendation in this paper. With millions of <;tweet, hashtag> pairs being published everyday, we are able to learn the complex mappings from tweets to hashtags with the wisdom of the crowd. Two questions are answered in the model: (1) Different from traditional item recommendation data, users and tweets in Twitter have rich auxiliary information like URLs, mentions, locations, social relations, etc. How can we incorporate these features for hashtag recommendation? (2) Different hashtags have different temporal characteristics. Hashtags related to breaking events in the physical world have strong rise-and-fall temporal pattern while some other hashtags remain stable in the system. How can we incorporate hashtag related features to serve for hashtag recommendation? With all the above factors considered, we show that our model successfully outperforms existing methods on real datasets crawled from Twitter.},

Recommender systems are widely applied in e-commerce websites, they discover users' potential consuming habits by analyzing their behaviors, and then recommend users with what they may purchase. However, recommender systems on e-commerce sites are facing the problem of data sparsity. Data sparsity may cause poor recommendations, thereby reducing users' shopping satisfaction. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a new approach based on the idea that combines user-based collaborative filtering techniques with transfer learning. The method alleviates the data sparsity problem by transferring the knowledge learned from dense data set to sparse ones. We use the data from a glasses site as the dense data set and the data from an underware site as the sparse one, experiments are conducted for evaluating the proposed method in this paper. Results show that our method can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the effect of user based collaborative filtering method.},

  abstract  = {Recommender systems suggest resources to users based on collaborative filtering techniques, typically by exploiting correlations between individual user ratings of the resources they are interested in. Tags are a new form of metadata increasingly used in social bookmarking sites by users to annotate bookmarked resources. Our goal is to harness the implicit knowledge contained in these tags to improve the quality of recommendations to users. We use both tag and resource-interest knowledge in our user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to profile users and compute similarity between them. Sparsity is a challenge which occurs in a Social Recommendation System when the number of tags and resources to profile a user are inadequate to provide good quality recommendations. To address this problem, we designed a Tripartite Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (TRNNA) which combines three views of the data: the tags (TNNA), the resources (RNNA) and the collection of tags for a resource (Resource Vector of Tags or RVTA). TRNNA computes distance between users based on Cosine Similarity, which in turn is used to provide a high quality recommendation of resources. Our empirical evaluation, based on a user study in which research papers were recommended to participants and relevance of recommendation was evaluated, indicates that TRNNA and RNNA provide better recommendation than TNNA and RVTA.},

Despite these efforts, empirical studies show only minor adoption of such methods. To understand how research can contribute to improving the selection of components we interviewed developers from 16 Norwegian software companies which integrate Open Source Software (OSS) components into their systems. We find that the selection of OSS components has a situational nature where project specific properties significantly constrain the selection's outcome, and that developers employ a dasiafirst fitpsila rather than dasiabest fitpsila approach when selecting OSS components. This could explain the limited adoption of normative selection approaches and general evaluation schemas. Moreover, it motivates a shift from developing such methods and schemas towards understanding the situational nature of software selection.},

Other collaborative behaviors are less obvious and may be considered an implicit part of a healthcare consumer's Web activities. One such implicit collaboration is the use of the website Delicious.com to bookmark and tag Web-based healthcare information resources for organization and future retrieval. Tags assigned by an individual are visible to other users, resulting in a peer-created knowledge organization system of information resources. Tags can be created by the user solely for their own use, yet the community benefits from the aggregation of individual efforts. We explore the implicit collaboration through an examination of user contributed tags for consumer health resources on the social tagging website Delicious.com. This work investigates the characteristics of tags for healthcare resources on the web. Tags were collected using two methods. First, we gathered the top 100 published search terms for the consumer health website MedlinePlus, and used these terms to retrieve search results using the Yahoo! BOSS API. We then collected the most frequent Delicious.com tags for the first URL in each search. Second, human users were asked to perform fictional healthcare searches while evaluating a prototype search engine. Returned with search results were Delicious tags we collected and stored for use in guided search and other healthcare information retrieval systems. Evaluation of tags includes user intervi- - ews and comparisons to existing professional medical vocabularies and emerging resources like the Open Access Consumer Health Vocabulary [3]. In the Web2.0 model, peers have emerged as "guides" to health information, minimizing the role of established gatekeepers [4]. Finding credible, high-quality, and comprehensive health information is a continued challenge. Web users also struggle with health literacy and vocabulary gap between clinicians and laypersons. This work may lead to enhanced methods of developing consumer health vocabularies, Web search and browsing guides, and other tools for healthcare information seekers.},

Given a document, the described algorithm finds similar documents that may be of interest to the user. It exploits the metadata typical for the participatory web. In the adopted model, documents are viewed as objects associated with a set of tags and a set of users who have tagged them, inducing tag-based and user-based similarity. The similarity between two documents is computed as a combination of their tag-base and, user-based cosine similarity and the document recency. We have con-ducted a series of experiments using a CiteULike dump to investigate the properties of the proposed similarity measure. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm exploiting meta-information about the documents provides a good approximation of our understanding of the contextual dependency of the notion of similarity.},

This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags.},

  abstract  = {The access to information is essential to learning as much as instruction. The evolution of the Web, from Web 1.0, where we were consumers of information, to a Web 2.0 where now we are producers and consumers of information, has allowed the Web becomes a huge database and in constant expansion. In these days much of the information published on the Web is published on social media, represented through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, to name only the most prominent. Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics, ranging from the length of text that can be used, the use of different forms to identify topics until reaching the reciprocity of relationship between the participants. For example Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called Tweets are exchanged, within the message can be used labels, called hashtags, to identify the subject of the message, the message also may include links to other resources that expand the original content or showing interesting information and the relationships between users are represented as non reciprocal relationships named "Following". The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this research through the use of linked data, that allow retrieving resources and link with other external sources, graphs databases that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis (SNA), technique to discover relevant information that goes beyond the individual properties. The scope of this paper is to use information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend Open Educational Resources in order to help with the learning process. The results obtained are a set of recommendations on users (identified as experts) and virtual communities (lists of Twitter users) and related events, according to the learning needs described as tags.},

An alternative approach is known as character-based. The plot-based approach fails to model the dynamic behaviors of virtual characters. On the other hand, the character-based approach focuses on designing the specific behaviors or actions of the virtual characters.

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

From this distance measure it is straightforward to derive methods to analyze user interest and compute recommendations.

Recollection can be defined as the effort needed to recall an even, an idea or a resource. In IR, when locating an interesting resource, a user can tag it in order to "memorize" it and retrieve it later. The user chooses the tags according to his/her needs or centers of interest. While previous work has addressed the problem of tag exploitation, to our knowledge, an important dimension is missing. None has focused on the tagging activity itself when considering the users point of view. An important open question is the following: will a user be able to remember tags he/she associated with a document in the past in order to retrieve a document again? Our paper tackles this problem. Considering a user study that implied 32 participants, we evaluate some elements (age, time...) that impacts the recognition and the recall of tags used in the past. This result is important specifically as it can be used in order to optimize personalized systems (e.g. user profiling, tag exploitation...).},

Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a method which utilizes social tags as well as the content of academic conference in order to improve automatically identifying academic conference classification. The proposed method applies different automatic classification algorithms to improve classification quality by using social tags. Experimental results show that this method mentioned above performs better than the method which only utilizes the content to classify academic conference with 1% Precision measure score increase and 1.64% F1 measure score increase, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We show in this paper how a Hasse diagram is an efficient visualization strategy for eliciting different groups and navigating through them. However, we do not limit this strategy to these traditional uses. Instead we show how it can also be used for assisting in indexing new photos. Indexing consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a novel way of building the Hasse diagram. To validate the approach, we present some tests conducted with a sample of users that confirm the interest of this organization, visualization and indexation approach. Finally, we conclude by considering scalability, the possibility to extract social networks and automatically create personalised albums.},

Although tag co-occurrence has recently become a hot research topic, many studies mainly focus on how to produce the personalized recommendation leveraging the tag co-occurrence relationship and most of them are considered in a homogeneous network. So far, few studies pay attention to how to predict tag co-occurrence relationship across heterogeneous networks. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel two-step prediction approach. First, weight path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-occurrence relationships. Experiments are performed on real-world dataset, the Flickr network, with comprehensive measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that weight path-based heterogeneous topological features have substantial advantages over commonly used link prediction approaches in predicting co-occurrence relations in information networks.},

A major question is how directive personalization should be. Is visitor satisfaction highest if the system limits the burden of choice, or should it leave a great deal of autonomy to the visitor? This paper reports on two exploratory studies into methods for personalizing digital content presentation in museum exhibitions. The methods differ as to the degree of control they allow the user. Visitor preference for and acceptance of 1) profiling methods, varying as to context sensitivity and 2) presentation methods, varying as to the amount of guidance imposed on visitors by the presentation, were tested using a simulated exhibition. Test visitors varied as to age and museum experience. The main findings are that visitor satisfaction with context sensitive, stepwise profiling was higher than with immediate, abstract profiling; that independent exploration was preferred to directive presentation; that visitor variables had only minor influences throughout on satisfaction with both profiling and guidance methods. Implications of the studies for the implementation of personalized museum visitor support systems may be that using context-sensitive interaction resulting in suggestions to the visitor is a much more successful option than sign-in forms and the like opaque methods instantly returning a profile. In closing we recommend a continuous and adaptive form of profiling during the entire visit, enabling a flexible form of presentation varying as to the degree of guidance.},

These technologies complement formal means of sharing knowledge via conferences and published papers, where it is impossible to share all the research details, and where negative results are rarely included. A small but growing number of scientists and researchers are beginning to harness these Web 2.0 technologies as a transformative way of doing science. With the advent of service oriented architectures, the model of chaining services to create analysis workflows provides the research community unprecedented opportunity to collaborate, sharing their workflows with one another, reproducing and analyzing research results, and leveraging colleagues' expertise to expedite the process of scientific knowledge discovery. A crucial component needed for this unprecedented level of cooperation within the research community is a reusable, extensible and customizable environment for building collaborative Â¿open scienceÂ¿ portals for managing these shared analysis workflows.

Such personalisation is required in order to provide an adaptive Web to users, where content fits their preferences, background and current interests, making the Web more social and relevant. Current techniques analyse user activities on social media systems and collect structured or unstructured sets of entities representing users' interests. These sets of entities, or user profiles of interest, are often missing the semantics of the entities in terms of: (i) popularity and temporal dynamics of the interests on the Social Web and (ii) abstractness of the entities in the real world. State of the art techniques to compute these values are using specific knowledge bases or taxonomies and need to analyse the dynamics of the entities over a period of time. Hence, we propose a real-time, computationally inexpensive, domain independent model for concepts of interest composed of: popularity, temporal dynamics and specificity. We describe and evaluate a novel algorithm for computing specificity leveraging the semantics of Linked Data and evaluate the impact of our model on user profiles of interests.},

To provide diverse suggestion list of communities to join, the proposed framework uses Tensor Decomposition to reveal latent topics among multi-mode data including communities, users and social tags.

There is constant pressure to reduce costs and improve performance and quality. Success demands the ability to continuously learn and adapt. Standardization is recognized as essential to reducing variation and, therefore, costs, as well as managing quality. Public frameworks and standards, such as ITIL® (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), provide best-practice guidance and a common vocabulary for managing IT (information technology) services. In this paper, we explore the role that social networking and “crowdsourcing” can play in socializing and developing best practices for a service delivery organization. We draw on our experience developing and deploying a social networking application, called Cyano, which is being used by approximately 13,000 IT professionals to capture and maintain day-to-day activities, processes, and artifacts used for problem and change management of several hundred outsourced infrastructures. Cyano is a new breed of social networking enterprise applications, in which crowdsourcing is leveraged to enrich and maintain IT processes and social networks are not created by explicit membership, but rather are implicitly discovered by the type of activities and infrastructure elements that various users support. In this paper, we focus on 1) the architecture of Cyano for supporting social tagging and linkage across different layers of management applications, 2) process customization and governance, and 3) an automated recommendation system that has been well received by thousands of IT professionals. We also highlight research challenges in this space.},

Consumers who significantly influence the opinions and decisions of others through communicative acts are called opinion leaders. These leaders usually capture the most representative opinions and play a crucial role in electronic word-of-mouth. Since opinion leaders have different expertise and interests, they are typically topic sensitive. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of identifying topic-sensitive opinion leaders in online review communities, and present a two-stage approach. In Stage I, we derive opinion leaders' interest from their tags. In Stage II, we rank leaders according to not only the link structure of networks but also opinion leaders' personal expertise and interests. A preliminary experiment on real-world data indicates the proposed approach is effective.},

This practice attracts more and more the interest of researchers, because beyond the acquisition of knowledge, the Semantic Web approaches are also producing relevant information that may be used in practical situations. In this direction, we thought to exploit the activities of social Web users, mainly Hashtags. Hence, we focused on the identification of hashtags (as well as their different definitions) for personalized recommendation on e-learning systems. This paper aims at giving an insight on the pioneers' works and the opportunities raised by mixing the Social and the Semantic Web for education on one hand. And give the general architecture of our proposition and results obtained on the other hand.},

  abstract  = {A modified collaborative filtering recommendation has been put forward for clustered data in social networks. Firstly, the basic model is built up, which shows the outline of current existing types of the recommendation platform. Secondly, on this basis, the vertexes and edges in the model are divided as the entities of the social networks with properties given formally. This framework implements traditional collaborative filtering based on clustered datasets using improved k-means clustering method, and our design has put forward to picking up the active users among all of them and let them help our system generate recommendations more precise and faster. Finally, we have crawled through data from two famous movie recommendation websites, MovieLens and Imdb, in the experiment test. From the experiment results, it is concluded that the implemented collaborative filtering recommendation system is performed better than the naive one both in precision and stability, which aims to supply collaborative filtering recommendation and actively contributing recommendation that suits users' tastes, has completed the task of improving collaborative recommendation and reached the expected goals.},

Thus, they are well suited for large-scale data sharing in distributed environments. Most of the existing P2P approaches for data sharing rely on either structured networks (e.g., DHTs) for efficient indexing, or unstructured networks for ease of deployment, or some combination. However, these approaches have some limitations, such as lack of freedom for data placement in DHTs, and high latency and high network traffic in unstructured networks. To address these limitations, gossip protocols which are easy to deploy and scale well, can be exploited. In this book, we will give an overview of these different P2P techniques and architectures, discuss their trade-offs, and illustrate their use for decentralizing several large-scale data sharing applications.

Some people have more than one calling identity for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Discovering multiple identities of an individual can be important for fraud detection, detection of coordinated criminals, collaborative recommendations, and analyses of complete social graph of an individual. To address the challenge of finding identities that belong to a single individual, this paper describes ID-CONNECT, an approach for linking multiple identities of an individual based on that individual's social call graph and call behavior. The approach is based on the assumption that similarity between identities can be better estimated by using both call network and call behavior of identities towards their friends and that the more similar the weighted call graph of two identities, the higher is the similarity between them. ID-CONNECT is a two-step approach: 1) it estimates similarity between identities by incorporating call rate and duration, and 2) it generates sets of candidate identities for each target identity. We experimentally evaluate our approach on different random graph models and compare its performance against other approaches. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly reduces candidate set size (up to 70%) while achieving comparable true positive rate.},

In this paper, we investigate how to enhance Web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method called “Tripartite Clustering” which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information.},

This paper presents a query language for network search and discusses how search queries can be executed in a networked system. The search space consists of named objects that are modeled as sets of attribute-value pairs. The data model is more general than the relational model, and the query language is more expressive than relational calculus. The paper shows that distributed query processing can be performed using an echo algorithm and that name resolution can be embedded in query processing. Finally, two use cases for network search are presented, one in networking and one in cloud computing, the latter backed up by a prototype implementation.},

Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques.},

  abstract  = {A social tagging system, such as del.icio.us and Flickr, allows users to annotate resources (e.g., web pages and photos) with text descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable information for searching, mining, and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result, while some highly-popular resources are over-tagged, most of the resources are under-tagged. Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-based techniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tag specific resources, how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcing environment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this question by observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been tagged a sufficient number of times. We formalize the concepts of tagging quality (TQ) and tagging stability (TS) in measuring the quality of a resource's tag description. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed “budget” (i.e., the amount of money paid for tagging resources). This solution decides the amount of rewards that should be invested on each resource in order to maximize tagging stability. We further propose a few simple, practical, and efficient incentive allocation strategies. On a dataset from del.icio.us, our best strategy provides resources with a close-to-optimal gain in tagging stability.},

  abstract = {Social tagging becomes increasingly important to organize and search large-scale community-contributed photos on social websites. To facilitate generating high-quality social tags, tag recommendation by automatically assigning relevant tags to photos draws particular research interest. In this paper, we focus on the personalized tag recommendation task and try to identify user-preferred, geo-location-specific as well as semantically relevant tags for a photo by leveraging rich contexts of the freely available community-contributed photos. For users and geo-locations, we assume they have different preferred tags assigned to a photo, and propose a subspace learning method to individually uncover the both types of preferences. The goal of our work is to learn a unified subspace shared by the visual and textual domains to make visual features and textual information of photos comparable. Considering the visual feature is a lower level representation on semantics than the textual information, we adopt a progressive learning strategy by additionally introducing an intermediate subspace for the visual domain, and expect it to have consistent local structure with the textual space. Accordingly, the unified subspace is mapped from the intermediate subspace and the textual space respectively. We formulate the above learning problems into a united form, and present an iterative optimization with its convergence proof. Given an untagged photo with its geo-location to a user, the user-preferred and the geo-location-specific tags are found by the nearest neighbor search in the corresponding unified spaces. Then we combine the obtained tags and the visual appearance of the photo to discover the semantically and visually related photos, among which the most frequent tags are used as the recommended tags. Experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Flickr verify the effectivity of the proposed solution.},

In arriving at such solutions, we utilize ontological modeling to provide semantic representation of the conceptual source-code knowledge in software libraries.

Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

This paper proposes the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (IFAHC) algorithm for recommendation using social tagging. The Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) concept is used to represent tag values which are vague and uncertain. IFAHC can cluster items represented by using IFS into different groups.

Strong information protection can be a competitive advantage, but preserving privacy is a real challenge when people use the mobile apps in the smartphone. If they are too lax with privacy preserving, important or sensitive information could be lost. If they are too tight with privacy, making users jump through endless hoops to access the data they need to get their work done, productivity can nosedive. Thus, striking a balance between privacy and usability in mobile applications can be difficult. Leveraging the privacy permission settings in mobile operating systems, our basic idea to address this issue is to provide proper recommendations about the settings so that the users can preserve their sensitive information and maintain the usability of apps. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive recommendation system to implement this idea, which can crowdsource users’ privacy permission settings and generate the recommendations for them accordingly. Besides, our system allows users to provide feedback to revise the recommendations for getting better performance and adapting different scenarios. For the evaluation, we collected users’ preferences from 382 participants on Amazon Technical Turks and released our system to users in the real world for 10 days. According to the study, our system can make appropriate recommendations which can meet participants’ privacy expectation and mobile apps’ usability.},

We argue that code bookmarking can be effectively used to document a developer's findings, to retrieve this valuable knowledge later on, and to share the findings with other team members. We present a tool, called Pollicino, for collective code bookmarking. To gather requirements for our bookmarking tool, we conducted an online survey and interviewed professional software engineers about their current usage and needs of code bookmarks. We describe our approach and the tool we implemented. To assess the tool's effectiveness, adequacy, and usability, we present an exploratory pre-experimental user study we have performed with 11 participants.},

Although numerous efforts have been invested in to the personalisation of dynamic web content, the voluminous and diversified production of continuous online information still poses significant research challenges. In this paper, we propose a profiling mechanism that learns the user access patterns in a dynamic environment like RSS feeds. Main goal of the proposed mechanism is the retrieval optimisation and personalised recommendation of RSS feeds in close to real time. The mechanism allocates personalized time windows based on the learned access patterns and tries to minimize the chances of time-sensitive information from being missed by the user using a delay minimisation algorithm based on Non-homogenous Poisson Process. The mechanism acquires implicit feedback from the user interaction to calculate potential recommendations. The experiments conducted prove the significance of the mechanism in terms of optimised information retrieval and faster adaptation process where it clearly outperforms the other mechanisms in the literature on these properties.},

Motivated by the observation that media contents are usually shared frequently in online communities and thus have a lot of social diffusion records, we propose a novel media annotating approach depending on these social diffusion records instead of metadata. The basic assumption is that the social diffusion records reflect the common interests (CI) between users, which can be analyzed for generating annotations. With this assumption, we present a novel CI-based social diffusion model and translate the automatic annotating task into the CI-based diffusion maximization (CIDM) problem. Moreover, we propose to solve the CIDM problem through two optimization tasks, corresponding to the training and test stages in supervised learning. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach can effectively generate high quality annotations, and thus demonstrate the capability of social diffusion analysis in annotating media.},

  abstract  = {In social networks, where users send messages to each other, the issue of what triggers communication between unrelated users arises: does communication between previously unrelated users depend on friend-of-a-friend type of relationships, common interests, or other factors? In this work, we study the problem of predicting directed communication intention between two users. Link prediction is similar to communication intention in that it uses network structure for prediction. However, these two problems exhibit fundamental differences that originate from their focus. Link prediction uses evidence to predict network structure evolution, whereas our focal point is directed communication initiation between users who are previously not structurally connected. To address this problem, we employ topological evidence in conjunction to transactional information in order to predict communication intention. It is not intuitive whether methods that work well for link prediction would work well in this case. In fact, we show in this work that network or content evidence, when considered separately, are not sufficiently accurate predictors. Our novel approach, which jointly considers local structural properties of users in a social network, in conjunction with their generated content, captures numerous interactions, direct and indirect, social and contextual, which have up to date been considered independently. We performed an empirical study to evaluate our method using an extracted network of directed @-messages sent between users of a corporate micro logging service, which resembles Twitter. We find that our method outperforms state of the art techniques for link prediction. Our findings have implications for a wide range of social web applications, such as contextual expert recommendation for Q&A, new friendship relationships creation, and targeted content delivery.},

Analyzing social media enables us to benefit from the rich source of multimedia in a personalized, adaptive and systematic way for building smart cities environments. This paper proposes an algorithm to fill the gap between the social media resources, user personalized preferences and the collaborative opinions. The algorithm utilizes social tagging to contribute in increasing the quality for searching for places, services, and the discovering communities of the same interest. By exploiting social tagging, we propose a model which analyzes comments and feedback of posts published by users online. We demonstrate how the proposed algorithm can better utilize social information to improve the discovering of relevant items for a given user. The experiment results show feasibility of filtering and matching items of a similar interest for individual users and a social community.},

Attackers may attempt to distort the system's adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. Prior work on recommender systems has shown that studying different attack types, their properties and their impact, can help identify robust algorithms that make these systems more secure and less vulnerable to manipulation.Unlike traditional recommender systems, a tagging system includes multiple retrieval algorithms to facilitate browsing of resources, users and tags. The challenge is, therefore, evaluating the impact of various types of attacks across different navigation options. In this paper we develop a framework for characterizing attacks against tagging systems. We then propose a methodology for evaluating their global impact based on PageRank. Using real data from a popular tagging systems, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of several attack types. Our results help us understand how much effort is needed from an attacker to change the behavior of a tagging system and which attack types are more successful against such systems.},

In such systems, Users are allowed to annotate a particular resource with a freely chosen a set of tags. These user-generated tags can represent users' interests more concise and closer to human understanding. Interests will change over time. Thus, how to describe users' interests and interests transfer path become a big challenge for personalized recommendation systems. In this approach, we propose a variable-length time interval division algorithm and user interest model based on time interval. Then, in order to draw users' interests transfer path over a specific time period, we suggest interest transfer model. After that, we apply a classical community partition algorithm in our approach to separate users into communities. Finally, we raise a novel method to measure users' similarities based on interest transfer model and provide personalized tag recommendation according to similar users' interests in their next time intervals. Experimental results demonstrate the higher precision and recall with our approach than classical user-based collaborative filtering methods.},

Recently social tagging is the important form of document organization in web 2.0, and the tagging as a document descriptor is used to improve the effectiveness of web searching. But a web document usually belongs to various category of tagging, which may lead to the difficulty of browsing web document based on single tagging. This paper explores the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as mathematical tool to analyze the social tagging of web document, and presents a model for web document clustering based on tagging semantic.

We compute a set of significant tag neighbor candidates based on the neighbor frequency and weight, and utilize the most frequent and weighted neighbors to expand an entry query that has terms matching tags. The proposed approach is evaluated using MedWorm medical article collection and standard evaluation methods from the text retrieval conference (TREC). We compared the baseline of 0.353 for Mean Average Precision (MAP), reaching a MAP 0.491 (+39%) with the query expansion. In-depth analysis shows how this strategy is beneficial when compared with different ranks of the retrieval results.},

We proposed approaches to infer user interest on Social media where often multi-modal data (text, image etc.) exists. We use user-generated data from Pinterest.com as a natural expression of users' interests. We consider each pin (image-text pair) as a category label that represents a broad user interest, since users collect images that they like on the social media platform and often assign a category label. This task is useful beyond Pinterest because most user-generated data on the Web is not necessarily readily categorized into interest labels. In addition to predicting users' interests, our main contribution is exploiting a multi-modal space composed of images and text. This is a natural approach since humans express their interests with a combination of modalities. Exploiting multi-modal spaces in this context has received little attention in the literature. We performed eleven experiments using the state-of-the-art image and textual representations, such as convolutional neural networks, word embeddings, and bags of visual and textual words. Our experimental results show that in fact jointly processing image and text increases the overall interest classification accuracy, when compared to uni-modal representations (i.e., using only text or using only images).},

However, many interactions among individuals can be modeled as Prisoner's Dilemma game, which suppresses the emergence of cooperation. In order to provide scalable and robust services in such systems, incentive mechanisms need to be introduced. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism called recommendation incentive mechanism based on evolutionary dynamics(RIMBED). In our RIMBED system, players who pay an additional cost for recommendation service not only can get the information of the opponents, but also can have a higher probability to interact with cooperative individuals. Using the replicator dynamics equations in evolutionary game theory, we mathematically analyze the robustness and effectiveness of our RIMBED system. Meanwhile, simulation experiments can also validate our mathematical analysis. In our RIMBED system, players have three alternative strategies: always cooperative(ALLC), always defective(ALLD) and rational cooperative(RC). No one strategy can dominate the others forever and all the three strategies can survive in our system. When we bring in population invasion and a small mutation, our system can still work at an excellent level.},

  abstract = {In recommender systems user preferences can be fairly dynamic, as users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users.},

We identify the fundamental factors that govern interactions and aim to automatically form friend circles for scenarios, such as, who should I share the photo with in the early morning? Whose post should be listed on top of my Facebook Wall feed at night? We develop a temporal probabilistic model that not only captures temporal tendencies between the query user and each friend candidate but also blends frequency and recency into circle formation. Experimental results on Enron dataset and Call Detail Records prove the effectiveness of dynamic circle formation with proposed temporal probabilistic model.},

  abstract  = {The understanding, framing, and support of learning, working, communicating, and collaborating is media-dependent: tools, materials, and social arrangements have always been involved in defining and conceptualizing these activities. Historically the emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance scholars”. In today's world, most of the significant problems are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending "giftwrapping" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century. The conceptual framework is illustrated by specific developments of social-technical environments that we have designed and evaluated including: collaborative, domain-oriented design environments, environments created by mass collaboration, and courses-as-seeds.},

As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of social tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and evaluated two enhancements of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on Cite ULike, a social tagging service for scientific articles. The result obtained after two phases of evaluation suggests that both enhancements are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms, as we do in our NwCF approach, leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 similarity measure, an alternative to Pearson correlation for calculating the similarity between users and their neighbors, increases the coverage of the recommendation process.},

  abstract  = {With the permission of annotating blog posts with tags, tags has become one of the most important resources used to describe blogger features. However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

Unfortunately, few previous works have ever touched such topics.

To this end, an image heterogeneous graph is first built to integrate various visual features, and then a simultaneous ranking and clustering algorithm is introduced to generate visually and semantically compact image clusters, named visualsets. Based on the visualsets, visualizable concepts are discovered and their visualness scores are estimated. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schema.},

  abstract  = {As online information grows dramatically, search engines such as Google are playing a more and more important role in our lives. Critical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective retrieval model that can rank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research problem in information retrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval models, often referred to as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many different information retrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector space model, these new models have a more sound statistical foundation and can leverage statistical estimation to optimize retrieval parameters. They can also be more easily adapted to model non-traditional and complex retrieval problems. Empirically, they tend to achieve comparable or better performance than a traditional model with less effort on parameter tuning. This book systemati ally reviews the large body of literature on applying statistical language models to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles, empirically effective language models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. All the relevant literature has been synthesized to make it easy for a reader to digest the research progress achieved so far and see the frontier of research in this area. The book also offers practitioners an informative introduction to a set of practically useful language models that can effectively solve a variety of retrieval problems. No prior knowledge about information retrieval is required, but some basic knowledge about probability and statistics would be useful for fully digesting all the details.

In this paper, we introduce an approach to computing document similarity for building document recommender systems. This approach takes into account document internal content, together with social tags and associated users. These three factors are considered as three dimensions of a document in social space. The similarity computation is performed independently in each dimension, and then aggregated according to user preferences. This allows users to customize their views over the document. Experiments have been conducted with the proposed approach using data crawled from Cite Like. Experimental result has confirmed that all three dimensions have important contributions to document similarity computation.},

Histogram of gradient and Support Vector Machine is used for the feature extraction from the video and to get the accurate result respectively.

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.},

ARSA adopts the concept of crowdsourcing which allows users to collaborate in content annotation task. The current version of ARSA has been designed and implemented for the Buddhadasa Indapanno Archives (BIA). The contents are in two formats, (1) audio files and (2) image documents of handwritten and typewritten texts. Both contents are related to Buddhadasa's dhamma teaching. ARSA provides a user-friendly and socially connected interface for volunteers to transcribe audio files and image documents. The transcribed texts could be used to implement a search engine for full-text search or used for preparing printed materials.},

We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of reusing and integrating contents in different applications, like Websites, e-courses, collaborative portals, and new distribution channels, through the usage of friendly interfaces and intelligent techniques for reducing cataloguing effort. As a result, existing contents will be more accessible and enriched through its reuse and inclusion of internet resources.},

Tags are user-supplied access points for information resources, e.g., short labels that characterize pieces of information. As part of long- term research efforts to assess the usefulness of tags for retrieving content from large information spaces, we set up a first experiment in which we investigate the tags people assign to content. We chose a TV-guide that offers recommendations to users on interesting programs according to their tastes to be our case. Participants were asked to tag a number of TV programs. They were also asked to give a rating for the program. The results show a variety of tags. We composed a category scheme of these tags, which on a high level distinguishes between attitude tags, content tags, and self-reference tags. Tags that reflect the genre, the participant's opinion, and the program's characteristics were assigned most often. Surprisingly, no relationship was found between attitude tags and the rating participants have assigned to the program. We feel that the results can be generalized to other settings such as the field of document design and technical communication, including instructional texts.},

Subsequently, we define a new item prediction method which makes use of both user-to-user similarity and item-to-item similarity. Experimental outcomes on Last.fm show some positive results that attest the efficiency of our proposed approach.},

In this paper, we study altmetrics on the article and journal levels, investigating whether the online attention received by research articles is related to scholarly impact or may be due to other factors. We define a new metric, Journal Social Impact (JSI), based on eleven data sources: CiteULike, Mendeley, F1000, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, mainstream news outlets, Google Plus, Pinterest, Reddit, and sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A). We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves, compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities. Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics. Our findings deepen the overall understanding of altmetrics and can assist in validating them.},

  abstract  = {The ability to tag resources with uncontrolled metadata or "folksonomies" is often characterized as one of the central features of "Web 2.0" applications. Folksonomies are said to support emergent classification, where the semantic value of the tags and their relation to one another is worked out through a negotiated process of users applying their selected tags and seeing what others have tagged the same way. Few studies exist to show how folksonomic tagging is actually done, and to what extent users share each other's tagging patterns. In this paper, we present the results of a social network analysis of two months worth of tagging Internet video on the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. The analysis reveals that specific videos are tagged in fairly coherent ways by a relatively tight group of users. However, contrary to our expectations, there does not appear to be much re-use of tags across different content, or even very many users tagging more than a few similar items. Overwhelmingly, specific clusters of tags and users are associated with individual video links. This result suggests that tagging bookmarks is highly local, and the overall collection of tags is unlikely to result in a coherent globally navigable classification system},

  abstract  = {Owing to the dynamics of the business environment in which organizations must adapt to changes quickly, the information systems have recently had to adapt to new situations so that they can keep adding value efficiently and effectively. In the light of this scenario, a new discipline called Service-oriented Systems Engineering (SOSE) has emerged in the academic scene and this has highlighted the disciplined, systematic and quantified development of Service-oriented Computing systems. This discipline is divided into other sub-disciplines, one of these sub-disciplines is Service-oriented Requirements Engineering (SORE) and is concerned with defining processes and methodologies to address the question of services requirements from two different perspectives: service consumers and service providers. In the context of SORE, this paper proposes a WS&i*-RGPS approach that explores some alternatives to the descriptions proposed by the Role, Goal, Process and Service (RGPS) metamodels - an approach in SORE. This involves a new definition that seeks to incorporate the advantages of other models -- established in the literature - with RGPS. Accordingly, this new approach outlines the use of the i* framework to describe the Role and Goal layers and shows the use of WS-BPEL/WSDL to describe the process and service layers. The use of the i* framework sets out the goals for managing different aspects of the systems specification. Among its advantages are stability, support in the detection of conflicts, analysis and negotiation. WS-BPEL/WSDL is chosen because of its maturity and widespread use in the state of practice, which increases the chance of this new approach being adopted by industry.},

PerSAR hybridizes the social and personality behaviours of smart conference attendees. Our recommendation methodology mainly aims to employ an algorithmic framework that computes the personality similarities and tie strengths of conference attendees so that recommendations can be generated for them using a relevant dataset. The experimental results substantiate that our proposed recommendation method is favorable and outperforms other related and contemporary recommendation methods and techniques.},

This formulation allows for decoupling the representation size from the number of used codewords, as well as for better modeling the feature distribution using a separate trainable scaling parameter for each RBF neuron. The resulting network, called retrieval-oriented neural BoF (RN-BoF), is trained using regular back propagation and allows for fast extraction of compact image representations. It is demonstrated that the RN-BoF model is capable of: 1) increasing the object encoding and retrieval speed; 2) reducing the extracted representation size; and 3) increasing the retrieval precision. A symmetry-aware spatial segmentation technique is also proposed to further reduce the encoding time and the storage requirements and allows the method to efficiently scale to large datasets. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques using five different image datasets, including the large-scale YouTube Faces database.},

We carried out evaluations that mainly paid attention on the particularly challenging problem of resources' ambiguity to prove that not all resources shared in folksonomies are relevant resources for Dbpedia ontology.

  abstract  = {Several paradigms for high-level music descriptions have been proposed to develop effective system for browsing and retrieving musical content in large repositories. Such paradigms are based on either categorical or dimensional models. The interest in dimensional models has recently grown a great deal, as they define a semantic relation between concepts through graded descriptions. One problem that affects semantic descriptions is the ambiguity that often arises from using the same descriptor in different contexts. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is important to model and address polysemy, which is the property of words to take on different meanings depending on the use-context. In this paper we propose a Dimensional Contextual Semantic Model for defining semantic relations among descriptors in a context-aware fashion.

The work is usually asynchronous, i.e., not orchestrated by an explicit workflow, some times geographically distributed, and involves the use of a variety of tools which do not always interoperate. Version-control repositories are essential in supporting this collaboration but cannot satisfactorily address the problem of traceability of interdependencies among the artifacts produced by the individual tools. In this demo, we present a new collaboration tool, WikiDev 2.0, that proposes to address these problems by adopting a wiki as the central platform in which to integrate information about the various artifacts of interest and to present views on this information that cut across the individual tool boundaries. We believe that WikiDev 2.0 will advance the degree of each individual team-member's awareness of the status of the project, thus better supporting the overall team collaboration.},

By taking advantage of semantic technologies, it is possible to derive added-value services and applications such as advanced searching services, integration on the citizen profiles, and automatic service requests for actual and potential needs. This paper presents how to fulfill this step in an open and interoperable manner that can be reused in further projects in the domain.},

However, this is still unexploited by software (i.e., contacts are not engaged when software acts to achieve the requirements of a user). Till recently, contacts and social relationships were hard to capture and manage by software and, thus, it was infeasible to use them to empower the operation of software. The emergence of social networks made it possible to realise a new kind of software mediated social relationships which would enable what we call "socially-augmented operation". In this position paper, we propose socially-augmented software, which can benefit from network of contacts of users including individuals and organizations to fulfil their requirements. We articulate our view and discuss fundamental concepts of this new paradigm. A set of research challenges to better enable socially-augmented operations in software development will be also presented in the discussion.},

The usual largeness of these collections requires a vast endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually. As an approach to effectively produce an automated classification of resources, we consider the immense amounts of annotations provided by users on social tagging systems in the form of bookmarks. In this paper, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags to perform a social classification of resources. For this purpose, we have created three large-scale social tagging data sets including tagging data for different types of resources, webpages and books. Those resources are accompanied by categorization data from sound expert-driven taxonomies. We analyze the characteristics of the three social tagging systems and perform an analysis on the usefulness of social tags to perform a social classification of resources that resembles the classification by experts as much as possible. We analyze six different representations using tags and compare to other data sources by using three different settings of SVM classifiers. Finally, we explore combinations of different data sources with tags using classifier committees to best classify the resources.},

Our findings help us describe how task annotations can be used to support a variety of activities fundamental to articulation work within software development. We describe how task management is negotiated between the more formal issue tracking systems and the informal annotations that programmers write within their source code. We report that annotations have different meanings and are dependent on individual, team and community use.

A well-formed representation of location knowledge is desired to cater to the need of location sensing, browsing, navigation and querying. In this paper, we aim to study the semantics of point-of-interest (POI) by exploiting the abundant heterogeneous user generated content (UGC) from different social networks. Our idea is to explore the text descriptions, photos, user check-in patterns, and venue context for location semantic similarity measurement. We argue that the venue semantics play an important role in user check-in behavior. Based on this argument, a unified POI recommendation algorithm is proposed by incorporating venue semantics as a regularizer. In addition to deriving user preference based on user-venue check-in information, we place special emphasis on location semantic similarity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of location semantic similarity and location recommendation over a real world dataset collected from Foursquare and Instagram. Experimental results show that the UGC information can well characterize the venue semantics, which help to improve the recommendation performance.},

Recently, the sharp increase of network scale has become a great challenge for traditional community discovery algorithms. Label propagation algorithm is a semi-supervised machine learning method, which has linear time complexity when coping with large scale networks. However, the output result has less stability and the quality of the output communities still remains to be improved. Therefore, we propose a novel core-leader based label propagation algorithm for community detection called CLBLPA. Firstly, we find core leaders of potential community by using a greedy method. Then we utilize the label influence potential to guide the process of label propagation. Thus we can accelerate the convergence of algorithm and improve the stability of the output. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real networks show that CLBLPA can significantly improve the quality of the output communities.},

  abstract  = {CAQDAS (Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software) has been around since the 1980s but uptake has been slow compared to the uptake of statistical packages among social science researchers using quantitative data. While these packages have improved over the years, they are still not very intuitive but more importantly they are not part of the practice of senior researchers in the field and many researchers who have tried to use this software without support have failed and given up. At the same time, the development of Web 2.0 tools has exploded in recent years. They are intuitive and free or low cost. There are many Web 2.0 tools that would support the analysis of qualitative data - in particular, collaborative analysis in teams. This paper will explore the benefits of using these tools as well as the challenges - especially, issues of privacy, ownership, and lack of affordances offered by current CAQDAS packages.},

Since all such social websites are user-centric, representing users with a good model directly changes the results of the applications. There are many studies which consider users in their models. In this paper, we analyzed such papers and collected different user representation models. Although there is no study which considers time parameter in user representation, we included the time parameter in one of the models. We evaluated the models for two social bookmarking website datasets by visualizing them as a graph with social network analysis, and by calculating f-measure scores for a tag recommendation system. As a result, tag property is considered as the best property to represent a user in such a website.},

In this paper we present an innovation to current VAA design which is based on the introduction of a social network element. We refer to this new type of online tool as a social voting advice application (SVAA). SVAAs extend VAAs by providing (a) community-based recommendations, (b) comparison of users' political opinions, and (c) a channel of user communication. In addition, SVAAs enriched with data mining modules, can operate as citizen sensors recording the sentiment of the electorate on issues and candidates. Drawing on VAA datasets generated by the Preference Matcher research consortium, we evaluate the results of the first VAA-Choose4Greece-which incorporated social voting features and was launched during the landmark Greek national elections of 2012. We demonstrate how an SVAA can provide community based features and, at the same time, serve as a citizen sensor. Evaluation of the proposed techniques is realized on a series of datasets collected from various VAAs, including Choose4Greece. The collection is made available online in order to promote research in the field.},

We instantiated and tested our architecture by developing an application for collecting user emotional feedbacks during the visualization of videos on YouTube.

We define three information diffusion properties of the subnetwork using the numbers of three types of directed 2-edge connected subgraphs, which are basic structures in a directed acyclic graph such as an information diffusion network. Each type of basic structure is related to information scattering, information gathering, or information transmission. We visualized and analyzed the structure of information diffusion networks extracted for other topics. Furthermore, we characterize the information diffusion properties by using the rank correlation coefficient, precision, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and mean average precision (MAP) of three types of information sources: official sites, news sites, and CGMs. We found that the three information diffusion properties have different characteristics and give priority to different types of information sources.},

A fuzzy extension of Formal Concept Analysis model supports the elicitation of implicit knowledge and the content structuring into a conceptual representation.

However, such support walks a fine line: if it provides too little information software engineers will not be able to collaborate effectively, yet if it provides too much, an information overload can occur. To further complicate matters, the information needs of software engineers dynamically change based on their current activity, context and focus. Therefore we assist tool developers by investigating and reporting on the prioritization of information for distributed software engineers based on their current activity and status. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the findings by describing how to apply them in a support tool for distributed software engineers.},

  abstract  = {Co-clustering was proposed to simultaneously cluster objects and features to explore inter-correlated patterns. For example, by analyzing the blog click-through data, one finds the group of users who are interested in a specific group of blogs in order to perform applications such as recommendations. However, it is usually very difficult to achieve good co-clustering quality by just analyzing the object-feature correlation data due to the sparsity of the data and the noise. Meanwhile, one may have some prior knowledge that indicates the internal structure of the co-clusters. For instance, one may find user cluster information from the social network system, and the blog-blog similarity from the social tags or contents. This prior information provides some supervision toward the co-cluster structures, and may help reduce the effect of sparsity and noise. However, most co-clustering algorithms do not use this information and may produce unmeaningful results. In this paper we study the problem of finding the optimal co-clusters when some objects and features are believed to be in the same cluster a priori. A matrix decomposition based approach is proposed to formulate as a trace minimization problem, and solve it efficiently with the selected eigenvectors. The asymptotic complexity of the proposed approach is the same as co-clustering without constraints. Experiments include graph-pattern co-clustering and document-word co-clustering. For instance, in graph-pattern data set, the proposed model can improve the normalized mutual information by as much as 5.5 times and 10 times faster than two naive solutions that expand the edges and vertices in the graphs.},

  abstract = {Research project selection is an important task for government and private research funding agencies. When a large number of research proposals are received, it is common to group them according to their similarities in research disciplines. The grouped proposals are then assigned to the appropriate experts for peer review. Current methods for grouping proposals are based on manual matching of similar research discipline areas and/or keywords. However, the exact research discipline areas of the proposals cannot often be accurately designated by the applicants due to their subjective views and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, rich information in the proposals' full text can be used effectively. Text-mining methods have been proposed to solve the problem by automatically classifying text documents, mainly in English. However, these methods have limitations when dealing with non-English language texts, e.g., Chinese research proposals. This paper presents a novel ontology-based text-mining approach to cluster research proposals based on their similarities in research areas. The method is efficient and effective for clustering research proposals with both English and Chinese texts. The method also includes an optimization model that considers applicants' characteristics for balancing proposals by geographical regions. The proposed method is tested and validated based on the selection process at the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The results can also be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research project selection processes in other government and private research funding agencies.},

This is evident in, for example, the increasing number of tagging systems offering tag clouds for navigational purposes, which hints towards an implicit assumption that tag clouds support efficient navigation. In this paper, we examine and test this assumption from a network-theoretic perspective, and show that in many cases it does not hold. We first model navigation in tagging systems as a bipartite graph of tags and resources and then simulate the navigation process in such a graph. We use network-theoretic properties to analyse the navigability of three tagging datasets with regard to different user interface restrictions imposed by tag clouds. Our results confirm that tag resource networks have efficient navigation properties in theory, but they also show that popular user interface decisions (such as “pagination” combined with reverse-chronological listing of resources) significantly impair the potential of tag clouds as a useful tool for navigation. Based on our findings, we identify a number of avenues for further research and the design of novel tag cloud construction algorithms. Our work is relevant for researchers interested in navigability of emergent hypertext structures, and for engineers seeking to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.},

Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics; for example, Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called tweets are exchanged. The message labels, called hashtags, can be used to identify the subject of the message. The message may also include links to other resources that expand the original content or show interesting information. Another kind of information present in Twitter is the relationship between users, the most common of which is a non-reciprocal relationship named “following.” The scope of this paper is to use the information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend open educational resources, which will be used in the StartUp project. The StartUp project (intelligent training needs assessment and open educational resources to foster entrepreneurship) is co-funded with support from the European Commission under the Lifelong Learning Programme, which has a specific objective to provide effective open educational resources corresponding to individual learning needs. The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this paper through the use of linked data that allow retrieving resources and link them with other external sources, graphs that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis, a technique used to discover relevant information that goes beyond individual properties. The results obtained are a set of recommendations about users (identified as experts), hashtags (thematically related), and URLs (digital resources), according to the main competence areas defined by StartUp.

However, the noisy or incomplete correspondence between the images and tags prohibits them from being leveraged for precise image retrieval and effective management. To tackle the problem of tag refinement, we propose a method of Ranking based Multi-correlation Tensor Factorization (RMTF), to jointly model the ternary relations among user, image, and tag, and further to precisely reconstruct the user-aware image-tag associations as a result. Since the user interest or background can be explored to eliminate the ambiguity of image tags, the proposed RMTF is believed to be superior to the traditional solutions, which only focus on the binary image-tag relations. During the model estimation, we employ a ranking based optimization scheme to interpret the tagging data, in which the pair-wise qualitative difference between positive and negative examples is used, instead of the point-wise 0/1 confidence. Specifically, the positive examples are directly decided by the observed user-image-tag interrelations, while the negative ones are collected with respect to the most semantically and contextually irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on a benchmark Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for tag refinement. We also show attractive performances on two potential applications as the by-products of the ternary relation analysis.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative Filtering systems consider users' social environment to predict what each user may like to visit in a social network i.e. they collect and analyze a large amount of information on users' behavior, activities or preferences and then predict or make suggestions to users. These systems use ranks or tags each user assign to different resources to make predictions. Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents, tag, organize, share and search for contents, are becoming more popular. These social tagging systems have a lot of valuable information, but the data expansion in them is very fast and this has led to the need for recommender systems that will predict what each user may like or need make these suggestions to them. One of the problems in these systems is: “how much can we rely on the similar users, are they trustworthy?”. In this article we use trust metric, which we conclude from users' tagging behavior, beside similarities to give suggestions. Results show considering trust in a collaborative system can lead to better performance in generating suggestions.},

  abstract  = {Generally speaking, two conditions make cognitive search possible: (a) symbolic structures must be present in the environment and (b) these structures must be detectable by a searcher, whose behavior changes based on the structures detected. In this chapter, information search on the Internet is used to illustrate how a theoretical framework of these two conditions can assist our understanding of cognitive search. Discussion begins with information foraging theory (IFT), which predicts how general symbolic structures may exist in an information environment and how the searcher may use these structures to search for information. A computational model called SNIF-ACT (developed based on IFT) is then presented and provides a good match to online information search for specific target information. Because a further component important to cognitive search is the ability to detect and learn useful structures in the environment, discussion follows on how IFT can be extended to explain search behavior that involves incremental learning of the search environment. Illustration is provided on how different forms of semantic structures may exist in the World Wide Web, and how human searchers can learn from these structures to improve their search. Finally, the SNIFACT model is extended to characterize directed and exploratory information foraging behavior in information environments.},

  abstract  = {Webometrics is concerned with measuring aspects of the web: web sites, web pages, parts of web pages, words in web pages, hyperlinks, web search engine results. The importance of the web itself as a communication medium and for hosting an increasingly wide array of documents, from journal articles to holiday brochures, needs no introduction. Given this huge and easily accessible source of information, there are limitless possibilities for measuring or counting on a huge scale (e.g., the number of web sites, the number of web pages, the number of blogs) or on a smaller scale (e.g., the number of web sites in Ireland, the number of web pages in the CNN web site, the number of blogs mentioning Barack Obama before the 2008 presidential campaign). This book argues that it can be useful for social scientists to measure aspects of the web and explains how this can be achieved on both a small and large scale. The book is intended for social scientists with research topics that are wholly or p rtly online (e.g., social networks, news, political communication) and social scientists with offline research topics with an online reflection, even if this is not a core component (e.g., diaspora communities, consumer culture, linguistic change). The book is also intended for library and information science students in the belief that the knowledge and techniques described will be useful for them to guide and aid other social scientists in their research. In addition, the techniques and issues are all directly relevant to library and information science research problems.

  abstract = {With the wide application of Web_2.0 and social software, there are more and more tag-related studies and applications. Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore the tag relations of user interest in these systems and examine the semantic relations of tag usage in terms of user interests. To do this, a classifying method was used to characterize words into seven classes. Experiments were limited to the five areas of interests: music, photography, games, books and videos. Samples were taken from 50 English-language Web pages in the social bookmarking service Delicious. The top 7 tags were extracted from each Web page that was tagged as music, photography, games, books and videos. Via the results of the tag analysis of this study, relationship between tags and user interests were demonstrated. TagReel employed a radial visualization method, which has the advantage of giving an overview of the whole cluster of connection among tags. TagReel can represent the semantic concept of connection between tags and between interests. It can contribute to raising the cognitive power and awareness of tag usage in various categories and show the relative weight of tags.},

Specifically, our system upgrades/degrades the ranks of correct/incorrect content items in search results through introducing personalized users' reliability degrees and responsible users, thus avoiding clients pick unwanted content. Experimental results illustrated our system could effectively defend against tricky tag spam attacks and work better than current prevalent tag search models.},

But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach.},

Also the design of our recommender system is modular. It integrates and accommodates user's preferences by using User Relevance Feedback.

On testing, the prediction paths of a given test example may be required to end at leaf nodes of the label hierarchy. This is called mandatory leaf node prediction (MLNP) and is particularly useful, when the leaf nodes have much stronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes. However, while there have been a lot of MLNP methods in hierarchical multiclass classification, performing MLNP in hierarchical multilabel classification is difficult. In this paper, we propose novel MLNP algorithms that consider the global label hierarchy structure. We show that the joint posterior probability over all the node labels can be efficiently maximized by dynamic programming for label trees, or greedy algorithm for label DAGs. In addition, both algorithms can be further extended for the minimization of the expected symmetric loss. Experiments are performed on real-world MLNP data sets with label trees and label DAGs. The proposed method consistently outperforms other hierarchical and flat multilabel classification methods.},

Moreover the wide availability of the internet gives a new perspective in distance education making e-learning environments crucial to the future of education. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) provide sophisticated tutoring systems using artificial intelligence techniques in computer programs to facilitate instruction. An ITS is able to provide personalized suggestions and adapt to each individual student's knowledge and skills. Furthermore social networking is becoming a part of everyday life for almost every student. Students can benefit from collaboration in e-learning environments especially when this is combined with an ITS.

  abstract  = {In a social tagging system, resources (such as photos, video and web pages) are associated with tags. These tags allow the resources to be effectively searched through tag-based keyword matching using traditional IR techniques. We note that in many such systems, tags of a resource are often assigned by a diverse audience of causal users (taggers). This leads to two issues that gravely affect the effectiveness of resource retrieval: (1) Noise: tags are picked from an uncontrolled vocabulary and are assigned by untrained taggers. The tags are thus noisy features in resource retrieval. (2) A multitude of aspects: different taggers focus on different aspects of a resource. Representing a resource using a flattened bag of tags ignores this important diversity of taggers. To improve the effectiveness of resource retrieval in social tagging systems, we propose CubeLSI - a technique that extends traditional LSI to include taggers as another dimension of feature space of resources. We compare CubeLSI against a number of other tag-based retrieval models and show that CubeLSI significantly outperforms the other models in terms of retrieval accuracy. We also prove two interesting theorems that allow CubeLSI to be very efficiently computed despite the much enlarged feature space it employs.},

In this paper, we identify three important properties that an academic recommendation service could provide for better literature search: personalization, scalability, and exploratory search. With these objectives in mind, we present a web service called theadvisor which helps the users build a strong bibliography by extending the document set obtained after a first-level search. Along with an efficient and personalized recommendation algorithm, the service also features result diversification, relevance feedback, visualization for exploratory search. We explain the design criteria and rationale we employed to make the theadvisor a useful and scalable web service with a thorough evaluation.},

In this paper, we propose a Self-Taught Active Learning (STAL) paradigm, where imperfect labelers are able to learn complementary knowledge from one another to expand their knowledge sets and benefit the underlying active learner. We employ a probabilistic model to characterize the knowledge of each labeler through which a weak labeler can learn complementary knowledge from a stronger peer. As a result, the self-taught active learning process eventually helps achieve high classification accuracy with minimized labeling costs and labeling errors.},

As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, automatically classifying music by genre is a challenging problem. The traditional approaches which solely depending on low-level audio features may not be able to obtain satisfactory results. In recent years, the social tags have emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the web. So, in this paper we propose a novel multi-modal music genre classification approach which uses the acoustic features and the social tags together for classifying music by genre. For the audio content-based classification, we design a new feature selection algorithm called IBFFS (Interaction Based Forward Feature Selection). This algorithm selects the features depending on the pre-computed rules which considering the interaction between the different features. In addition, we are interested in another aspect, that is how performing automatic music genre classification depending on the available tag data. Two classification methods based on the social tags (including music-tags and artist-tags) which crawled from website Last.fm are developed in our work: (1) we use the generative probabilistic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze the music-tags. Then, we can obtain the probability of every tag belonging to each music genre. (2) The starting point of the second method is that music's artist is often associated with music genres more closely. Therefore, we can compute the similarity between the artist-tag vector- to infer which genre the music belongs to. At last, our experimental results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-modal music genre classification approach.},

SNPs have two unique characteristics: frequent content update and small world phenomenon. However, existing works are not able to support these two features simultaneously. To address this problem, we develop a general framework to enable real time personalized top-k query. Our framework is based on a general ranking function that incorporates time freshness, social relevance and textual similarity. To ensure efficient update and query processing, there are two key challenges. The first is to design an index structure that is update-friendly while supporting instant query processing. The second is to efficiently compute the social relevance in a complex graph. To address these challenges, we first design a novel 3D cube inverted index to support efficient pruning on the three dimensions simultaneously. Then we devise a cube based threshold algorithm to retrieve the top-k results, and propose several pruning techniques to optimize the social distance computation, whose cost dominates the query processing. Furthermore, we optimize the 3D index via a hierarchical partition method to enhance our pruning on the social dimension. Extensive experimental results on two real world large datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of our proposed solution.},

A comparison is performed to assess the efficacy of both sources in solving this multi-label classification problem and it is found that the in spite of being expert monitored and better structured, keywords are worse predictors of the genres of movies than tags in most cases.},

Millions of users are playing, tagging, working, and socializing online, demonstrating new forms of collaboration, communication, and intelligence that were hardly imaginable just a short time ago. Social media also helps reshape business models, sway opinions and emotions, and opens up numerous possibilities to study human interaction and collective behavior in an unparalleled scale. This lecture, from a data mining perspective, introduces characteristics of social media, reviews representative tasks of computing with social media, and illustrates associated challenges. It introduces basic concepts, presents state-of-the-art algorithms with easy-to-understand examples, and recommends effective evaluation methods. In particular, we discuss graph-based community detection techniques and many important extensions that handle dynamic, heterogeneous networks i social media. We also demonstrate how discovered patterns of communities can be used for social media mining. The concepts, algorithms, and methods presented in this lecture can help harness the power of social media and support building socially-intelligent systems. This book is an accessible introduction to the study of emph{community detection and mining in social media}. It is an essential reading for students, researchers, and practitioners in disciplines and applications where social media is a key source of data that piques our curiosity to understand, manage, innovate, and excel.

Many methods and techniques have been proposed for image annotation in the last decade and they have shown reasonable performance on standard datasets. Great progress has been made especially in recent couple of years with the development of deep learning models for image content analysis and extraction of content-based concept labels. However, concept objects labels are much more friendly to machine than to users. We consider that more relevant and user-friendly visual labels need to include “context” descriptors. In this study we explore the possibilities to leverage social media content as a resource for visual labeling. We developed a tag extraction system that applies heuristic rules and term weighting method to extract image tags from associated Tweet. The system retrieves tweet-image pairs from public Twitter accounts, analyzes the Tweet, and generates labels for the images. We elaborate on different visual labeling methods, tag analysis and tag refinement methods.},

Firstly, we describe an approach for creating music recommendations based on user-supplied tags that are augmented with a hierarchical structure extracted for top level genres from Dbpedia. In this structure, each genre is represented by its stylistic origins, typical instruments, derivative forms, sub genres and fusion genres. We use this well-organized structure in dimensionality reduction in user and item profiling. We compare two recommenders, one using our method and the other using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in dimensionality reduction. The recommender using our approach outperforms the other. In addition to different dimensionality reduction methods, we evaluate the recommenders with different user profiling methods. Moreover, our approach collects personal interests (favorite movies and television series) from the Face book profiles. These user profiles are then used to find the similarity between users. At the end, items belonging to the most similar users' profiles and having a high score against users' profiles are recommended. Thus, we have focused on a hybrid system using tag-based contextual information of music tracks and user interests acquired from Face book profiles. Initial results are promising such that using similarities of users affects the recommendation positively.},

The process of annotation and tag management by users of social networks is extremely easy and simple; however, it involves serious problems of navigation and search unlike what happens with taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies. The use of fuzzy similarity measures allows the correct identification of syntactic variations when tag lengths are greater or equal than five symbols, been inadequate for smaller length tags. This article presents a method that combines both fuzzy similarity and cosine measures in order to provide a proper classification of tags even with smaller tag lengths. This method allows the proper classification of the 95% of the syntactic variations of tags analyzed in the experiments.},

Moreover, this leads to alleviate some of the problems regarding the use of a natural vocabulary in a faceted classification.

We heavily rely on search engines but most existing search tools are key-word based and they often return search results with low precision and recall. The emerging semantic tagging technology provides an automatic way to generate semantic tags from text. It has drawn more and more interest from text mining research communities. It is critical to study how to utilize semantic tags to improve text mining including clustering, which helps users to enhance their experience of searching and browsing documents. Unfortunately, most previous works on text clustering merely based on content information. A few recent researches take user-generated tags into account, however user generated tags are often noisy, inconsistent, redundant and lack of semantic information and hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a Semantic Text Mining (STeM) framework to generate semantic tags for given documents and then utilize the semantic tags to improve text clustering. Different from the previous works, we represent a document by a combination of domains and high quality noun phrases. We investigate the performance of our methods in two different datasets and the results are evaluated by normalized mutual information. Experiment results demonstrated that our proposed method substantially outperformed the traditional Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) term vector based clustering. We find that incorporating semantic information into document representation is critical to improve the performance of text clustering.},

Moreover, as one of the primary functions of music is to regulate the listener's mood, the individual's short-term music preference may reveal the emotional state of the individual. In light of these observations, this paper presents the first scientific study that exploits the online repository of social data to investigate the connections between a blogger's emotional state, user context manifested in the blog articles, and the content of the music titles the blogger attached to the post. A number of computational models are developed to evaluate the accuracy of different content or context cues in predicting emotional state, using 40,000 pieces of music listening records collected from the social blogging website LiveJournal. Our study shows that it is feasible to computationally model the latent structure underlying music listening and mood regulation. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the content-based and context-based models attains 0.5462 and 0.6851, respectively. The association among user mood, music emotion, and individual's personality is also identified.},

We applied the model to online word-of-mouth communication by assuming heterogeneity across consumers in terms of individual informative actions. Consumers were assumed to communicate with other consumers selectively using one of three policies: random selection, similar-level selection, and higher-level selection. A basic simulation showed that the most effective policy for selecting communication partners depends on the characteristics of the goods under consideration. An agent-based simulation showed that an effective word-of-mouth policy also depends on the characteristics of the goods under consideration. These findings clarify how consumers deal with cognitive limitations in the face of the massive amount of information now available.},

Our main result is a strategy to approximately recover the unknown dictionary using an efficient algorithm. Our algorithm is a clustering-style procedure, where each cluster is used to estimate a dictionary element. The resulting solution can often be further cleaned up to obtain a high accuracy estimate, and we provide one simple scenario where ℓ1-regularized regression can be used for such a second stage.},

One example of such involvement is a process called tagging: users annotate digital items, called resources, with labels, called tags. Tags used for annotation represent users' categorization and perception of resources. As the result a network of interconnected resources and tags is created. Such a network is meant to simplify a search process for relevant content. The paper introduced the idea of constructing fuzzy sets based on the network of resources and tags. One of possible ways of building fuzzy representation of tags is proposed and described here. It is shown how those fuzzy sets can be used for search purposes.},

DSLs offer constructs closer to the vocabulary of the domain which simplifies the adoption of the DSL by endusers. Interestingly enough, the development of DSLs is not a collaborative process itself. In this sense, the goal of this paper is to propose a collaborative infrastructure for the development of DSLs where end-users have a direct and active participation in the evolution of the language. This infrastructure is based on Collaboro, a DSL to represent change proposals, possible solutions and comments arisen during the development and evolution of a language.},

We believe that for greater progress to be made, we must go beyond tags that merely describe objects that are visually represented in the image, towards more user-centric and subjective notions such as emotion, sentiment, and preferences. We focus on the notion of user preferences and show that the order that users list tags on images is correlated to the order of preference over the tags that they provided for the image. While this observation is not completely surprising, to our knowledge, we are the first to explore this aspect of user tagging behavior systematically and report empirical results to support this observation. We argue that this observation can be exploited to help advance the image tagging (and related) communities. Our contributions include: 1.) conducting a user study demonstrating this observation, 2.) collecting a dataset with user tag preferences explicitly collected.},

  abstract  = {This book is the third of a three-part series on taxonomies, and covers putting your taxonomy into use in as many ways as possible to maximize retrieval for your users. Chapter 1 suggests several items to research and consider before you start your implementation and integration process. It explores the different pieces of software that you will need for your system and what features to look for in each. Chapter 2 launches with a discussion of how taxonomy terms can be used within a workflow, connecting two—or more—taxonomies, and intelligent coordination of platforms and taxonomies. Microsoft SharePoint is a widely used and popular program, and I consider their use of taxonomies in this chapter. Following that is a discussion of taxonomies and semantic integration and then the relationship between indexing and the hierarchy of a taxonomy. Chapter 3 (“How is a Taxonomy Connected to Search?”) provides discussions and examples of putting taxonomies into use i practical applications. It discusses displaying content based on search, how taxonomy is connected to search, using a taxonomy to guide a searcher, tools for search, including search engines, crawlers and spiders, and search software, the parts of a search-capable system, and then how to assemble that search-capable system. This chapter also examines how to measure quality in search, the different kinds of search, and theories on search from several famous theoreticians—two from the 18th and 19th centuries, and two contemporary. Following that is a section on inverted files, parsing, discovery, and clustering. While you probably don’t need a comprehensive understanding of these concepts to build a solid, workable system, enough information is provided for the reader to see how they fit into the overall scheme. This chapter concludes with a look at faceted search and some possibilities for search interfaces. Chapter 4, “Implementing a Taxonomy in a Database or on Website,” starts where many content systems really should—with the authors, or at least the people who create the content. This chapter discusses matching up various groups of related data to form connections, data visualization and text analytics, and mobile and e-commerce applications for taxonomies. Finally, Chapter 5 presents some educated guesses about the future of knowledge organization. Table of Contents: List of Figures / Preface / Acknowledgments / On Your Mark, Get Ready …. WAIT!

We propose a multi-mode recommendation algorithm based on higher-order singular value decomposition, and our algorithm handles not only the existing triplets {user, item, tag}, but also the pairs {user, item} with no tags in social tagging system. Meanwhile. We propose a measure for user recommendations. We empirically show that our algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for multi-mode recommendations with a Last.fm dataset.},

  abstract = {Medical information retrieval plays an increasingly important role to help physicians and domain experts to better access medical-related knowledge and information, and support decision making. Integrating the medical knowledge bases has the potential to improve the information retrieval performance through incorporating medical domain knowledge for relevance assessment. However, this is not a trivial task due to the challenges to effectively utilize the domain knowledge in the medical knowledge bases. In this paper, we proposed a novel medical information retrieval system with a two-stage query expansion strategy, which is able to effectively model and incorporate the latent semantic associations to improve the performance. This system consists of two parts. First, we applied a heuristic approach to enhance the widely used pseudo relevance feedback method for more effective query expansion, through iteratively expanding the queries to boost the similarity score between queries and documents. Second, to improve the retrieval performance with structured knowledge bases, we presented a latent semantic relevance model based on tensor factorization to identify semantic association patterns under sparse settings. These identified patterns are then used as inference paths to trigger knowledge-based query expansion in medical information retrieval. Experiments with the TREC CDS 2014 data set: 1) showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly better than the baseline system and the systems reported in TREC CDS 2014 conference, and is comparable with the state-of-the-art systems and 2) demonstrated the capability of tensor-based semantic enrichment methods for medical information retrieval tasks.},

Specifically, we implement tagging as a front-end feature that allows analysts to freely mark what they feel worth externalizing during tracing. We then carry out an experiment to investigate the tagging practices of 28 student analysts in vetting requirements-to-source-code trace matrices. Our study shows that tagging is readily adopted by analysts, tags produced in tracing follow power laws, and tags greatly enhance the precision of analyst-submitted final trace matrices.

Since social tags are usually as signed by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation is another useful information for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem. The results of audio tag annotation and retrieval experiments demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

For service composition to occur, the services in question must be designed and developed in a manner that facilitates their composition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for service design and composition that combines top-down and bottom-up elements. Our approach is driven by faceted, tag-based functional requirements provided by end-users. These requirements describe, at a high-level, the families of compositions that end-users desire. The requirements kick off a top-down service development lifecycle, where enterprise architects and service developers design, develop and test workflows and services, possibly reusing existing flows and services in the process. At runtime, end-users can specify goals, which are satisfied through a bottom-up composition of flows from the available services. The composed flows include those explicitly designed by the architects as well as new ones that are assembled in a serendipitous manner from the available services. With examples from a case study in the financial services domain, we demonstrate our approach for designing and developing services that can be composed into myriad workflows based on end-user goals.},

As a typical representative of web2.0, social tagging not only allows users to better describe and manage web resources, but also provides a great opportunity for the personalized search research, since it contains abundant public personal information. In this paper we propose a user preferences model based on tag clustering. This model is inspired by the Data Field theory. It can depict users' different aspects of interests and dynamically generate users' preferences against different search queries. We apply this model in the data set of flickr. The final ranked pictures are the combination of keywords and users' preference matching.

The information contained in such social tagging reflects the point of view and understanding of the community, presenting a valuable source of information for the discovery of community structure,content and intent. This paper proposes an approach aimed at the use of community based tagging to address problems in link prediction and the discovery of complex user groups in a fleeting and unstructured Web-based environment.

In the proposed method, both temporal and spatial features of visitors are first considered to construct their profiling, and then extract their interests based on visitors' clustering. Finally, highly desired exhibition halls are personalized recommended to proper visitor. The proposed recommender system consists of three modules including relevance module, quality module and integration module. The relevance module is developed to measure the relationship of an automobile exhibition and a visitor, while the quality module is constructed to analyze the quality of each automobile exhibition. The integration module is to combine two modules above for appropriate automobile exhibition. The proposed approach is well validated using a real world dataset, and compared with several baseline models. Our experimental results indicate that in terms of the well-known evaluation metrics, the proposed method can achieves more useful and feasible recommendation results, and our finding highlights that the proposed method can help both visitors to find a more appropriate automobile exhibition halls, and manage officers to reduce more management cost.},

The aim of this strategy is to weight user's interests according to their relevance and freshness. The time awareness weight of an interest is computed by combining the relevance of individuals in the user's egocentric network (computed by taking into account the freshness of their ties) with the information relevance (computed by taking into account its freshness). The experiments on scientific publications networks (DBLP/Mendeley) allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposition compared to the existing time-agnostic egocentric network-based user profiling process.},

Two very popular approaches are the introduction of sophisticated categorization systems (e.g., fruity, woody, and peppery for wines) along with manual product classification performed by experts and the addition of user feedback mechanisms (e.g., ratings or textual reviews). While user feedback typically is easy to collect, for purposes of product search, it cannot be used as easily as this is possible with a systematic categorization scheme. In this paper, we propose an effective method to automatically derive product classifications of high quality from many different kinds of user feedback. Our semi-supervised method combines advanced data extraction methods with state-of-the-art classification algorithms and only requires a small number of training examples to be created manually by experts. We prove the benefits of our approach by performing an extensive evaluation in the movie domain.},

The recommendations are based on the principles of content-based filtering. Such recommendations are complimented with Bayesian Inference based domain reputation meta-information to strengthen the veracity information of the recommended traces. Using actual long-term and short-term perfSONAR traces, we analyze recommendation results and show: a) how the content-based filter recommends the most pertinent traces based on their attributes, and b) the time-variant characteristics of domain reputation. Finally, using synthetic traces, we show the effectiveness of our proposed measurements recommendation scheme in accurately identifying anomaly events for an exemplar use case, and also show how our content filter based recommendation scheme performs better in terms of false alarms in comparison to: a) recommendations that consider partial trace features for filtering, and b) greedy recommendation approaches based on random trace selection.},

In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.},

Traditional rating-oriented methods predict user ratings on items, but they fail to capture user preference among different items. This paper regards recommendation problem as a ranking task and proposes a new ranking-oriented collaborative filtering framework based on ranking aggregation methods. In this framework, recommendation lists are generated according to item rankings given by users who are similar to the target user. Then, a two-step method called BordaRank is proposed to further explain the framework. The method first uses item collaborative filtering to predict unknown ratings and then uses Borda count method to aggregate item rankings of neighbors. Finally, BordaRank is modified as a pure ranking-oriented method, which could be directly applied on the sparse rating matrix without rating prediction as an intermediate step. The methods are evaluated on real world movie rating data. Experimental results show that BordaRank improves the precision and recall of original rating-oriented methods and modified BordaRank also outperforms traditional methods.},

  abstract  = {Graph classification is becoming increasingly popular due to the rapidly rising applications involving data with structural dependency. The wide spread of the graph applications and the inherent complex relationships between graph objects have made the labels of the graph data expensive and/or difficult to obtain, especially for applications involving dynamic changing graph records. While labeled graphs are limited, the copious amounts of unlabeled graphs are often easy to obtain with trivial efforts. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a stream based graph classification model by combining both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Our method, called gSLU, employs an ensemble based framework to partition graph streams into a number of graph chunks each containing some labeled and unlabeled graphs. For each individual chunk, we propose a minimum-redundancy subgraph feature selection module to select a set of informative subgraph features to build a classifier. To tackle the concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the subgraph feature selection can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification. Experiments on real-world graph streams demonstrate clear benefits of using minimum-redundancy subgraph features to build accurate classifiers. By employing instance level weighting, our graph ensemble model can effectively adapt to the concept drifting in the graph stream for classification.},

  abstract  = {With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations.},

  abstract  = {Twitter is a major forum for rapid dissemination of user-provided content in real time. As such, a large proportion of the information it contains is not particularly relevant to many users and in fact is perceived as unwanted 'noise' by many. There has been increased research interest in predicting whether tweets are relevant, newsworthy or credible, using a variety of models and methods. In this paper, we focus on an analysis that highlights the utility of the individual features in Twitter such as hash tags, retweets and mentions for predicting credibility. We first describe a context-based evaluation of the utility of a set of features for predicting manually provided credibility assessments on a corpus of microblog tweets. This is followed by an evaluation of the distribution/presence of each feature across 8 diverse crawls of tweet data. Last, an analysis of feature distribution across dyadic pairs of tweets and retweet chains of various lengths is described. Our results show that the best indicators of credibility include URLs, mentions, retweets and tweet length and that features occur more prominently in data describing emergency and unrest situations.},

Tags have proven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching, mining and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users, and as a result, most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources, while most of the resources receive few tags. Crucially, this incomplete tagging on resources can severely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag, an incentive-based tagging system, which aims at improving tagging quality of resources, by incentivizing taggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In our demonstration, we will show how our system allows users to use simple but powerful strategies to significantly improve the tagging quality of resources.},

This approach uses currently available and free tools in this new application. Co-occurrence networks are a method for visualizing relationships between concepts within written material. The results of a co-occurrence analysis are a network that reflects the relationships between words based on meaning similarities among words and text segments. To illustrate this approach, I applied the methodology of a systematic literature review search that resulted in 391 unique journal articles, books, and reports on identity published in the period from 1995 to 2015. The abstracts, titles, and keywords of these journals were analyzed via linguistic analysis to create a word co-occurrence network of these articles related to identity in science and engineering. Clusters within this network were identified based on word frequency. The results of this research illustrate a hole in the current identity literature in understanding diversity beyond traditional definitions of race, class, and gender. This method has the potential to powerfully convey and embed information about large amounts of data in a single image and offers a new way to report findings from a systematic literature review.},

User-defined tags, however, are so variable in quality that searching on these tags alone is ineffective. One way to improve search in bookmarking systems is by adding more metadata to the user-defined tags to enhance tag quality. Such an approach would add value by incorporating information about the content of the resource while retaining the original user-defined tag. Tags automatically extracted from the resource could be the main source for tag enhancement. This paper describes how users' tags can be enhanced with metadata in the form of additional tags automatically extracted from the original document. An evaluation study shows how the enhanced tag set improved user searching in comparison to using only user-defined tags.},

Answers service. We found that community tagging is related to higher levels of social interactions amongst users. Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics. Thus, appropriate care needs to be taken when designing search, browsing, and recommender features for question discovery.},

For most customers, specifying needs based on product functional requirements is more natural way rather than technical features, especially for high-tech products. Thus, the CRS requires a knowledge design that is able to generate interactions based on product functional requirements appropriately. This paper proposes a design of knowledge by using ontology to overcome this issue. The nature of ontology structure allows us to map functional requirements with technical features of the product. Based on our user study, most of expert users (familiar with product technical features) and novice users (not familiar with product technical features) perceive that the CRS based on our proposed knowledge design is more useful than that of the recommender system based on the technical features.},

  abstract = {Social tagging systems (STSs) allow users to annotate information items (songs, pictures, etc.) to provide them item/tag or even user recommendations. STSs consist of three main types of entities: 1) users; 2) items; and 3) tags. These data usually are represented by a three-order tensor, on which Tucker decomposition (TD) models are performed, such as higher order singular value decomposition. However, TD models require cubic computations for the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, TD models suffer from sparsity that incurs in social tagging data. Thus, TD models have limited applicability to large-scale datasets, due to their computational complexity and data sparsity. In this paper, we use two different ways to compute similarity/distance between tags (i.e., the term frequency - inverse document frequency vector space model and the semantic similarity of tags using the ontology of WordNet). Moreover, to reduce the size of the tensor's dimensions and its data sparsity, we use clustering methods (i.e., k-means, spectral clustering, etc.) for discovering tag clusters, which are the intermediaries between a user's profile and items. Thus, instead of inserting the tag dimension in the tensor, we insert the tag cluster dimension, which is smaller and has less noise, resulting to better item recommendation accuracy. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithm with two real datasets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Collaborative filtering recommendation technique is one the most successful and popular approaches. However, collaborative filtering approach only considers whether or not a user likes a specific resource but does not take into account the reason why she/he likes it. Social tagging systems, a well-known mechanism in various Web 2.0 applications, play a crucial role to deal with this issue. In response, some prior studies have tried to incorporate social tagging systems into traditional recommendation approaches to enhance their performance. In this study, we investigate the effect of tag completeness in tag-based recommendation approach by proposing a tag-expansion-based personalized recommendation (TE-PR) technique to enrich user profiles and resource profiles. According to our empirical evaluation results using CiteULike data set, the tag-expansion-based approach indeed improves the performance of recommendation techniques. Moreover, the expanded resource profiles have significant positive contributions on recommendation performance.},

While the potential has been recognized by many, and progress on the topic has been impressive, we argue that two key questions, i.e., What visual tagging source is most suited for selecting positive training examples to learn video concepts? and What strategy should be used for selecting positive examples from tagged sources?, remain open. As an initial attempt to answer the two questions, we conduct an experimental study using a video search engine which is capable of learning concept detectors from social media, be it socially tagged videos or socially tagged images. Within the video search engine we investigate six strategies of positive examples selection. The performance is evaluated on the challenging TRECVID benchmark 2011 with 400 hours of Internet videos. The new experiments lead to novel and nontrivial findings: (1) tagged images are a better source for learning video concepts from the web, (2) selecting tag relevant examples as positives for learning video concepts is always beneficial and it can be done automatically and (3) the best source and strategy compare favorably against several present-day methods.},

To make code tagging more fun, we introduce a social gasification approach: developers independently tag code fragments and are rewarded if their solutions conform to the solution of other developers. We implemented the game as a Facebook plug-in. A pilot user study suggests that the game mechanics are motivating and promote the proposition of reasonable tags.},

Although many works have been reported on folksonomy based taxonomy construction, few attentions have been paid to the data preparation for the construction from the behavior perspective. To ensure constructing taxonomy with qualified folksonomy, a method is proposed in the paper to find representative tagging users, so called folksonomy experts, tending to perform representative tagging behaviors. The evaluation confirms that the proposed method is capable of finding folksonomy experts. The method proposed can be utilized to select qualified representative data for the existing folksonomy based taxonomy construction algorithms.},

Despite with many advanced functions, online social interactions can hardly provide online social users with real-world (i.e., offline) social interactions. In this paper, we present an offline friend recommendation system for the OSNS users to have more serendipitous offline interactions. For that, we modeled both offline information (i.e., place visit history) and online social data (i.e., friend relationships) for recommending their offline interactions. Our system discovers those who seems most likely to have potential friend relationship so as to meet in the physical world. We present the design and implementation of our proposed system and conduct real-world experiment to show how the place visit information and online friend relationship together produce a new offline social networking service.},

Existing intelligent argumentation systems allow multiple stakeholders from distributed geographical locations to share their opinions and contribute to a decision making process. In the current system, a stakeholder needs to read all the existing arguments posted by other stakeholders before contributing his/her own ideas/arguments. However, when information accumulates and an argumentation network becomes considerably large, it will cost tremendous time and effort for the stakeholder to read and comprehend all existing arguments. In this paper, we propose methods to implement a recommendation component built into an intelligent argumentation system. The recommendation component can automatically assist a stakeholder to better understand the current state of an argumentation by summarizing and identifying a subset of existing arguments that are relevant to the stakeholder. Thus, our proposed work will allow a stakeholder to efficiently and effectively express his/her thoughts in an intelligent argumentation system in relevant argumentation thread. We also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation component, and the empirical results indicate it is effective according to a real dataset.},

Tag-based image search is an important method to find images contributed by social users in such social websites. However, how to make the top ranked result relevant and, with diversity, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a social re-ranking system for tag-based image retrieval with the consideration of an image's relevance and diversity. We aim at re-ranking images according to their visual information, semantic information, and social clues. The initial results include images contributed by different social users. Usually each user contributes several images. First, we sort these images by inter-user re-ranking. Users that have higher contribution to the given query rank higher. Then we sequentially implement intra-user re-ranking on the ranked user's image set, and only the most relevant image from each user's image set is selected. These selected images compose the final retrieved results. We build an inverted index structure for the social image dataset to accelerate the searching process. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset show that our social re-ranking method is effective and efficient.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral anomaly detection (AD) is an important problem in remote sensing field. It can make full use of the spectral differences to discover certain potential interesting regions without any target priors. Traditional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detectors assume the background spectrum distribution conforms to a Gaussian distribution. However, this and other similar distributions may not be satisfied for the real hyperspectral images. Moreover, the background statistics are susceptible to contamination of anomaly targets which will lead to a high false-positive rate. To address these intrinsic problems, this paper proposes a novel AD method based on the graph theory. We first construct a vertex- and edge-weighted graph and then utilize a pixel selection process to locate the anomaly targets. Two contributions are claimed in this paper: 1) no background distributions are required which makes the method more adaptive and 2) both the vertex and edge weights are considered which enables a more accurate detection performance and better robustness to noise. Intensive experiments on the simulated and real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other benchmark competitors. In addition, the robustness of the proposed method has been validated by using various window sizes. This experimental result also demonstrates the valuable characteristic of less computational complexity and less parameter tuning for real applications.},

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. Moreover, traditional recommender systems consider only the rating information, resulting in the loss of flexibility. Tagging has recently emerged as a popular way for users to annotate, organize and share resources on the Web. Several research tasks have shown that tags can represent userspsila judgments about Web contents quite accurately. In the light of the facts that both the rating activity and tagging activity can reflect userspsila opinions, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach called TagRec based on a unified probabilistic matrix factorization by utilizing both userspsila tagging information and rating information. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets. Furthermore, experimental results on MovieLens data set show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {Many images uploaded to social networks are related to travel, since people consider traveling to be an important event in their life. However, a significant amount of travel images on the Internet lack proper geographical annotations or tags. In many cases, the images are tagged manually. One way to make this time-consuming manual tagging process more efficient is to propagate tags from a small set of tagged images to the larger set of untagged images automatically. In this paper, we present a system for automatic geotag propagation in images based on the similarity between image content (famous landmarks) and its context (associated geotags). In such a scenario, however, an incorrect or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated propagation system. Therefore, for reliable geotags propagation, we suggest adopting a user trust model based on social feedback from the users of the photo-sharing system. We compare this socially-driven approach with other user trust models via experiments and subjective testing on an image database of various famous landmarks. Results demonstrate that relying on user feedback is more efficient, since the number of propagated tags more than doubles without loss of accuracy compared to using other models or propagating without trust modeling.},

In this trend, the need for effective Information Retrieval (IR) technique has been increased. Although document data contain much more abundant information, users can retrieve necessary information only from the title and description in conventional web services. In order to meet the demands for fast and accurate retrieval of valuable information, we propose a fast and effective content-based document information retrieval system that retrieves the information from the actual content of a document. The proposed method is based on a topic model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is used to extract major keywords for a given document. The main contributions of our system are the increased flexibility, effectiveness, and fast retrieval of information. Our system can easily communicate with existing web service through the standard JSON format. In addition, we increase the speed of information retrieval by using NoSQL based database system with inverted indexing and B-tree based indexing. We validate the performance of our system on real data collected from the SlideShare service. The proposed system shows better retrieval performance over the existing IR system.},

Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

Though online social networks (OSNs) stand as a powerful tool to extend existing online learning management systems (LMSs) by using them as a gateway to OSNs, LMSs do not exploit fully the advantages of an active social environment for reinforcing the learning experience. We report in this paper the design, development and use of a software platform which enlarges and adapts the basic features of an OSN in order to be useful for very general learning environments. The software allows the creation, assessment and reporting of a range of collaborative activities based on social interactions among the students, and offers a reward mechanism by means of ranking and reputation. We argue that this approach is helpful in increasing the students' motivation, besides improving the learning experience and performance. The software has been tested in an undergraduate course about computer networks. Different tests confirm that the impact on learning success is statistically significant and positive.},

  abstract  = {Automatic annotation of images is of crucial importance in image retrieval and management systems. Most of the existing annotation methods rely on content-based approach to annotation, whose effectiveness is restricted due to the semantic gap between low-level features and semantic annotations, as well as the irrelevance between annotations and image content. Recently, social media analysis has been investigated for image annotation. Inspired by the abundant social diffusion records of images in online social networks, we propose a novel image annotation approach based on social diffusion analysis. We present a common-interest model to interpret social diffusion, i.e. different images have different social diffusion routes due to the preferences of users, and such preferences are represented as common interests of pairwise users rather than personalized interests. We propose an image annotation framework that consists of learning of common interests, feature extraction from social diffusion records, and automatic annotation by learning to rank. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms content-based and user-preference-based annotation methods.},

All the tags used and resources collected by a user constitute the userpsilas personal tag space, which contains valuable information that can be used for building and enhancing the user model. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine user profile from onepsilas personal tag space. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model onepsilas personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We define several properties for each concept generated to evaluate the degree of such concept to depict the userpsilas interest, and then a novel algorithm is introduced to construct a hierarchical user profile from the built lattice. Experiments are carried out on the dataset collected from delicious and a detailed real-life case study is presented. Results show that the hierarchical user profile can describe the target userpsilas interests well enough, as well as organizing and browsing the tags and collocated resources effectively. Several research issues and technical details are discussed to further improve tag-based user profile for personalized services in the end.},

Consequentially, users have trouble finding social media suited to their needs. To help users in ambient environment get relevant media tailored to their interests, we propose a new method which adapts the Katz measure, a path-ensemble based proximity measure, for the use in social tagging services. We model the ternary relations among user, resource and tag as a weighted, undirected tripartite graph. We then apply the Katz measure to this graph, and exploit it to provide personalized recommendation for individual users within ambient intelligence environments.

We conduct the first study that surveys the literature related to social authentication. In this paper, we not only created a taxonomy for classifying all social authentication schemes deployed in online or physical social contexts and extensively analyzed their authentication features, but also built a novel framework for evaluating the effectiveness of all social authentication schemes, identified all the practical and theoretical attacks that may be mounted against such schemes, addressed possible defense strategies, and identified challenges, open questions, and future research opportunities. To measure their accuracy, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, as well as to identify the potential of knowledge-based and trust-based social authentication schemes, a comprehensive comparative assessment of the security, usability, and deployability was conducted. We hope, by providing a solid foundation for gaining sufficient understanding of the manners in which users' social interactions have been utilized in user authentication schemes and their corresponding security implications, we will guide future research in this domain.},

For Web services, however, it is difficult for user to collect personalized QoS (Quality of Service)data and other explicit feedbacks such as ratings. In most cases, only a part of the implicit feedbacks (e.g., watchlist) is available in service registry. In this paper, we leverage implicit feedback from user's watchlist to build a CF-based recommender system for Web service. Our main contribution is to transform implicit feedbacks into explicit ratings to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. More specifically, we first construct binary user-service rating matrix according to the implicit feedback from the watchlist. Then, temporal and tag preference are combined into the original rating matrix to generate a more accurate pseudo rating matrix, which can reflect users' different preference on services in their own watchlists. Finally, we use traditional user-based CF method to produce a personalized service recommendation list with corresponding pseudo ratings. Moreover, the empirical experiments based on ProgrammableWeb show that compared with traditional log-based CF method, the recommender system with temporal and tag preference is more accurate and precise.},

  abstract  = {Automatic photo annotation task aims to describe the semantic content by detecting high level concepts. Most existing approaches are performed by training independent concept detectors omitting the interdependencies between concepts. The obtained annotations are often not so satisfactory. Therefore, a process of annotation refinement is mondatory to improve the imprecise annotation results. Recently, harnessing the contextual correlation between concepts is shown to be an important resource to improve concept detection. In this paper, we propose a new context based concept detection process. For this purpose, we define a new semantic measure called Second order Co-occurence Flickr context similarity (SOCFCS), which aggregates the FCS values of common Flickr related-tags of two target concepts in order to calculate their relative semantic context relatedness (SCR). Our proposed measure is applied to build a concept network as the context space. A Random Walk with Restart process is performed over this network to refine the annotation results by exploring the contextual correlation among concepts. Experimental studies are conducted on ImageCLEF 2011 Collection containing 99 concepts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Meta-data, accompanying the raw data, can assist data manipulation and processing, e.g. the tags assigned to social images. Many systems for automatic image tagging are based on pair-wise relations. Recent approaches focus on relations among multiple vertices (i.e. items), which are respresented as hyperedges in a hypergraph. In this work, an image tagging methodology is proposed that exploits a factorization of a tensor, capturing high-order relations among multiple Flickr images. The proposed approach uses an extended graph, where the vertices represent images as well as users. By analysing the data communities and their similarities, image annotation is proposed.},

  abstract  = {High-Order Co-Clustering (HOCC) methods have attracted high attention in recent years because of their ability to cluster multiple types of objects simultaneously using all available information. During the clustering process, HOCC methods exploit object co-occurrence information, i.e., inter-type relationships amongst different types of objects as well as object affinity information, i.e., intra-type relationships amongst the same types of objects. However, it is difficult to learn accurate intra-type relationships in the presence of noise and outliers. Existing HOCC methods consider the p nearest neighbours based on Euclidean distance for the intra-type relationships, which leads to incomplete and inaccurate intra-type relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel HOCC method that incorporates multiple subspace learning with a heterogeneous manifold ensemble to learn complete and accurate intra-type relationships. Multiple subspace learning reconstructs the similarity between any pair of objects that belong to the same subspace. The heterogeneous manifold ensemble is created based on two-types of intra-type relationships learnt using p-nearest-neighbour graph and multiple subspaces learning. Moreover, in order to make sure the robustness of clustering process, we introduce a sparse error matrix into matrix decomposition and develop a novel iterative algorithm. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method achieves improved results over the state-of-art HOCC methods for FScore and NMI.},

The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application. However, existing surveys are either outdated or they focus only on a few methods. As a result, there is an increasing need to summarize the obtained knowledge in a concise, yet informative manner. Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as this task poses significant challenges due to varying conditions during data acquisition. In addition, face verification is a natural application for distance metric learning because the encountered challenge is to define a distance function that: 1) accurately expresses the notion of similarity for verification; 2) is robust to noisy data; 3) generalizes well to unseen subjects; and 4) scales well with the dimensionality and number of training samples. In particular, we utilize well-tested features to assess the performance of selected methods following the experimental protocol of the state-of-the-art database labeled faces in the wild. A summary of the results is presented along with a discussion of the insights obtained and lessons learned by employing the corresponding algorithms.},

Cast differently, classification of user-generated content into generalized categories is the equivalent of automated programs trying to match human adjudged labels. It seems logical to suspect that identification and incorporation of features generally found salient by humans or “focal points”, can allow an automated agent to better match human adjudged labels in classification tasks. In this paper, we leverage this correspondence, by using domain-specific focal points to further inform the classification algorithms of the inherent human biases. We empirically evaluate our method, by classifying YouTube videos using user-annotated tags. Improvements in classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art classification techniques on using our transformed (using focal points) and highly reduced feature space reveals the value of the approach in subjective classification tasks.},

Discovering the correlations among different tags can significantly help predicting precise labels for videos and images. Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty. By casting the video concept detection and image annotation tasks into a sparse multi-label transfer learning framework in this paper, ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, and the multi-label extended sparse discriminant analysis methods are, respectively, well explored and compared.},

LMSs (Learning Management Systems) include such collaborative tools to enable knowledge sharing. Common topology and design constructs of online collaboration are often expressed as forum threads; however, forums or bulletin boards are not primarily designed for social constructivist learning, in which knowledge develops collaboratively in a methodical process that links new items to existing ones. In this paper, we present a preliminary concept and hypothesize that social constructivist learning can be implemented through a semantic network topology of a discussion platform. To that end, we developed Ligilo, a peer-learning, online platform, in which each content item is conveyed as a node in a semantic network constructed of posts. Analysis of this platform consists of three parts. First, we review the theoretical background of networked-structured discussions in learning. Then, we describe the architecture of Ligilo, focusing on two aspects: (1) the learning experience as a process of contributing new information items by relating to existing items and (2) a deep, behavioral analytics framework as a teacher's guide. Both these aspects are based on semantic network topology. We conclude the paper by describing some early cases of peer learning involving networked-structured discussions.},

Making annotation on documents, however, is a hard work because people need to read documents very carefully to think which sentences in documents can be annotated. People spent much time for choosing sentences and thinking what annotations they make on sentences. If people are automatically given sentences recommended to make annotations on, people can make annotations on documents easily with shaving off time. New methods for recommending sentences which can be made annotations on are required. This paper proposes an extraction method of sentences recommended to make annotations on for understanding writer's opinions in a document. The method extracts sentences including writer's opinions by evaluating words included in sentences. If a sentence includes words used for showing writer's opinions, the method extracts the sentence to recommend users to make annotations on. Users of the proposed method can understand writer's opinions deeply by reading a document and making annotations on the extracted sentences. We experimented with the proposed method and verified that the proposed method can extract sentences which are made annotations on by participants for understanding writer's opinions deeply.},

It is possible to construct semantic relationships among tags. To do this, one way of building of relationships among tags is use of a popularized tag as a thing of ontology. However, it is not easy to select the popularized tag from tag cloud and to build a complete ontology with all of tags in the tag-cloud because tags are timely and dynamically updated added with tremendous numbers of tags. Therefore, we construct Primitive Ontologies (POs). A general tag is used to as a thing of a PO. The general tag is matched into one of requested keywords by users. In addition, we propose a methodology to evolve ontology using tags. To construct and evolve a PO, it defines classes and relationships between given tags by a user. Finally, the constructed several POs are integrated into a Tag-Based integrated Semantic ontology (TBiSont) by building relationships between classes that are included in each different PO. The construction of relationships among tags depends on linked resources into tags. The properties of tags are usually characterized by linked resources. It causes to extract semantic relationships among tags, because tags are comprised of meta-information that represents properties of resources. Thereby, the proposed PO is constructed by a general tag as a best-referring tag and relationships among tags including the general tag. The TBiSont as an integration of POs was applied into data analysis and a search process to verify efficiency of as in application systems. When we applied TBiSont into searching, it shows that TBiSont is more efficient than the other statistical-based search systems to increase accuracy or diversity of search results.},

The rich cross-media information carried by the multimodal data in multiple media has a wide audience, deeply reflects the social realities, and brings about much greater social impact than any single media information. Therefore, automatically detecting topics from cross media is of great benefit for the organizations (i.e., advertising agencies and governments) that care about the social opinions. However, cross-media topic detection is challenging from the following aspects: 1) the multimodal data from different media often involve distinct characteristics and 2) topics are presented in an arbitrary manner among the noisy web data. In this paper, we propose a multimodality fusion framework and a topic recovery (TR) approach to effectively detect topics from cross-media data. The multimodality fusion framework flexibly incorporates the heterogeneous multimodal data into a multimodality graph, which takes full advantage from the rich cross-media information to effectively detect topic candidates (T.C.). The TR approach solidly improves the entirety and purity of detected topics by: 1) merging the T.C. that are highly relevant themes of the same real topic and 2) filtering out the less-relevant noise data in the merged T.C. Extensive experiments on both single-media and cross-media data sets demonstrate the promising flexibility and effectiveness of our method in detecting topics from cross media.},

Specifically, the paper reports on a study of Twitter messages ("tweets") during four different events. Tweets were collected and those containing links were analyzed. The findings from this study encourage us to proceed to the next stage of the research which is to develop and test a social navigation tool on websites incorporating information from social media in order to improve navigation within a website.},

Existing approaches which deals with such recommendation system apply collaborative filtering techniques to specify the most alike users whom they hope to make recommendations. Collaborative Filtering will significantly show better improvement with the enclosure of real data extraction from the suitable tagging system. In this paper, data from social tagging systems are extracted for every individual considering the correlations between users, items, and tag information. Tag information from users is the most decisive factor to predict the personalized suggestion for web users. Here, we rank the available content based tag information with the inclusion of temporal decay of users' behavior over time and the centrality of every node in the network. Finally, we use the common preference metric for effective personalization. Results have been experimentally demonstrated with the empirical dataset MovieLens and provided the results as an alternative recommendation method with simplicity and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Tag recommendation is an integral part of any bookmarking application. With the growing popularity in Web 2.0 usage, recommending tags is of utmost importance in enabling a user to perform bookmarking easily. An issue that most recommendation systems do not consider is that users have a tendency to choose from tags that are suggested to them, which might bias the true popular rankings of tags. In this paper we consider the problem of tag recommendation for bookmarks based on user feedback. We propose an approach for automatic tag recommendation by using a suggestion set and discuss a randomized suggestion rule for learning the true popular tags. As our algorithm depends on the frequency of tag suggestions, the action of spammers and malicious users may result in skewed ranking of tags for a bookmark. Hence, there arises a need to identify malicious users and spam posts to reinforce the efficiency of our algorithm because spammers can easily mislead a system. We have proposed an approach for classifying spammers based on tagging history of users. Our approach basically estimates the probability of a user being a spammer by analyzing previous posts and tags. Our analysis on a dataset of a popular bookmarking site shows that the proposed method is effective in suggesting the true popular tags and identifying spammers.},

  abstract  = {Making sense of Twitter data streams is challenging due to the extremely high volume of data. One way to address this challenge is to consider these data streams as containing a set of high-level topics. In this research we address the problem of: given a collection of tweets about K high-level topics, how to find topic words that describe these topics as well as how to label each tweet with one of the K topics using a topic modeling approach. Current research has shown that applying topic modeling algorithms directly on tweets does not lead to good results. Hence one approach is to group related tweets together, so as to form a single “pseudo-document”, which is more informative than a single tweet. In this paper we evaluate different grouping schemes found in the literature and propose a new grouping scheme utilizing named entities and word collocations. Results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the existing approaches, to a some extent for all the test cases, and for both finding high-level topics and tweet labeling.},

However, as the social network services always contain large amounts of information on different topics, and people have different influence on different topic, so the group recommendation systems should take the topic identification in large-scale social networks into account to get an appropriate recommendation. In this paper, we proposed a new group recommendation method, which combines topic identification and social networks for group recommendation. In detail, we firstly identify different topical sub-groups by topics in social networks. Secondly, different user factors are used to calculate the user influence (including individual and social) on the topical sub-groups, which can depict the topical sub-group characteristics in different points of view. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the prediction accuracy of the group recommendation.},

However, such support -- and therefore IDEs as awhole -- operate on one revision of the code at a time, and leave handling of code history to external tools or plugins, such asEGit for Eclipse. For example, when a method is removed froma class, developers can no longer find the method through code completion. This forces developers to manually switch across different revisions or resort to using external tools when they need to learn about previous code revisions.We propose a novel approach of adding a temporal dimensionto IDEs, enabling code completion and navigation to operate on multiple revisions of code at a time. We previously introduced the idea of temporal code completion and navigation,and presented a vision for how that idea may be realized.This paper realizes that vision by implementing and evaluatinga prototype tool called Tempura. We describe our algorithmfor processing and indexing historical code information from repositories for Tempura, and demonstrate Tempura's scalability with three large Eclipse projects. We also evaluate Tempura's usability through a controlled user study. The study participantslearned about the code history with more accuracy when usingTempura compared to EGit. Although the sample size was notlarge enough to provide strong statistical significance, the resultsshow a promising outlook for our approach.},

Global labels, i.e., atomic information describing a music title in its entirety, such as its genre, mood, main instruments, or type of vocals, are entered by humans. Classifiers are trained to map audio features to these labels. However, the performances of these classifiers on individual labels are rarely satisfactory. In the case we have to predict several labels simultaneously, we introduce a correction scheme to improve these performances. In this scheme-an instance of the classifier fusion paradigm-an extra layer of classifiers is built to exploit redundancies between labels and correct some of the errors coming from the individual acoustic classifiers. We describe a series of experiments aiming at validating this approach on a large-scale database of music and metadata (about 30 000 titles and 600 labels per title). The experiments show that the approach brings statistically significant improvements.},

The main idea behind tagging is to allow users to provide metadata to the web content from their perspective to facilitate categorization and retrieval. There are many factors that influence users' tag choice. Many studies have been conducted to reveal these factors by analysing tagging data. This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging.},

In this paper, we attempt to exploit a new interaction data, namely print logs, where each record is printing URLs selected by a user using a popular web printing tool. Users usually print web contents based on an intention (subtask or task). Apparently, mining common print tasks from print logs is able to capture users' intentions, which undoubtedly benefits many web applications, such as task oriented recommendation and behavior targeting. However, it is not an easy job to perform this due to the difficulty of URL topic representation and task formulation. To this end, we propose a general framework, named UPT (Users Print Tasks mining framework), for mining print tasks from print logs. Specifically, we attempt to leverage delicious (a social book marking web service) as an external thesaurus to expand the expression of each URL by selecting tags associated with the domain of each URL. Then, we construct a tag co-occurrence graph where similar tags can be clustered as subtasks. If we view each subtask as an item, then the print log is transformed to a transaction database, on which an efficient pattern mining algorithm is proposed to induce tasks. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments on a real print log.},

This domain is shifting radically from the amplified data growth to the way in which it is structured and retrieved across web. This explosive growth of data is the result of billions of people using the Internet and mobile devices for commerce, entertainment, social interactions and as well as the Internet of things that constantly share machine-generated data. Even with lot of research, the task of analyzing this data to extract its business values with precision still remains as a trivial issue. To address this issue, the paper presents a novel Semantic Based Lesk Algorithm (SBLA), which traces the meaning of user defined tags and categorizes the web data by means of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. On comparing with existing methods, the proposed method performs well in extraction of admissible data with the better accuracy and precision as discussed in result analysis.},

Both visual information and tags have been investigated in the research field. However, most existing methods use tags and visual characteristics either separately or sequentially in order to estimate the relevance of images. In this paper, we propose an approach that simultaneously utilizes both visual and textual information to estimate the relevance of user tagged images. The relevance estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In this method, a social image hypergraph is constructed, where vertices represent images and hyperedges represent visual or textual terms. Learning is achieved with use of a set of pseudo-positive images, where the weights of hyperedges are updated throughout the learning process. In this way, the impact of different tags and visual words can be automatically modulated. Comparative results of the experiments conducted on a dataset including 370+images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {On a crowdsourcing platform consisting of requestersand workers, it is a challenge to recommend suitableworkers for a human intelligence task (HIT) published by a requester. A suitable worker is the one who has a high probability of submitting a correct answer for the published HIT. However, there are four problems that make the existing methods be less effective in recommending suitable workers. First, on most of crowdsourcing platforms, the great majority of workers have good reputations and thus are regarded as homogenous workers who have equal opportunities to be recommended. Secondly, dishonest workers may gain recommendations by counterfeiting good reputations and overstating personal skills. Moreover, the classical data sparsity and cold start problems co-exist in crowdsourcing environments. To effectively differentiate homogenous workers, we firstlycalculate a worker's performance in different types of HITspublished by different requesters. Aiming to improve the accuracy of predicting a worker's performance, we propose a metric which separately considers two requesters' similarities in transacting with the common workers they trust and in transacting with the common workers they distrust. Afterwards, targeting dishonest behaviours, we propose a transaction-based trust model. Targeting the data sparsity problem, we propose a new trust sub-network extraction algorithm (TSE) to discover more requesters who can provide trustworthy opinions for generating recommendations. Furthermore, we propose two strategiesfor solving the cold start problem. Finally, by incorporatingthe similarity metric, the new trust model, the new trustsub-network extraction algorithm and the new strategies, wepropose a novel trust-aware worker recommendation methodCrowdRec. The experimental results illustrate that CrowdRecsignificantly outperforms CF and three state-of-the-art trustbased recommendation methods both in terms of accuracy and coverage.},

  abstract  = {What we know is less important than our capacity to continue to learn more until e-learning appeared. While e-learning technology has matured considerably since its inception, there are still many problems that practitioners find when come to implementing e-learning. Today's knowledge society of the 21st century requires a flexible learning environment which is capable to adapt according to teaching and learning objectives, students' profiles and preferences for information and communication technologies and services. Advances in technology offer new opportunities in enhancing teaching and learning. Many advances in learning technologies are taking place throughout the world. The new technologies enable individuals to personalize the environment in which they work or learn, utilizing a range of tools to meet their interests and needs. Research community has believed that an e-learning ecosystem is the next generation e-learning but has faced challenges in optimizing resource allocations, dealing with dynamic demands on getting information and knowledge anywhere and anytime, handling rapid storage growth requirements, cost controlling and greater flexibility. Additionally, e-learning ecosystems need to improve its infrastructure, which can devote the required computation and storage resources for e-learning ecosystems. So, we need flourish, growing, up-to-date and strong infrastructure e-learning ecosystems in a productive and cost-effective way to be able to face rapidly-changing environments. In this paper, an e-learning ecosystem (ELES) which supports modern technologies is introduced and implemented. An integration between cloud computing and Web 2.0 technologies and services will be used to support the development of e-learning ecosystems; cloud computing as an adoptable technology for many of the organizations with its dynamic scalability and usage of virtualized resources as a service through the Internet. Web 2.0 brings new instruments help building dynamic- - e-learning ecosystem on the web.},

  abstract  = {We study what we call semi-defined classification, which deals with the categorization tasks where the taxonomy of the data is not well defined in advance. It is motivated by the real-world applications, where the unlabeled data may also come from some other unknown classes besides the known classes for the labeled data. Given the unlabeled data, our goal is to not only identify the instances belonging to the known classes, but also cluster the remaining data into other meaningful groups. It differs from traditional semi-supervised clustering in the sense that in semi-supervised clustering the supervision knowledge is too far from being representative of a target classification, while in semi-defined classification the labeled data may be enough to supervise the learning on the known classes. In this paper we propose the model of Double-latent-layered LDA (D-LDA for short) for this problem. Compared with LDA with only one latent variable y for word topics, D-LDA contains another latent variable z for (known and unknown) document classes. With this double latent layers consisting of y and z and the dependency between them, D-LDA directly injects the class labels into z to supervise the exploiting of word topics in y. Thus, the semi-supervised learning in D-LDA does not need the generation of pair wise constraints, which is required in most of the previous semi-supervised clustering approaches. We present the experimental results on ten different data sets for semi-defined classification. Our results are either comparable to (on one data sets), or significantly better (on the other nine data set) than the six compared methods, including the state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering methods.},

These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system.

The MediaMill Challenge divides the generic video indexing problem into a visual-only, textual- only, early fusion, late fusion, and combined analysis experiment. We provide a baseline implementation for each experiment together with baseline results. We extract image features, on global, regional, and keypoint level, which we combine with various supervised learners. A late fusion approach of visual-only analysis methods using geometric mean was our most successful run. With this run we conquer the Challenge baseline by more than 50%. Our concept detection experiments have resulted in the best score for three concepts: i.e. desert, flag us, and charts. What is more, using LSCOM annotations, our visual-only approach generalizes well to a set of 491 concept detectors. To handle such a large thesaurus in retrieval, an engine is developed which allows users to select relevant concept detectors based on interactive browsing using advanced visualizations. Similar to previous years our best interactive search runs yield top performance, ranking 2nd and 6th overall.},

Because news media sources play a key role in the formation of public opinion, their coverage also plays a major role in the dynamics of the public debates. It can be hypothesized that the public interactions of political players may be treated differently in the media based on the editorial perspective of the media sources in question and the positions that the political players occupy in the political arena. However, the question arises, how can these differences be measured? Using corpus extraction techniques, SPARQL queries, and ontology engineering, this study compares the positions that key political players occupy in discourse spaces that are modeled by two ideologically distant news media sources based on the same controversial public issue.},

  abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O(n).},

For massive graphs, subgraph queries may have enormous number of matches, and so it is inefficient to compute all matches when only top-k matches are desired. Meanwhile, parallel algorithm is urgent for the scalability of massive graph computing. In this paper, we address the challenges of top-k subgraph query in massive graph. Firstly, we present a new graph matching notion: “approximate graph simulation”. With approximate graph simulation, top-k subgraph query can be customized by appointing a weighted query graph, which provides good flexibility for different application scenarios. Secondly, we propose a parallel top-k subgraph query algorithm at the level of vertex. With such algorithm, each vertex in massive graph obtains its matching state separately without requiring global graph information. In the algorithm, we also design a filter mechanism to speed up the the computation and a aggregation mechanism to obtain top-k vertices for query focus. Using real-life datasets, we experimentally verify that our approach of parallel top-k subgraph query are efficient.},

This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of social image understanding, i.e., tag refinement, tag assignment, and image retrieval. Different from previous work, we propose a novel weakly supervised deep matrix factorization algorithm, which uncovers the latent image representations and tag representations embedded in the latent subspace by collaboratively exploring the weakly supervised tagging information, the visual structure, and the semantic structure. Due to the well-known semantic gap, the hidden representations of images are learned by a hierarchical model, which are progressively transformed from the visual feature space. It can naturally embed new images into the subspace using the learned deep architecture. The semantic and visual structures are jointly incorporated to learn a semantic subspace without overfitting the noisy, incomplete, or subjective tags. Besides, to remove the noisy or redundant visual features, a sparse model is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep architecture. Finally, a unified optimization problem with a well-defined objective function is developed to formulate the proposed problem and solved by a gradient descent procedure with curvilinear search. Extensive experiments on real-world social image databases are conducted on the tasks of image understanding: image tag refinement, assignment, and retrieval. Encouraging results are achieved with comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The content is typically user-generated and includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. A particularly intriguing type of content is user-generated annotations (tags) for content items, as these concise string descriptions allow for reasonings about the interests of the user who created the content, but also about the user who generated the annotations. This paper presents a framework to cast the different entities of such networks into a unified graph model representing the mutual relationships of users, content, and tags. It derives scoring functions for each of the entities and relations. We have performed an experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets (crawled from deli.cio.us and Flickr) where manual user assessments of the query result quality show that our unified graph framework delivers high-quality results on social networks.},

Each video item is represented as a collection of weighted attributes that represent the accompanying features. The proposed solution allows users to construct a sequence of video items by imposing global and transitional constraints. Transitional constraints deal with the similarity between successive video objects while global constraints ensure that the retrieved video attributes attain the proposed user profile. The retrieved sequence of videos is constructed by considering it as a solution to a constrained sequence retrieval problem where constraints represent user preferences. The constrained retrieval problem is then modeled as a network flow model which leads to integer program. Relaxation techniques are then used for complexity reduction. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model in constructing the playlist according to user needs.},

The location of the user is an important information item that can be associated to the existing user profile in order to provide efficient recommendations. Also, easy availability of GPS enabled devices brings a large amount of GPS trajectories representing user's mobile logs. These GPS trajectories can be used to mine interesting patterns about users. We have studied the utility and application of information extracted from user's GPS trajectory data in recommender systems. We conceive that recommendation has an intrinsic social component and therefore this work takes a perspective towards the social aspect in location based recommender systems. In this paper, we are presenting the state-of-the-art research trends, challenges and applications in the area of Location-Based Recommender Systems (LBRS).},

  abstract = {Recommender systems are gaining widespread acceptance in e-commerce applications to confront the ldquoinformation overloadrdquo problem. Providing justification to a recommendation gives credibility to a recommender system. Some recommender systems (Amazon.com, etc.) try to explain their recommendations, in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. However, their explanations are not sufficient, because they are based solely on rating or navigational data, ignoring the content data. Several systems have proposed the combination of content data with rating data to provide more accurate recommendations, but they cannot provide qualitative justifications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that attains both accurate and justifiable recommendations. We construct a feature profile for the users to reveal their favorite features. Moreover, we group users into biclusters (i.e., groups of users which exhibit highly correlated ratings on groups of items) to exploit partial matching between the preferences of the target user and each group of users. We have evaluated the quality of our justifications with an objective metric in two real data sets (Reuters and MovieLens), showing the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.},

While there has been growing interest in these systems by businesses, government agencies, and universities, there remain important open challenges that must be addressed if the potential of these social systems is to be fully realized. For example, the presence of poor quality users and users intent on manipulating the system can disrupt the quality of socially-powered information and knowledge sharing applications. In this paper, we outline the SocialTrust++ project at Texas A&M University. The overall research goal of the SocialTrust++ project is to develop, analyze, deploy, and test algorithms for building, enabling, and leveraging community-based trust in Social Information Systems. Concretely, we are developing a trustworthy community-based information platform so that each user in a Social Information System can have transparent access to the community's trust perspective to enable more effective and efficient social information access.},

To address these concerns for Java, an Eclipse plug-in named eMoose decorates method invocations whose targets have associated directives.

To this end, we propose a process for modeling the interest graph of social networks with user-generated tags in this paper. According to the processing sequence over the tag data, the modeling procedure can be divided into three sub steps: firstly, using the Two-Mode network to One-Mode network mapping approach to construct an initial interest network represented by user tags; secondly, clustering the interest network to generate a hierarchal interest model by applying an improved GN algorithm; lastly, combining the social graph and interest graph to build an interest-based matching graph. Meanwhile, this paper also briefly describes the great potential application value of the interest graph in social networks.},

Analyzing the data, one can observe that the visitor loyalty, their lengthy visits to the site and the pages they view are much higher for the site built on the principles of Web 2.0, compared to the classical sites. Likewise, we developed and implemented a collaborative tagging system that allows every registered user to publish, save and label the content with the help of tags. Therefore, this can help in building a model that not only offers customized content but also adapts the site to user needs by providing a recommendation system and aggregate collective intelligence.},

The results and findings are encouraging: firstly, they show that the microbloggers' behavior fits the exact phases of AISAS model; secondly, the “Opinion Leader”, plays a crucial role in the communicative process of information at the stage of “share”. The latter indicates that microblog marketing may cause more possibilities of products attraction to the potential consumers than the traditional modes and approaches of media marketing.

Web users search for the desired information by querying these Web databases, when the number of query results generated is large, it is very difficult for the Web user to select the most relevant information from the large result set generated. Users today, have become more and more demanding in terms of the quality of information that is provided to them while searching the Web databases. The most common solution to solve the problem involves ranking the query results returned by the Web databases. Earlier approaches have used query logs, user profiles and frequencies of database values. The problem in all of these techniques is that ranking is performed in a user and query independent manner. This paper, proposes an automated ranking of query results returned by Web databases by analyzing user, query and workload similarity. The effectiveness of this approach is discussed considering a vehicle Web database as an example.},

The paper first defines the spectrum of Knowledge Organization Systems, from unstructured with less semantics to highly structured with richer semantics. It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories.

Performing user identity mapping on multi-platform based on the behavior patterns of users is considerable for network supervision and personalization service. The existing methods focus on utilizing either text information or structure information alone. However, text information and structure information reflect different aspects of a user. An organic combination of them is beneficial to mining user behavior patterns, thus help identify users across platforms accurately. The challenging problems are the effective representation and similarity computation of the text and structure information. We propose a mapping method which integrates text and structure information. At first, the model represents user name, description, location information based on word2vec or string matching, and friend information represented as relation network is regarded as structure information. Then these information are used for similarity computation using Jaccard index or cosine similarity. After similarity computation, a linear model is adopted to get the overall similarity of user pairs to perform user mapping. Based on the proposed method, we develop a prototype system, which allows users to set and adjust the weights of different information, or set expected index. The experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model.},

To this effect, we draw upon theories of agency and artifacts to anchor the concept of remediated practices. Then, by blending concepts from the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Management Science scholarships, we establish the baseline for remediating music performance using new digital media. The above are demonstrated using a prototypical platform which enables online music ensembles to negotiate music making using computer-mediated boundary artifacts and generic cloud services.},

Topic modeling provides a powerful method for projecting text documents into topic space. In this paper, we explore an unsupervised topic modeling approach that incorporates LDA algorithm toward discovering the topics in social media content. Empirical experiments on social media datasets with 90,527 records reveal that this approach is quite effective for detecting the topic facets and extracting their dynamics over time. By analyzing the studied dataset, five main topics were discovered accurately by the presented algorithm according to the domain experts' comments. The presented model is quite general and can be applied in a wide variety of domains to automatically mining topics from the social media channels.},

In the submission to ISMIR'07, Mohamed Sordo proposed a novel model, i.e., propagation of labels, to annotate music with existing labels, by using the content-based music similarity distance. In that model, a partially annotated collection with a lot of non-labeled music was annotated at a high precision and recall. In this paper, we proposed a new model -- label probability prediction model -- and introduce it into the Sordo's work, which makes a combined model, to improve the accuracy of propagation without exploiting any other information. In addition, we also made some modifications to the original Sordo's model that could make the algorithm works better. Then we compare the result of combined model to that yielded by the original on a publicly accessible ground truth data, and find that, the new approach can reach a higher recall. Furthermore, with the same recall, our method obtains a better precision.},

  abstract  = {Recent years, collaborative filtering systems have become so much popular due to excessive developments in technology. Rooting from the machine learning, recommender systems are in the center of the knowledge engineering that are used frequently in many computer science related fields. Therefore, this paper tries to utilize time information inferred from users' ages, which is going to be employed in the recommender systems during the similarity calculation between users. Adding more parameters, in other words, inserting detailed information of the users' preferences into the calculations will stimulate the resolution of fulfilling results thanks to new criterion. Specifically, it is proposed a conversion between two particular dates which are relevant to the user's personal data. 10-year interval is considered as a transition between generations, thus generation gap between users can make sense positively or negatively in terms of the amount of gap. Additionally, for the prerequisite of being a peer, it is defined a 3-year long difference can be a boundary to say that two users can be in the same wavelength. From the inspiration of this idea, a new mathematical addition into the well-known similarity calculation is presented in this paper. Eventually, this further time detail is taken into account via inverse proportion in similarity calculation and time incorporation approach for recommender system is emphasized. All in all, proposed method is to be tested with a real valued Movie Lens-MLP dataset on the platform of MatLab.},

In this research we develop algorithms for mining user interests by integrating time decay mechanisms into topic-based user interest profiling.

The idea of the proposed approach has its basis in three assumptions: 1) exemplars should come from high-density samples; 2) exemplars should be either the components of the reduced set or their neighbors with high similarities; and 3) clusters can be diffused by surrounding both exemplars and its labeled reduced set. We theoretically analyze the proposed FEF from the perspective of the generalization performance of clustering and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on several benchmarking datasets.},

These models leverage the inherent social communities implicit in these tagging services. We compare the proposed models to two prominent probabilistic topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Pachinko Allocation) via an experimental study of the popular Delicious tagging service. We find that the proposed community-based annotation models identify more coherent implicit structures than the alternatives and are better suited to handle unseen social annotation data.},

However, these tags are often not related to the actual image content, affecting the performance of tag related applications. In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the image tags is proposed. Firstly, information entropy of the tag is defined to refine tag frequency to predict tag initial relevance. Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {A novel method to obtain hierarchical and overlapping clusters from network data – i.e., a set of nodes endowed with pairwise dissimilarities – is presented. The introduced method is hierarchical in the sense that it outputs a nested collection of groupings of the node set depending on the resolution or degree of similarity desired, and it is overlapping since it allows nodes to belong to more than one group. Our construction is rooted on the facts that a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering of a network can be equivalently represented by a finite ultrametric space and that a convex combination of ultrametrics results in a cut metric. By applying a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering method to multiple dithered versions of a given network and then convexly combining the resulting ultrametrics, we obtain a cut metric associated to the network of interest. We then show how to extract a hierarchical overlapping clustering structure from the aforementioned cut metric. Furthermore, the so-called overlapping function is presented as a tool for gaining insights about the data by identifying meaningful resolutions of the obtained hierarchical structure. Additionally, we explore hierarchical overlapping quasi-clustering methods that preserve the asymmetry of the data contained in directed networks. Finally, the presented method is illustrated via synthetic and real-world classification problems including handwritten digit classification and authorship attribution of famous plays.},

People can add Web pages to such sites as bookmarks and allow themselves as well as others to manipulate them. One of the key features of the social book marking sites is the ability of annotating a Web page when it is being bookmarked. The annotation usually contains a set of words or phrases, which are collectively known as tags, that could reveal the semantics of the annotated Web page. Efficient and effective search of Web pages can then be achieved via such tags. However, spam tags that are irrelevant to the content of Web pages often appear to deceive other users for malicious or commercial purposes. Various techniques have been devised to tackle such tag spam detection problem. Most of these techniques were able to detect a user that always annotate spam tags. However, finer levels of detection are seldom discussed. In this work, we will propose a method based on a text mining approach to discover the relations between Web pages and there tag posts. These relations are then used to compute the similarity between a Web page and its tag post to decide if it is a spam post. Preliminary experiments show that the accuracy of the post-level spam detection task is 83%.},

Recently, it has been shown that if each data class is linearly spanned by a subspace of unknown dimensions and the data are noiseless, the lowest-rank representation (LRR) of a set of test vector samples with respect to a set of training vector samples has the nature of being both dense for within-class affinities and almost zero for between-class affinities. Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the LRRC among the classifiers that is compared to.},

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},

Good representations are an important requirement for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks to be performed successfully. However, a major problem with neural networks is that training time becomes prohibitive for very large datasets and the learning algorithm can get stuck in local minima for very deep and wide network architectures. In this paper we examine 3 ways to improve feature learning for audio data using neural networks: 1.using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) instead of standard sigmoid units; 2.using a powerful regularisation technique called Dropout; 3.using Hessian-Free (HF) optimisation to improve training of sigmoid nets. We show that these methods provide significant improvements in training time and the features learnt are better than state of the art handcrafted features, with a genre classification accuracy of 83 ± 1.1% on the Tzanetakis (GTZAN) dataset. We found that the rectifier networks learnt better features than the sigmoid networks. We also demonstrate the capacity of the features to capture relevant information from audio data by applying them to genre classification on the ISMIR 2004 dataset.},

Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks. Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost.},

The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

  abstract = {Image representation learning is a fundamental problem in understanding semantics of images. However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

The common practice is to have each platform captures and maintains data related to its own users. Later the data is analyzed to produce user specific recommendations. We argue that recommendations could be enriched by considering data consolidated from multiple sources instead of limiting the analysis to data captured from a single source. Integrating data from multiple sources is analogous to watching the behavior and preferences of each user on multiple platforms instead of a limited one platform based vision. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which utilizes user specific data collected from multiple platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to make recommendations by consulting multiple social networks to produce a rich modeling of user behavior. For this purpose, we collected and anonymized a specific dataset that contains information from BlogCatalog, Twitter and Flickr web-sites. We implemented several different types of recommendation methodologies to observe their performances while using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources. The conducted experiments showed that using multiple features from multiple social networks produces a wider perspective of user behavior and preferences leading to improved recommendation outcome.},

In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

  abstract  = {Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common items which are tagged either manually or in a semiautomatic manner. However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).},

Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the best tag sequence for a given observation sequence of words. TnT performs well on known word sequences. But, the performance degrades with increase in the number of unknown words. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome this performance degradation using fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rule based model is designed to provide TnT with sufficient information about the tag of unknown words without degrading the performance of TnT. When TnT with fuzzy rule based learning encounters an unknown word, the TnT generates a set of possible tags for the given word, based on the fuzzy rules matched by the word. If the word does not match any fuzzy rule, then the model depends upon the probability distribution of the suffix. This approach guarantees that the performance of TnT will only be improved from its normal performance.},

  abstract = {An image in social media, termed a social image, exhibits characteristics different from images widely discussed in image processing. They can be described by both content and social related attributes, called social image attributes, including visual contents, users, tags, and timestamps. There are strong coupling relationships between social image attributes, which make social images not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). By analyzing the relationships among these attributes, we can better understand the semantic activities conducted on such non-IID social images, hence enabling new applications including content organization, recommendation, and social activity understanding. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to analyze the coupling relationships between social images, which involves not only intra-coupled similarity within a social image attribute, but also inter-coupled similarity between attributes, in analyzing the non-IIDness of the similarity between social images. In particular, we propose a multi-entry version of the coupled similarity metric to deal with attributes (i.e., tags) which have a many-to-one relationship with respect to images. Experimental results on a Flickr group dataset show that the proposed algorithm captures coupling relationships and therefore achieves promising results in various applications, including image clustering and tagging.},

The proposed method's performance is evaluated on real data sets obtained from a popular online bookmarking site using different performance measures for tag and resource recommendation tasks.

Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy.

  abstract = {Audio tags correspond to keywords that people use to describe different aspects of a music clip. With the explosive growth of digital music available on the Web, automatic audio tagging, which can be used to annotate unknown music or retrieve desirable music, is becoming increasingly important. This can be achieved by training a binary classifier for each tag based on the labeled music data. Our method that won the MIREX 2009 audio tagging competition is one of this kind of methods. However, since social tags are usually assigned by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation information is useful for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem and propose two solutions to solve it. The experimental results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

  abstract  = {Among cache write-through and write-back policies, write-through policy is more efficient and offers better performance in high performance microprocessors. In write-through policy, write is done synchronously both to cache and main memory. But, write-through policy causes large energy overhead due to frequent lower lever cache accesses during write operations. A new cache architecture called Tag-Bloom cache is proposed in order to reduce the power consumption. Here, a tag is attached to each way in the L2 cache. This way tag is stored in way-tag array in L1 cache. Utilizing these tags, L2 cache can be accessed as a direct mapping cache during subsequent write hits, thereby power consumption is reduced. A Bloom Filter is introduced to accurately predict the cache miss and hot/cold checks. A considerable energy saving is obtained based on SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks along with a small area overhead and no performance degradation. High-performance microprocessors now-a-days use longer addresses and hence cache tag arrays become longer. This concept of Tag-Bloom can be applied to other existing cache design techniques to achieve further power reduction.},

  abstract  = {Social image search becomes an active research field in recent years due to the rapid development in big data processing technologies. In the retrieval systems, text description/tags play a key role to bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and higher-level concepts, and so guarantee the reliable search. However, in practice manual tags are usually noisy and incomplete, resulting in a limited performance of image retrieval. To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic topic model to formalize the correlation of tags with visual features via the latent semantic topics. Our proposed approach allows us to effectively annotate and refine tags based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm for approximate inference. Moreover, we present a measuring scheme using the refined tags and extracted topics for ranking the images. The experimental results from two large benchmark datasets show that our approach provides promising accuracy.},

However write through policy incurs large power utilization, while accessing the cache at low level (L2 cache) during write operation. In existing method, way_tagged cache was used under write-through policy, it's consumed more energy. A new cache architecture has a partial tag enhanced-bloom filter is used to improve the accuracy of cache miss prediction. By maintaining the wag tag of L2 cache in the L1 cache during read operation. The proposed technique enables L2 cache to work in direct mapping manner during write hit and reducing tag comparison of cache miss prediction, if cache miss is predicted there is no need to access the L2 cache. So that significant portion of energy will be reduced, without performance degradation. Simulation results are obtained both L1 and L2 cache configuration. The proposed technique achieves 63% energy saving in L2 cache on average with only 0.02% area overhead and no performance degradation, when compare with existing methods.},

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a “query and ranking” manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.},

We introduce in this paper a novel image retrieval framework based on a new class of kernels referred to as “network-dependent”. The main contribution of our method includes (i) a variational framework which helps designing a kernel using both the intrinsic image features and the underlying contextual informations resulting from different (e.g. social) links and (ii) the proof of convergence of the kernel to a fixed-point, that is positive definite and thus associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Experiments conducted on different ground truths, including the ImageClef/Flickr set, show the outperformance and the substantial gain of our ranking kernel with respect to the use of classic “network-free” kernels.},

We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively. Moreover, averaging over StackOverflow and Freecode results, we improve TagRec proposed by Al-Kofahi et al. by 22.65% and 14.95%, and the tag recommendation method proposed by Zangerle et al. by 18.5% and 7.35% for recall@5 and recall@10 scores.},

We describe a method that maps such entity (e.g. user or item) attributes to the latent features of a matrix (or higher-dimensional) factorization model. With such mappings, the factors of a MF model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy. We use the mapping concept to construct an attribute-aware matrix factorization model for item recommendation from implicit, positive-only feedback. Experiments on the new-item problem show that this approach provides good predictive accuracy, while the prediction time only grows by a constant factor.},

Next, we make use of the distributed word representations learned to train a deep feed forward neural network. We test our deep neural network by recommending hashtags for tweets with user-assigned hashtags, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the objective function. We also test our deep neural network by recommending hashtags for tweets without user-assigned hashtags. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach recommends hashtags that are specific to the semantics of the tweets and that preserve the linguistic regularity of the tweets.

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of social image tagging using practical vocabulary for mobile users on the social media. On the social media, images usually have an incomplete or noisy set of social tags provided by the mobile users, and we consider this issue as defective tag assignments. Previous studies on social image tagging have mostly focused on multi-label classification without considering the defective tags. In these studies, the usage of multi-label classification techniques is expected to synergically exploit the linear relations between the image features and the semantic tags. However, these approaches usually aimed to capture the linear relations from the training data while ignoring the helpful information from the test data. In addition, they failed to incorporate the non-linear associations residing in the visual features as well as in the semantic tags. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel approach based on non-linear matrix completion for image tagging task with defective tags. Specifically, we first construct the entire feature-tag matrix based on the visual features with non-linear kernel mapping. Then, we present a formal methodology together with an optimization method under the matrix completion framework to jointly complete the tags of training and test images. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method shows promising results on image tagging task on two benchmark social image datasets with defective tags, and establishes a baseline for such models in this research domain.},

Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes. Our contribution is to demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive method for generating sub-class representations has the ability to improve classification results in the case of tag classes that are visually highly heterogenous.

This paper aims to automatically annotate audio clips with tags and retrieve relevant clips from a music database by tags. Given an audio clip, we divide it into several homogeneous segments by using an audio novelty curve, and then extract audio features from each segment with respect to various musical information, such as dynamics, rhythm, timbre, pitch, and tonality. The features in frame-based feature vector sequence format are further represented by their mean and standard deviation such that they can be combined with other segment-based features to form a fixed-dimensional feature vector for a segment. We train an ensemble classifier, which consists of SVM and AdaBoost classifiers, for each tag. For the audio annotation task, the individual classifier outputs are transformed into calibrated probability scores such that probability ensemble can be employed. For the audio retrieval task, we propose using ranking ensemble. We participated in the MIREX 2009 audio tag classification task and our system was ranked first in terms of F-measure and the area under the ROC curve given a tag.},

We propose a venue recommendation algorithm: socially aware recommendation of venues and environments (SARVE). SARVE computes correlation and social characteristic information of conference participants. In order to model a recommendation process using distributed community detection, SARVE further integrates the current context of both the smart conference community and participants. SARVE recommends presentation sessions that may be of high interest to each participant. We evaluate SARVE using a real-world dataset. In our experiments, we compare SARVE with two related state-of-the-art methods, namely context-aware mobile recommendation services and conference navigator (recommender) model. Our experimental results show that in terms of the utilized evaluation metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and f-measure, SARVE achieves more reliable and favorable social (relations and context) recommendation results.},

Tagging of Web Services at finer levels of granularity can assist in drawing more detailed conclusions, making their use easier. In this paper, we go beyond global Web Service tagging by proposing a classification technique for the annotation of Web Service sections. The process focuses on port type, operation and message sections of the service description. Service information as offered through WSDL and the provider and user descriptions is considered.

Mean, variance, minimum, and maximum values of the timbre features are calculated. Modulation spectral flatness, crest, contrast, and valley are estimated for both original spectra and timbre-feature vectors. A support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier where an elaborated kernel function is defined. To reduce the computational complexity, an SVM ranker is applied for feature selection.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

Further, in order to predict tags from queries and web documents, a tag prediction algorithm named as CTAG is proposed, which could concern tags from different levels, and performs much better than the baseline method like AutoTag.},

To handle these problems, we use a co-regularization approach to learn a pair of classifiers on sound and text. The first classifier maps low-level audio features to a true tag list. The second classifier maps actively corrupted tags to the true tags, reducing incorrect mappings caused by low-level acoustic variations in the first classifier, and to augment the tags with additional relevant tags. Training the classifiers is implemented using marginal co-regularization, pair of which draws the two classifiers into agreement by a joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on two sound datasets, Freefield1010 and Task4 of DCASE2016.

In this paper, we present an intelligent music player called the Playing with Tagging (PWT) music player. By integrating a real-time music tagger, the PWT player can display dynamic tag distributions via a set of tag bars that move in sync with the music. To synchronize the tag distributions, the music tagger must be able to online recognize the music tags. We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played. To evaluate the real-time tagging function, we simulate tag prediction on short music chunks.

  abstract  = {Bloom Filters are a technique to reduce the effects of conflicts/interference in hash table-like structures. Conventional hash tables store information in a single location which is susceptible to destructive interference through hash conflicts. A Bloom Filter uses multiple hash functions to store information in several locations, and recombines the information through some voting mechanism. Many microarchitectural predictors use simple single-index hash tables to make binary 0/1 predictions, and Bloom Filters help improve predictor accuracy. However, implementing a true Bloom Filter requires k hash functions, which in turn implies a k-ported hash table, or k sequential accesses. Unfortunately,the area of a hardware table increases quadratically with the port count, increasing costs of area, latency and power consumption. We propose a simple but elegant modification to the Bloom Filter algorithm that uses banking combined with special hash functions that guarantee all hash indexes fall into non-conflicting banks. We evaluate several applications of our Banked Bloom Filter (BBF) prediction in processors: BBF branch prediction, BBF load hit/miss prediction, and BBF last-tag prediction. We show that BBF predictors can provide accurate predictions with substantially less cost than previous techniques.},

This sheds lights onto a wide variety of potential applications related to action recognition. The accurate estimation of human poses from the depth image is universally a critical step. However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when facing severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within a specific human action domain. Furthermore, as an extension, we learn a conditional model by incorporation of pose tags to further increase the accuracy of pose correction. In the experiments, significant improvements on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction are observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system. Our experiments for the facial landmark correction also illustrate that our algorithm can improve the accuracy of other detection/estimation systems.},

To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation.

The automatic tagging task is currently associated with many challenges ranging from inaccuracy of retrieval technique to the efficiency and speed of the tagging approaches.

Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the number of digital images has increased so that the management of this volume of data needs an efficient system for browsing, categorising and searching. Automatic image annotation is designed for assigning tags to images for more accurate retrieval. Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image annotation applications.},

  abstract  = {Automatic image annotation has been an important research topic in facilitating large scale image management and retrieval. Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.},

We then present an intelligent approach to support group activity preparation, including a heuristic rule-based mechanism for advertising public activity and a context-based method for private group formation. In addition, we leverage features extracted from both online and offline communities to recommend ongoing events to attendees with different needs. Compared with the baseline method, people preferred public activities suggested by our heuristic rule-based method. Using a dataset collected from 45 participants, we found that the context-based approach for private group formation can attain a precision and recall of over 80%, and the usage of spatial-temporal contexts and group computing can have more than a 30% performance improvement over considering the interaction frequency between a user and related groups. A case study revealed that, by extracting the features such as dynamic intimacy and static intimacy, our cross-community approach for ongoing event recommendation can meet different user needs.},

For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

  abstract = {Due to the unprecedented growth of unedited videos, finding highlights relevant to a text query in a set of unedited videos has become increasingly important. We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) “viralets”, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including users’ comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.). 1

Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.

We first determine relevant and irrelevant images based on label information and construct relevant and irrelevant graphs by focusing on the visually similar relevant and irrelevant images. A linear feature transformation matrix is derived by considering the two graphs. The transformation can map the images to a low-dimensional subspace in which neighborhood relevant images are pulled closer while irrelevant images are pushed away. Thus the new feature after dimensionality reduction is quite fit for KNN-based image annotation. Experiments on the Corel dataset also demonstrate the effectiveness of our dimensionality reduction method for KNN-based image annotation.},

Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been established as a powerful class of models for image recognition problems. Encouraged by these results, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of CNNs on large-scale video classification using a new dataset of 1 million YouTube videos belonging to 487 classes. We study multiple approaches for extending the connectivity of a CNN in time domain to take advantage of local spatio-temporal information and suggest a multiresolution, foveated architecture as a promising way of speeding up the training. Our best spatio-temporal networks display significant performance improvements compared to strong feature-based baselines (55.3% to 63.9%), but only a surprisingly modest improvement compared to single-frame models (59.3% to 60.9%). We further study the generalization performance of our best model by retraining the top layers on the UCF-101 Action Recognition dataset and observe significant performance improvements compared to the UCF-101 baseline model (63.3% up from 43.9%).},

Another assumption about user generated tags is that the order of these tags provides no useful information for the prediction of tags on future images. We challenge the aforementioned assumptions, and provide a machine learning approach to the problem of personalized image tagging with the following contributions: 1.) We reformulate the personalized image tagging problem as a search/retrieval ranking problem, 2.) We leverage the order of tags, which does not always reflect visual relevance, provided by the user in the past as a cue to their tag preferences, similar to click data, 3.) We propose a technique to augment sparse user tag data (semi-supervision), and 4.) We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a subset of Flickr images, showing improvement over our previous methods.},

  abstract  = {Pointwise label and pairwise label are both widely used in computer vision tasks. For example, supervised image classification and annotation approaches use pointwise label, while attribute-based image relative learning often adopts pairwise labels. These two types of labels are often considered independently and most existing efforts utilize them separately. However, pointwise labels in image classification and tag annotation are inherently related to the pairwise labels. For example, an image labeled with "coast" and annotated with "beach, sea, sand, sky" is more likely to have a higher ranking score in terms of the attribute "open", while "men shoes" ranked highly on the attribute "formal" are likely to be annotated with "leather, lace up" than "buckle, fabric". The existence of potential relations between pointwise labels and pairwise labels motivates us to fuse them together for jointly addressing related vision tasks. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between class labels, tags and attributes, and propose a novel framework PPP(Pointwise and Pairwise image label Prediction), which is based on overlapped group structure extracted from the pointwise-pairwise-label bipartite graph. With experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance on three vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Competitive results were obtained by the 5-way classifier system, obtaining F1 scores ranging from 0.59 to 0.76.

The starting point is to represent each music recording by its auditory temporal modulations. Then, an irregular third order tensor is formed. The first slice contains the vectorized training temporal modulations, while the second slice contains the corresponding multi-label vectors. The PARAFAC2 is employed to effectively harness the multi-label information for dimensionality reduction. Any vectorized test auditory representation of temporal modulations is first projected onto the semantic space derived via the PARAFAC2 and the coefficient vector is obtained. Then, the annotation vector is obtained by multiplying this coefficient vector by the left singular vectors of the second slice (i.e., the slice associated to the label vector). The proposed framework, outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 10-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

  abstract  = {In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

  abstract  = {A novel multi-label annotation method is proposed and applied to music tagging. Each music recording is represented by its auditory temporal modulations (ATMs). Given a set of training music recordings represented by the tag-music recording matrix having zero-one (indicator) vectors of the tags associated with each recording in its columns along with the matrix of the ATM representations in its columns, a low-rank weight matrix is sought, such that the tag-music recording matrix is expressed as the product of the weight matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations plus an error matrix. Clearly, such a weight matrix captures the relationships between the labels (i.e., tags) and the audio features. It can be derived by solving a convex nuclear norm minimization problem, if the tag-music recording matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations are assumed to be jointly low-rank. Having found the weight matrix, the annotation vector for labeling any test music recording can be obtained by multiplying the weight matrix with its ATM representation. The just outlined method is referred to as low-rank representation based multi-label annotation (LRRMA). The LRRMA outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Therefore we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. To make our model more suitable for nonlinear separable features, we also extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Moreover, we also integrate our multi-layer group sparse coding with kNN strategy, which greatly improves the computational efficiency.

  abstract  = {Automatic tagging of music has mostly been treated as a classification problem. In this framework, the association of a tag to a song is characterized in a “hard” fashion: the tag is either relevant or not. Yet, the relevance of a tag to a song is not always evident. Indeed, during the ground-truth annotation process, several annotators may express doubts, or disagree with each other. In this paper, we propose to fuse annotators' decisions in a way to keep information about this uncertainty. This fusion provides us continuous scores, that are used for training a regressive boosting algorithm. Our experiments show that regression with this soft ground truth leads to a more accurate learning, and better predictions, compared to traditionally used binary classification.},

  abstract  = {Automatic image annotation has drawn much attention in the last two decades due to its application in social images organization. Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Tags are semantic keywords that are assigned to an image. Image tagging enables the users of social media sharing platforms to annotate images, facilitating image search and content description. Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes. Experiments on a dataset crawled from Flickr demonstrate F1 at 10 top ranked tags equal to 0.558 for image tagging and cumulative geotagging prediction rate at 3 top ranks equal to 83%.},

  abstract  = {The availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. This paper discusses about an approach for automatic annotation in digital images. Some of the previous models for automatic image annotations are translation model (TM), continuous-space relevance model (CRM) and multiple Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM).These models have some semantic gap problems. To avoid these problems here developed a hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which is used to combine both low-level image features and user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based on the low-level image features. Low-level features are color, texture and shape. For images with user provided tags, HPM use both the image features and the tags to recommend additional tags to label the images. Here a Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) is used to capture both color and texture information. An L1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The kernel density estimation is accelerated by an Improved Fast Gauss transform(IFGT).When the number of images becomes larger then Tag-Image Association Matrix (TIAM) used in the HPM framework become very sparse, thus it is very difficult to estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. So a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for tackling this data sparsity issue. Here a CF algorithm is used to find the correlation between the words. Building such a HPM will make image labelling more efficient and less labour intensive.},

Typically, data-dependent branches are associated with program data structures, and follow store-load-branch execution sequence. A set of memory locations is written at an earlier point in a program. Later, these locations are read, and used for evaluating branch condition. Branch outcome depends on data values stored in data structure, which, typically do not have repeatable pattern. Therefore, in addition to history-based dynamic predictor, we need a different kind of predictor for handling such branches. This paper presents Store-Load-Branch (SLB) predictor; a compiler-assisted dynamic branch prediction scheme for data-dependent direct and indirect branches. For every data-dependent branch, compiler identifies store instructions that modify the data structure associated with the branch. Marked store instructions are dynamically tracked, and stored values are used for computing branch flags ahead of time. Branch flags are buffered, and later used for making predictions. On average, compared to standalone TAGE predictor, combined TAGE+SLB predictor reduces branch MPKI by 21% and 51% for SPECINT and EEMBC benchmark suites respectively.},

This paper presents FlierMeet, a crowd-powered sensing system for cross-space public information reposting, tagging, and sharing. The tags learned are useful for flier sharing and preferred information retrieval and suggestion. Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts. To evaluate our system, 38 participants were recruited and 2,035 reposts were captured during an eight-week period. Experiments on this dataset showed that our approach to flier grouping is effective and the proposed features are useful for flier category/semantic tagging.},

  abstract  = {An important aspect when sharing images in social networks is the tags the images are annotated with. Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

For solving the problem of hacking and improving the accuracy, trust-based CF methods have been proposed previously. These methods focused on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, most existing approaches use trust as a factor independent from time which we think that trust value between users is dynamic; hence it change over time. For this reason, we used friendship time and proposed a novel temporal-trust based approach called AgeTrust to measure trust value. To validate the proposed approach, we used Delicious data set and compared our approach with two other traditional trust-based approaches: traditional CF and FriendshipTrust.

  abstract  = {Concept labeling and ontology-free tagging are the two typical manners of image annotation. Despite extensive research efforts have been dedicated to labeling, currently automatic image labeling algorithms are still far from satisfactory, and meanwhile manual labeling is rather labor-intensive. In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity. Experiments are conducted on different datasets and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Traditional studies on prior knowledge generation during learning have focused on extracting sentences from reading materials that are manually generated by website administrators and educators. From the reports of previous studies, tag-based recommendation and assessment has been recognized as being an effective approach that can assist learners in finding out the clues and concepts of articles, such that it enables learners to be familiar with the learning content. However, sparse noisy data influences the quality of recommendations, especially for tag choices that are not mapped to the features of both the users and content. To cope with these problems, we adopt a hybrid recommendation method to consider tag preference, tag relevance and social networking. The experimental results show that the approach benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge, and can be an effective and efficient mechanism for enhancing the quality of prior knowledge recommendation.},

Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

However, obtaining the proper relationship among user, resource and tag is still a challenge in social annotation based recommendation researches. In this paper, we utilize the relationship from between tags and resources and between tags and users to extract group information. With the help of such relationship, we can obtain the Topic-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and resources, and Interest-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and users. The preliminary experiments have been conducted on Movie Lens dataset to compare our proposed approach with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation approach approach in terms of precision, and the result demonstrates that our approach could considerably improve the performance of recommendations.},

Most word representations are learned from large amounts of documents ignoring other information. This is rather suboptimal because the side information of the documents, such as document labels, is not used in learning word representations. In this paper, we focus on how to exploit these side information to improve word representations. We propose to incorporate document labels into the learning process of word representations in two frameworks: neural network and matrix factorization. The experimental results on word analogy and word similarity task show that our models can better capture the semantic and syntactic information than the original models. Our models also improve the performance of word representations on text classification task.},

The main goal of tweets classification and linking is to integrate all tweets that are related semantically in one place on the Web. The data inequality problems exist because authors post tweets and hashtag them based on their own preference. The authors can post tweets in different languages (English-Arabic). Therefore, the hashtags cannot be the only trackback function of the tweet to link it with the related tweets. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop an automated tweet classifier which is not limited by the language or the category of the tweet. The approach can create new suggested multilingual (English, Arabic) hashtags from tweet's content and comments "auto-tagging" in social linked open data (LOD), matching the tweets in the same topic and provides high accuracy and performance using blocking and indexing techniques. The proposed framework has substantial improvements in tweets classification and linking compared to state of the art framework of classifying and linking techniques with better classifying rate which reach 95% in precision and 97% in recall.},

We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

Unlike previous models used for tag recommendation task, our model needs neither seed tags for source texts nor a complete tag set. It can recommend new tags out of the historical tag set. We evaluate our methods on 10,265 Chinese dialogues. Experimental results show our method outperform previous models like TextRank, TFIDF rank and KNN.},

Finding the leading objects has become an important topic. These research topics are always centered around finding the most popular pages or experts. In this paper, we propose a new notion of expertise, which we call user insight. User insight denotes the user's expertise in finding Web pages that are useful or have the potential to be popular pages before other users find them. To address the issue, we refer to three major types of Web pages, namely, isolated, well-known, and burgeoning. Burgeoning pages are exceptionally useful and attractive for users in a folksonomy system. In our paper, we build a time-based algorithm to estimate user insight. In addition, we discuss the social relationship within fan networks, and we propose a link-based algorithm called CAIS (Community-based Annotation Insight Search) to realize the reinforcement between users, communities and pages. Finally, we design several experiments to evaluate the performance of CAIS and compare it to other approaches. We prove that CAIS has a better performance for the user ranking of simulated data and real data from Delicious.},

To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

Through extensive experiments over a sample of millions of geotagged Twitter posts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the smoothing approach and validate the intuition that geo-locations have the tendency to share similar “ideas” in the formation of conceptual communities.},

This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

We present an alternative approach that facilitates the generation of the structured metadata which is useful for querying the database.

Our approach relies on the idea that humans can add the valuable metadata during creation time prompted by an interface. We can increase the quality of searching to some extent, if the documents are properly annotated. Existing probabilistic approaches have some demerits. This paper proposes an approach that uses inverted indexing scheme for effective mining of informations.

UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments.},

This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness. We introduce a generic and flexible structured document model to represent heterogeneous structured documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections. We also illustrate how the proposed model can be utilized in structured document retrieval.},

However hashtags are highly ambiguous. Posts with the same hashtags are not always on the same topic. Moreover, hashtags are evolving, especially those related to illicit drugs. New street names are introduced constantly to avoid detection. In this paper, we employ topic modeling to disambiguate hashtags and track the changes of hashtags using semantic word embedding. Our preliminary evaluation shows the promise of these methods.},

The arguments against manual indexing are that it is slow, expensive, not detailed enough, that it does not lead to better retrieval, that it is outdated and document centred and that there is no consistency between indexers. The arguments against automatic indexing are that it does not provide an overview of the index terms, that it does not solve the problem of synonyms and variants, that it does not take the context into account, that it does not allow browsing related terms, that orthography may be an impediment and, finally, that it is too complex for computers. The end of the chapter gives an overview of the six most popular misconceptions about automatic indexing. },

These networking spaces generally emerged from desktop applications for organizing bibliographic references to social networking environments setup to share and tag citations for scholars. Two of the most important reference management tools, Mendeley and Zotero, are described in detail. Mendeley has the largest bibliographic database where users can read and tag the publications that other members share in the public catalogue. However, its networking functionalities are hardly exploited at all, which casts serious doubts on its future as a social networking platform. Zotero, on the other hand, is a local, reduced platform occupied above all by American users from the Humanities and Social Sciences. Nevertheless, the great limitation of this platform is that it does not have a public catalogue of the references added to the service, which impedes the sharing of references between members. As a result of this users employ groups as the means to achieve collaboration. },

This chapter highlights the research on search tactics and information-seeking strategies as applied in the digital libraries. At the same time, usage patterns, in particular log analysis of digital library usage, are presented and compared to data generated from other types of digital environments. While users take leading roles in applying some search tactics, systems play dominant roles in other tactics. User engagement and system support for different types of search tactics in the search process are illustrated. Moreover, factors influencing digital library use are analyzed, including users’ personal infrastructure, types of tasks, and system design. },

A Web Service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network, and Web Services are becoming a popular way for digital libraries to supply their content to other systems and interfaces that are designed to satisfy particular user needs. The Z39.50 standard defines a wide-ranging protocol for information retrieval between a client and a database server. The Z39.50 protocol is divided into eleven logical sections called facilities that each provides a broad set of services. A particular Z39.50 system need not implement all parts of the protocol. Indeed, the protocol is so complex that full implementation is a daunting undertaking and may in any case be inappropriate for a particular digital library site. The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was motivated by the electronic preprint community, which has a strong desire to increase the availability of scholarly repositories and to enhance access to them. OAI-PMH imposes no requirements on how metadata is represented on the server of a data provider. The metadata can be stored in a database, as simple \{XML\} files, or even embedded within other documents. },

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary E-discovery is a broad and encompassing topic. The enhancements, improvements, and other changes in corporate best practices are emerging on a near daily basis. Major areas where corporations are looking at e-discovery and changes to its landscape include: focus on litigation preparedness, emergence of better enterprise searches, centralization of e-discovery activities and actions, insourcing the e-discovery review process, emergence of folksonomies, record accessibility and retention policies, centralization of e-discovery activities and actions, and complications from “e-discovery trolls.” In corporations worldwide, but especially in the United States, there is an increased focus on being prepared to respond to and vigorously defend matters surrounding pending litigation. Particularly with regard to the recently amended Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and the new requirements in e-discovery, counsel and companies are paying new attention to both how to avoid and how to respond to lawsuits. New enterprise search platform features are emerging to integrate with litigation support software to help corporations get their arms around their data. These platforms are offering advances such as conceptual search, automatic categorization, and advanced algorithms. E-discovery trolls are emerging and making up a newly significant threat to firms. This really hinges on the emergence of the new \{FRCP\} code as it pertains to e-discovery. Folksonomic tagging allows users to create their own tags, which are freely chosen and not part of a strictly controlled vocabulary. This type of social tagging is sure to make e-discovery search and review efforts easier. The spiraling costs of e-discovery are prompting more corporate legal teams—the in-house counsel—to do more e-discovery work in-house. Another trend for e-discovery in the coming few years is automated review. },

These sites are the embodiment of the folksonomy philosophy because they aspire to create an information resource which rests exclusively on the participation of its users through the posting and tagging of documents, resulting in a self-organized information system. However, the evolution of each has been opposed, taking them on different courses. While CiteULike was spreading across countries and disciplines, BibSonomy headed to becoming a specialized tool for computer scientists and limited to German-speaking countries. However, at the time that CiteULike is recording a deep stagnation with the gradual slowdown of its functions, Bibsonomy survives with high activity in a small niche. This chapter describes the principal functionalities of each service and analyses quantitatively their document repository, social instruments and user profiles. },

Yet, one of the major inhibitors of this is the constant flux within the industry, driven by rapidly evolving business models, mergers and collaborations. A continued stream of new employees and external partners brings a need to not only manage the new information they generate, but to find and exploit existing company results and reports. The ability to synthesise this vast information ‘substrate’ into actionable intelligence is crucial to industry productivity. In parallel, the new ‘digital biology’ era provides yet more and more data to find, analyse and exploit. In this chapter we look at the contribution that Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) technology has made to meeting the information challenges faced by Pfizer. We describe two use-cases that highlight the flexibility of this software and the ultimate benefit to the user. },

This chapter is devoted to explication of the typical or standard approaches to capturing the knowledge base of a community. How we go about capturing this knowledge base, specifically, is what constitutes our domain analytical methodology. A methodology is a plan for research that quite specifically lays out which tools will be used and why. Operational parameters for domain analytic research require that the context is in the first instance a unit of analysis for the construction of a knowledge organization system. Whether it is our intent immediately to construct such a system or to leave it for others in subsequent work, our purpose in unraveling the extension and intension of a domain is to ascertain the concepts and their characteristics that constitute the functional knowledge base of the community under consideration. The second consideration is that a domain is a group. Methodologically then, the unit of analysis must be, in some way, a visible functional group. The remaining aspects of a domain that can be extracted by analysis are an ontological base that reveals an underlying teleology; a set of common hypotheses; an epistemological consensus on methodological approaches; and, social semantics. Any or all of the empirical methods described in Chapter 4, such as term extraction, thematic analysis, and visualization of author cocitation clusters should point to these aspects of domain coherence. },

  abstract  = {Abstract Organizational dynamics are vital to digital curation, as the organization becomes a social, political, and intellectual context at various levels of collaboration. The extent of humanities and digital humanities scholarship at academic institutions translates into support for archives and special collections, as Digital Humanities faculty and students will, at different stages of their projects, use digital collections at their institutions’ archives and research libraries. The extent of digital curation initiatives ranges from one department—usually a combined archives and special collections unit—to multiple units including the archives, technical services, information technologists, academic departments, and the community at large. This chapter focuses on the organizational dimensions of digital curation, placing the digital curation lifecycle in a higher education institution’s context. It will discuss at length the role of knowledge architectures and knowledge transfer in digital curation in four distinct settings: archives, academic library, institution, and community. This approach aims to demonstrate the relationship of the digital lifecycle model to curation initiatives at various levels of the institution and surround communities. },

Publisher Summary This chapter describes the resilience, which is the capability of an information space to shape and adapt itself to the different range of users, needs, and seeking strategies. To build resilient environments it is necessary to look at information architecture as a dynamic process evolving in space and time, spanning different channels, media, or environments and where people are an integral component and active players. Resilience can be augmented by tracing and tracking the interactions between people and information, places, and other people through time and by allowing them to shape or reshape the process. Two case studies illustrate the concept of resilience as it can be applied to museum design and television broadcasting. The chapter defines a synchronic society that generates trillions of catalogable, searchable, trackable trajectories: patterns of design, manufacturing, distribution, and recycling that are maintained in fine-grained detail. },

Many of the activities, which were earlier being done manually, have now been automated. Besides, a sizeable amount of information sources are now available in electronic or digital format, and Internet has become an important source of information. Not only the existing libraries and their services are now being automated, libraries of new varieties, such as digital libraries and virtual libraries are also coming up. The main areas where efforts are being made to apply computers for increasing the efficiency and speed in the field of information organization are indexing; abstracting; information retrieval tools like thesaurus, ontology, folksonomy, and folksontology; translation; and language processing. These efforts have been briefly discussed in this chapter. },

The scope and extent of curation programs vary from organization to organization and range from extensive curation initiatives at large institutions designating entire departments for digital curation to small-scale curation efforts at smaller institutions with a solo curator or none, with most curation initiatives falling between these extremes. This chapter will use the Digital Curation Centre's Lifecycle model as the framework for implementing digital curation programs from conceptualization activities to assessments. The chapter will also consider a broader conceptualization of curation; digital humanities curation and social curation play a crucial role in the construction of meanings around heritage collections, which positively impacts the usage statistics—therefore the relevance—of heritage collections. },

This framework describes the different phases associated with an evolutionary model for the introduction of new \{IT\} capabilities to an enterprise. We illustrate each phase of this framework by presenting a use-case and the key learnings from the work. },

In addition to the theoretical aspects of metadata, this chapter examines the practice of designing and implementing metadata in digital collections with a focus on developing metadata application profiles and the use of content and value standards. Furthermore, it discusses user-generated tagging and linked open data in the context of describing and sharing digital library resources. },

Libraries are adopting technological tools and approaches to closely fit library services to the lifestyles of their communities. One exemplar of such integration in the design and delivery of library services is the use of labels with deeper meanings to denote improved service models.

These requests are often challenging to satisfy, due to the disconnection between the words users employ and the attributes used in systems for image retrieval. Image collections must be supported by a robust metadata structure that can accommodate and preserve a variety of discipline-specific metadata while supporting consistent access across collections, but metadata creation is one of the most expensive components of digital projects. This chapter investigates the challenges of image description, both at the item and collection level and considerations for subject description; it also explores the practical and philosophical challenges posed by the indexing aspect of image metadata construction, summarizes current practices, and outlines the factors that influence decisions about metadata created for digital content. },

In recent years, learning methods have been superior in many applications, in which semi-supervised learning (SSL) can estimate the structure underlying both the labeled and unlabeled data. \{SSL\} is applicable to V3DOR. \{SSL\} methods can explore not only the pairwise object relevance but also the joint relevance among multiple objects. In the \{SSL\} framework, several recent works have introduced learning-based 3DOR methods. In this chapter, we briefly discuss these learning-based methods, including Hausdorff distance learning, bipartite graph optimal matching, and hypergraph learning. },

Although information architecture is not a substitute for curation or archiving, the field can effectively inform curators about the internal and extended structures of Web content requiring preservation and documentation. Curators may use structural and preservation metadata for such purposes. There is also a direct relationship between information architecture and hypertextuality, which represent several forms of hypertext in digital history projects. Understanding these forms will help curators assess the structure of large-scale projects and prepare proper documentation. This chapter focuses on the place of information architecture in digital curation where it helps curators assess the diverse structures of information spaces and the relationships of interrelated resources. },

These online applications allow for a kind of functionality and interactivity that have so far been exclusively reserved for desktop applications; they can hence be considered as a materialization of the network computer (i.e., the “NC” as opposed to the PC, the personal computer) that had first been predicted in the mid-1990s. Several \{RIAs\} are described to show their characteristics. Mash-ups, roughly implement the idea of bringing multiple services or sources of content together in one place in order to form a new, often valued-added service. One example of mash-ups is Google Maps, a service from which map information can be obtained in order to mash it up, say, with textual address information in order to make it more lively and visual. Through tagging, i.e., user-generated keywords or metadata attachable to Web resources. This allows users to attach any number of keywords to an object or a Web resource, which could be an entire Web site, a photo, or a link. This is meant to ease their storing of and searching through these objects. },

The digitization of selections from special collections, manuscripts, photographs, and other historical media has made it possible for worldwide audiences to access information about places, communities, people, and events. Social media has made it even easier for audiences to interact with the content and network with others to discuss their ancestry, inquire about places, and share information about upcoming events. This chapter focuses on implications of social networks for digital curation and addresses social curation ecosystems. Cross-curation results from the ability of social media to connect audiences across networks via automatic feeds and human-initiated actions, increasing the virality of topics, which in turn outlines a social curation ecosystem where actions in one region of the system can have varying effects elsewhere. Social networks are different in design, attracting different audiences, but connecting them across the various networks will enable curators to reach out to a wider audience. The projects at the Ward M. Canaday Center, especially Toledo's Attic, emphasizes the potential value of social media in the work of heritage institutions. },

It also describes the potential of controlled vocabularies or authoritative sources of information which can be shared, reused, and function as nodes of linked data not only by libraries but also by other communities. In the final part of the chapter the impact that the users of social networks as well as machines have on generating metadata as linked open data will be discussed. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: In this chapter, after a quick history of MIR’s principles, a series of clarifications on the state-of-the-art developments and the problems arising from such studies are presented. Some important future directions of study and research are then indicated. With regard to the usefulness of MIR’s methods, it is pointed out how research and experimentation for improving the structure and methodology of systems should always be based on the actual needs of users, and their responses to the new operational proposals. In investigating the actual functionality of \{MIR\} systems, the discussion of the limitations of the contentual objective access to documents is decisive and mathematically objective, as is the discussion of the gap between it and the conceptual-interpretive access, both internationally appointed as the semantic gap. Since the meaning of a multimedia document is rarely explicit, the goal of the system must be to provide support to overcome this gap between the simplicity of content processing offered by the machine and the rich semantic expectations of the user. A suggested solution is integrating into \{MIR\} the method of the ontologies, new guides for navigating the Semantic Web. It is about establishing a truly organic approach to multimedia search, able to take into account univocally the concrete and conceptual, the contentual and semantic representativeness of documents. Finally, accepting as a solution the use of ontologies as being compatible with MIR, to escape their rigours it is hypothetically valid to combine ontologies with folksonomies as systems for the free collaborative content categorization of documents based on labels assigned directly by end-users. The integration between the semantic tools of ontologies and folksonomies, which in turn are integrated with content-based tools, can reconcile the opposition between the principles of semantic-interpretative treatments and contentual objective treatments in the general organic tools of MIR. },

All of them have the traditional card catalog searches, as well as keyword. There is an option to refine searches to bring in a more focused, manageable set, but extensive research has shown that this option is almost never taken. This chapter shows that as the twenty-first century saw the rise of Google, the expectations of library users changed, with more patrons being dissatisfied with the classic online catalog, which they saw as containing too much library jargon. It looks at the rise of a new type of catalog that overlaid the classic catalog and delivered a more intuitive look. It had tag clouds and facets to limit the results to certain types of material or locations. Since libraries were running both types of catalogs simultaneously, it was easy to find out if they were more likely to limit a search in a discovery catalog. Several libraries reported that users were 20 times more likely to refine a search in a discovery catalog. },

We analyze this role from two perspectives: the way semantics is encoded in sentiment resources, such as lexica, corpora, and ontologies, and the way it is used by automatic systems that perform sentiment analysis on social media data. Specifically, we review and discuss state-of-the-art methods and tools that rely on semantic models and resources, possibly enabling reasoning, so as to deal with some key challenges for sentiment analysis. Examples of such challenges are context dependency and finer-grained sentiment detection, which can translate into the assigning of sentiment values to aspects of objects or into the design and use of a wider spectrum of affective labels, or the use of current techniques in finer-grained semantic processing.

  abstract  = {Abstract With the rapid advances in multimedia, communication, and Internet technology, today there is an ever-increasing amount of multimedia content with rich metadata tags on the Web. Of this massive multimedia data, image and video data represent major proportions and contain rich content information, which is very accessible for human observation and manipulation. Image and video datasets are also widely used in medical analysis, digital libraries, computer vision, and intelligent vehicles. Consequently, how to organize such digital media toward effective indexing and search is recognized as one of the fundamental challenges in the above fields, with a bright future in both academic and industrial research. Consequently, due to the incomplete annotations of multimedia data on the Web, there is a huge semantic gap between the image/video content and its textual/semantic description, which has been the core problem in multimedia analysis research thus far. Generally speaking, photographing operation from a real-world three-dimensional scene into a two-dimensional \{RGB\} image is an irreversible process that introduces problems in image and video content understanding, as well as visual search and recognition applications. Therefore, the representation, indexing and search techniques of image and video data has been a longstanding focus in research fields such as computer vision, multimedia analysis, and information retrieval, while serving as an emerging demand to improve the multimedia search services for big companies such as Google and Yahoo!. },

The changing forms and structures of information, its origins, the emergence of preferred and consensual information, the knowledge and ignorance of the contexts of its emergence and the experiences of abundance and scarcity of information all affect our possibilities to know things. Digital information is not restricted by the limits of physical space even though its users are still very much physical beings. It is created and made available in new forms, which have very little in common with the old representations of information. Information emerged in new environments in new ways and the information we retrieve for our daily pursuits of knowing is also filtered and channelled in new ways. A highly complex and unclear notion of relevance has become a guiding principle of the choice of information, even if we know very little of how and why we are consulting one particular piece of information instead of another. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: Semantic Web technologies have not replicated the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. The underlying problems are the inability of keywords to express the semantics of a query, and the functional possibilities and limitations of web applications. Searching for information is difficult and time intensive because of the lower efficiency of keyword-based search; results are often very different from the information seeker’s expectations/requirements. The human mind understands and processes information in multiple dimensions, thus the search method should also involve multiple facets. Facet analysis has been applied to knowledge organization in library and information science and also in artificial intelligence for the design of information retrieval systems. A simplified model to interface between users, information depositors, data repositories, and search engines could lead to the development of a tool which is understandable to both machine and human. The model would be based on the concept of facets and facetization so as to handle the conceptual aspect, and would also be translated to Semantic Web languages for comprehensibility by robots and crawlers. },

  abstract = {The system presented in this article aims to improve information access through the use of semantic annotation utilizing a non-traditional approach. Instead of applying semantic annotations to enhance the internal information access mechanisms, we use them to empower the user of an information access system through an innovative named entity-based user interface – NameSieve. NameSieve was built to support an intelligence analyst during the process of exploratory search, an advanced type of search requiring multiple iterations of retrieval interleaved with browsing and analyzing the retrieved information. The proposed approach was implemented in the NameSieve system so that the system can transparently present a summary of search results in the form of entity “clouds.” Therefore, these clouds allow the analyst to further explore the results in a novel manner, acting together as a faceted browsing interface. We ran a user study (with ten subjects) to examine the effect of NameSieve, and the study results reported in the paper demonstrate that this new way of applying semantic annotation information was actively used and was evaluated positively by the subjects. It enabled the subjects to work more productively and bring back most relevant documents.},
