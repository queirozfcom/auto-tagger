  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The new developments in the collaborative and participatory role of web emerges new knowledge structures driving the need towards Web based indicators for studying the diffusion of knowledge on Web. We present the results of an exploratory case-study investigating the tagging and citing practices for the WWW `06 conference papers. We observed two important patterns: (1) Papers which got heavily tagged in all three applications Delicious, Citeulike and Bibsonomy (average total tags > 6) generally achieved a high number of citations. We also observed that most of the tags were from 2006 and most of the citations were from 2007. This indicated that tags may hold the potential of foretelling the future volume of regenerative diffusion of research. (2) Terms appearing in tag-clouds of highly tagged papers in 2006 reappear frequently in the titles of respective citing papers in 2007. This shows that tag clouds may have the potential of forecasting the context of diffusion as well. It furthermore indicates that the users tag the papers with multiple tags according to their specific contexts of use as well as content of that knowledge artifact. Based on these patterns we propose that tags may be used as a supplementary indicator to model the diffusion of knowledge on Web.},

While using bibliometric techniques in this way is not a new idea, the proposed approach extends previous studies in a number of important ways. Firstly, instead of being purely exploratory, the focus of our research has been on developing techniques for detecting technologies that are in the early growth phase, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of relevant publications. Secondly, to increase the reliability of the forecasting effort, we propose the use of automatically generated keyword taxonomies, allowing the growth potentials of subordinate technologies to be aggregated into the overall potential of larger technology categories. A proof-of-concept implementation of each component of the framework is presented, and is used to study the domain of renewable energy technologies. Results from this analysis are presented and discussed.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

Results indicate a steady decrease in the number of unique tags over the four years, suggesting an increasing stability in the community vocabulary over time and the establishment of domain-specific vocabulary. Members reused each others' tags over time and exhibited increasingly collaborative tagging behaviour. Tag discrimination was high, with 4.11 distinct articles per tag. The stable and discriminatory nature of the community's tags suggests that collaborative tagging may serve as a useful resource for vocabulary choice or maintenance by KMS managers. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods. © 2010 ACM.},

As Twitter evolves, more and more people are partaking in sharing what is happening around the world through various Twitter applications. Hashtag use has become a unique tagging convention to help associate Twitter messages with certain events or contexts. Prefixed by a # symbol with a keyword, a Twitter hashtag serves as a bottom-up user-proposed tagging convention. It also embodies user participation in the process of hashtag innovation, especially as it pertains to information organization tasks. Diffusion of innovation (DoI) is a theory that helps to explain the adoption process of an innovation by modeling its entire life cycle according to the aspects of communications and human information interactions. Hence, diffusion theory offers valuable insights into interface design that supports Twitter hashtag use and access. It also assists in evaluating hashtag life cycles and thus offering information required for decision-making, in regard to hashtag management.},

Results of the study show that there is still a mix of consensus and divergence in tagging term use and tagging patterns. While some of the chosen URLs maintained or even increased their popularity, others experienced a severe drop in popularity. Tag usage showed some measures of influence between taggers, but users continued to use their own tags and the proportions of unique and untagged items has increased. Proportions of tags used showed fluctuations with islands of stability over a 4 year period. Patterns in the usage of tags assigned to these documents also highlighted practices related to personal and collective information organisation which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

In this paper, we present a novel method to analyze and identify correlated burst patterns by considering multiple data streams that coevolve over time. The main technical contribution of our research is the use of a dynamic probabilistic network to model the dependency structures observed within these data streams. Such dependencies provide meaningful information concerning the overall system dynamics and should be explicitly integrated into the burst detection process. Using both synthetic scenarios and two real-world datasets, we compare our method with an existing burst-detection algorithm. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach allows for more balanced and accurate burst quantification.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

Most existing approaches are performed by training independent concept detectors omitting the interdependencies between concepts. The obtained annotations are often not so satisfactory. Therefore, a process of annotation refinement is mondatory to improve the imprecise annotation results. Recently, harnessing the contextual correlation between concepts is shown to be an important resource to improve concept detection. In this paper, we propose a new context based concept detection process. For this purpose, we define a new semantic measure called Second order Co-occurence Flickr context similarity (SOCFCS), which aggregates the FCS values of common Flickr related-tags of two target concepts in order to calculate their relative semantic context relatedness (SCR). Our proposed measure is applied to build a concept network as the context space. A Random Walk with Restart process is performed over this network to refine the annotation results by exploring the contextual correlation among concepts. Experimental studies are conducted on ImageCLEF 2011 Collection containing 99 concepts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract        = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the growth patterns of tag vocabulary in collaborative tagging systems to verify the sustainability and stabilization of tag distributions. Both sustainability and stabilization are essential to the mining and categorization of information driven by tagging behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on time series data of CiteULike from November 2004 to April 2010. Power law distributions were detected to reveal statistical regularities and tagging patterns. Logistic regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted to identify the factors affecting the growth of distinct tags for articles. The significance of the effects and the time taken for a given article to reach its tagging maturity were also explored. Findings - Time series plots and trend analysis illustrated the continuous growth of the tagging system. Exploratory analysis of power law distribution fittings indicated a sign of system stability known as scale invariance. Logistic regression results demonstrated that for a particular article, the number of users who tagged the article, the initial date when the article was tagged, and the life span of the article are statistically significant to the ratio of the distinct tag number to the total tag number for a given article. These results confirmed that the distinct tag ratio of an article gives rise to a stable pattern. Originality/value - Though extensive work has been done on the patterns of tag vocabulary, it is not clear how the growth of distinctive tags behaves in relation to the total number of tag applications, considering time-dependent covariates such as the number of users, and the longevity of an article. This paper sets to complement the literature on the existing methodology and investigate this property in detail. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Past work has addressed such prob- lems individually for specific applications, but has lacked a generalizable framework for performing both classification and prediction of topic usage. Our approach is to model a topic as a temporally ordered sequence of derived feature states and capture characteristic changes in the topic trend. These sequences are drawn from a dynamic segmentation of frequency data based on change point analysis. We employ Partitioning Around Medoids clustering on these segments to produce signatures which highlight characteristic patterns of usage growth and decay. We demonstrate how this signa- ture model can be used to define distinctive classes of topics in multiple online contexts, including tagging systems and web-based information retrieval. Additionally, we show how the model can predict the general trajectory of interest in a particular topic. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Users' tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing the temporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web. Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However, there exist remarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources.

This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It profiles the events with more representative and comprehensible clues. The proposed approach is divided into three stages. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events. We discuss the choice of similarity and granularity for event detection. After that, we further utilize an automatically generated tag taxonomy to organize bursty events to facilitate the burst oriented navigation and analysis.

Cloud model is used in this paper. By introducing similarity cloud properties of cloud model, cloud model can detect the unsupervised communities, describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively, and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities. For illustration, the proposed model is applied to Delicious dataset to detect unsupervised communities and one month is used as time slice to study the evolutions of the unsupervised communities. Empirical results show that the unsupervised community in social tagging in network, using Similarity cloud properties of cloud model can effectively detect different unsupervised communities, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively. Similarity cloud properties based cloud model can effectively detect unsupervised community in social tagging network, and quantitatively describe the evolutions of the community and community user' dynamic interest. Hence, CBUCD model is an efficient solution for detecting unsupervised community and analyzing evolutions.},

  abstract  = {Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media. Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (e.g., breaking events) and stable topics (e.g., user interests). Due to their different natures, it is important and useful to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However, such a discrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are very short in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporal topics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically, a unified user-temporal mixture model is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model's performance, we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information in a social network, as well as a burst-weighted smoothing scheme that exploits temporal prior information in the time dimension. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposal on two real data sets obtained from Del.icio.us and Twitter. The experimental results verify that our mixture model is able to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in a single detection process. Our mixture model enhanced with the spatial regularization and the burst-weighted smoothing scheme significantly outperforms competitor approaches, in terms of topic detection accuracy and discrimination in stable and temporal topics.},

However, the huge amount of data available, along with the breadth of the user base, requires a substantial effort of information filtering to successfully drill down to relevant topics and events. Trending topic detection is therefore a fundamental building block to monitor and summarize information originating from social sources. There are a wide variety of methods and variables and they greatly affect the quality of results. We compare six topic detection methods on three Twitter datasets related to major events, which differ in their time scale and topic churn rate. We observe how the nature of the event considered, the volume of activity over time, the sampling procedure and the pre-processing of the data all greatly affect the quality of detected topics, which also depends on the type of detection method used. We find that standard natural language processing techniques can perform well for social streams on very focused topics, but novel techniques designed to mine the temporal distribution of concepts are needed to handle more heterogeneous streams containing multiple stories evolving in parallel. One of the novel topic detection methods we propose, based on -grams cooccurrence and topic ranking, consistently achieves the best performance across all these conditions, thus being more reliable than other state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.},

Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects. Be- cause our perceptions in each specific area of knowledge is evolving over time, the goal of our approach is also to evolve the represented knowledge in semantic tagging systems dy- namically according to the latest perception of the related users. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process.

Term Frequency and Proportional Document Frequency (TF*PDF) is employed as a means to detect hot topics from patents, and IPCs are used to calculate semantic importance of terms based on the IPCs where terms are distributed. Aging Theory is also used to calculate the variation of trends over time. Four types of trends including very stable trends, stable trends, normal trends, and unstable trends are defined and evaluated based on TF*PDF and TF*PDF combined with Aging Theory. Experiment results show that for very stable trends, the combination of TF*PDF and Aging Theory achieves 0.976% in Precision; for stable trends and all trends, TF*PDF achieves 0.959% and 0.84% in Precision, respectively. By applying TF*PDF in consideration of semantic information, we also show a new criteria for weighting hot topics and technology trend tracking.},

Consumers who significantly influence the opinions and decisions of others through communicative acts are called opinion leaders.

Since opinion leaders have different expertise and interests, they are typically topic sensitive.

In Stage I, we derive opinion leaders' interest from their tags. In Stage II, we rank leaders according to not only the link structure of networks but also opinion leaders' personal expertise and interests.

  abstract  = {Currently Internet usage has increased a lot due to bandwidth availaility and technology advancements. Internet is widely used for knowledge sharing, online review of products etc. Many open forums, blogs are used for this purpose. Since many users are contributing their opinions towards any query submitted by information seeker, there is a possibility of confusion. Often opinions contradict with each other creating confusion in information seeker's mind. In these cases role of Opinion Leader(s) is very prominent. Opinion Leader is a person who has knowledge in the particular field, who's opinion makes difference and who can influence other's opinions. Identification of a person who has great experiences and/or knowledge, in a particular domain, is very helpful and useful in decision making, product marketing etc. This paper presents an approach for identification of Opinion Leader(s) using modified SPEAR (Spamming Resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking) algorithm. The expertise of user is found out on different topics. Modified SPEAR algorithm effectively identifies Opinion Leader(s) by making use of additional influence measures in the form of credit score functions. It also analyses these measures and studies their effects while ranking the Opinion Leader(s) effectively.},

  abstract        = {What makes a song to a chart hit? Many people are trying to find the answer to this question. Previous attempts to identify hit songs have mostly focused on the intrinsic characteristics of the songs, such as lyrics and audio features. As social networks become more and more popular and some specialize on certain topics, information about users' music tastes becomes available and easy to exploit. In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

Unlike expert-maintained taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, tags evolve organically based on the collective action of individual users. The collection of tags in a tagging system, called a folksonomy, can vary widely from site to site. The paper mentions that the combination of eager taggers and intelligent algorithms that nurture effective tagging behavior promises a bright future for tagging systems.},

  abstract  = {Online social networking sites such as Flickr and Facebook provide a diverse range of functionalities that foster online communities to create and share media content. In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

  abstract  = {On Stack Overflow, more than 38,000 diverse tags are used to classify posts. The Stack Overflow community provides tag synonyms to reduce the number of tags that have the same or similar meaning. In our previous research, we used those synonym pairs to derive a number of strategies to create tag synonyms automatically. In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities. We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},
