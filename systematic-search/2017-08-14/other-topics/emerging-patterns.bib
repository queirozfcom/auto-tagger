  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The new developments in the collaborative and participatory role of web emerges new knowledge structures driving the need towards Web based indicators for studying the diffusion of knowledge on Web. We present the results of an exploratory case-study investigating the tagging and citing practices for the WWW `06 conference papers. We observed two important patterns: (1) Papers which got heavily tagged in all three applications Delicious, Citeulike and Bibsonomy (average total tags > 6) generally achieved a high number of citations. We also observed that most of the tags were from 2006 and most of the citations were from 2007. This indicated that tags may hold the potential of foretelling the future volume of regenerative diffusion of research. (2) Terms appearing in tag-clouds of highly tagged papers in 2006 reappear frequently in the titles of respective citing papers in 2007. This shows that tag clouds may have the potential of forecasting the context of diffusion as well. It furthermore indicates that the users tag the papers with multiple tags according to their specific contexts of use as well as content of that knowledge artifact. Based on these patterns we propose that tags may be used as a supplementary indicator to model the diffusion of knowledge on Web.},

While using bibliometric techniques in this way is not a new idea, the proposed approach extends previous studies in a number of important ways. Firstly, instead of being purely exploratory, the focus of our research has been on developing techniques for detecting technologies that are in the early growth phase, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of relevant publications. Secondly, to increase the reliability of the forecasting effort, we propose the use of automatically generated keyword taxonomies, allowing the growth potentials of subordinate technologies to be aggregated into the overall potential of larger technology categories. A proof-of-concept implementation of each component of the framework is presented, and is used to study the domain of renewable energy technologies. Results from this analysis are presented and discussed.},

In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

Results indicate a steady decrease in the number of unique tags over the four years, suggesting an increasing stability in the community vocabulary over time and the establishment of domain-specific vocabulary. Members reused each others' tags over time and exhibited increasingly collaborative tagging behaviour. Tag discrimination was high, with 4.11 distinct articles per tag. The stable and discriminatory nature of the community's tags suggests that collaborative tagging may serve as a useful resource for vocabulary choice or maintenance by KMS managers. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods. © 2010 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Twitter is a fast growing real-time social media tool. As Twitter evolves, more and more people are partaking in sharing what is happening around the world through various Twitter applications. Hashtag use has become a unique tagging convention to help associate Twitter messages with certain events or contexts. Prefixed by a # symbol with a keyword, a Twitter hashtag serves as a bottom-up user-proposed tagging convention. It also embodies user participation in the process of hashtag innovation, especially as it pertains to information organization tasks. Diffusion of innovation (DoI) is a theory that helps to explain the adoption process of an innovation by modeling its entire life cycle according to the aspects of communications and human information interactions. Hence, diffusion theory offers valuable insights into interface design that supports Twitter hashtag use and access. It also assists in evaluating hashtag life cycles and thus offering information required for decision-making, in regard to hashtag management.},

Results of the study show that there is still a mix of consensus and divergence in tagging term use and tagging patterns. While some of the chosen URLs maintained or even increased their popularity, others experienced a severe drop in popularity. Tag usage showed some measures of influence between taggers, but users continued to use their own tags and the proportions of unique and untagged items has increased. Proportions of tags used showed fluctuations with islands of stability over a 4 year period. Patterns in the usage of tags assigned to these documents also highlighted practices related to personal and collective information organisation which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

Based on a vast corpus of approximately 150 million bookmarks found at del. icio.us, the authors analyze bookmarking and tagging patterns and discuss evidence that social bookmarking systems are vulnerable to spamming.
