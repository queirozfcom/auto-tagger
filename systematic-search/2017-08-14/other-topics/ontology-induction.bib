One basic approach in support of such retrieval mechanisms is the generation of semantic annotation, based on ontologies describing both the field and the structure of the texts themselves. Many current approaches use statistical methods similar to the ones employed by Google to find correlations within the texts. While successful and efficient, this approach fails to take advantage of the additional information provided by the structure of the sources, or, i.e. the upper ontology used by the author. mArachna is based on natural language processing techniques, taking advantage of characteristic linguistic structures defined by the language used in mathematical texts. It creates a knowledge base from the mathematical relations presented in a text, mapping the ontology onto the structure of the knowledge base.},

An interesting outcome is that the characteristic qualities of these systems seem to be inverse to more traditional knowledge structuring approaches like taxonomies or ontologies: The latter provide rich and precise semantics, but suffer - amongst others - from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. An important step towards exploiting the possible synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy. This position paper presents preliminary results of ongoing work to induce hierarchical relationships among tags by analyzing the aggregated data of collaborative tagging systems as a basis for an ontology learning procedure.},

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including whether coherent categorization schemes can emerge from unsupervised tagging by users. This paper uses data from the social bookmarking site delicio. us to examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we examine whether the distribution of the frequency of use of tags for "popular" sites with a long history (many tags and many users) can be described by a power law distribution, often characteristic of what are considered complex systems. We produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to understand the basic dynamics behind tagging, including how a power law distribution of tags could arise. We empirically examine the tagging history of sites in order to determine how this distribution arises over time and to determine the patterns prior to a stable distribution. Lastly, by focusing on the high-frequency tags of a site where the distribution of tags is a stabilized power law, we show how tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags can be used to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags.},

This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified. ¬© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Semantic annotation of the provided information is necessary to support the user in retrieving and filtering requested information. Wide-spread tools like Google have shown both the power and the limitations of statistical methods based on correlations between terms within texts. The KEA system uses a different approach. Natural language processing techniques, taking advantage of characteristic linguistic structures defined by the language used in mathematical texts, are utilized in the automatic extraction of ontologies from mathematical texts. As a result, the system creates a base of the mathematical relations and concepts by mapping the extracted ontologies on the structure of a data base. To support the retrieval and further refinement of the data stored within this mathematical knowledge base, KEA implements a number of Web 2.0 technologies in a desktop style interface.

For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. ¬© 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

The number of these resources has increased enormously within organisations over time and with an increasing variety of quality standards, maturity and granularity of resources, the description of content with metadata becomes more and more challenging. Automatic extraction services and professional metadata authoring tools could not deliver the expected results. Therefore, this research project investigated and discussed collaborative tagging as a means to successfully tag KLR. This paper presents results of an online survey distributed to first-year Information Systems students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The results report on the study's key themes of commitment and convergence towards generally accepted collaborative tags. Commitment and convergence could be confirmed, but there is a need for further exploration with a higher number of participants. Collaborative tagging is suggested as a solution to facilitate the development of ontologies for describing organisational metadata. ¬© 2008 Ronald Maier, Silke Retzer and Stefan Thalmann.},

Conventional tags, meaning freely created tags that are not associated with a structured ontology, are not naturally suited for collaborative processes, due to linguistic and grammatical variations, as well as human typing errors. Additionally, tags reflect personal views of the world by individual users, and are not normalised for synonymy, morphology or any other mapping. Our view is that the conventional approach provides very limited semantic value for collaboration. Moreover, in cases where there is some semantic value, automatically sharing semantics via computer manipulations is extremely problematic. This paper explores these problems by discussing approaches for collaborative tagging activities at a semantic level, and presenting conceptual models for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies. We present criteria for the comparison of existing tag ontologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in relation to these criteria.},

Ontologies provide an effective means of capturing and integrating knowledge for feedback provisioning, while using collaborative activities can support pedagogical theories, such as social constructivism. Both technologies have developed separately in the e-learning domain; representing respectively a teacher-centered and a learner-centered approach for learning environments. In this paper we bridge the gap between these two approaches by leveraging the social semantic Web paradigm, and propose a collaborative semantic-rich learning environment in which folksonomies created from studentspsila collaborative tags contribute to ontology maintenance, and teacher-directed feedback.},

Our main finding is that the majority of SW schemas with a significant number of properties (respectively, classes) approximate a power law for total-degree (respectively, the number of subsumed classes) distribution. Moreover, our analysis revealed some emerging conceptual modeling practices of SW schema developers: (1) each schema has a few focal classes that have been analyzed in detail (that is, they have numerous properties and subclasses), which are further connected with focal classes defined in other schemas, (2) class subsumption hierarchies are mostly unbalanced (that is, some branches are deep and heavy, while others are shallow and light), (3) most properties have as domain/range classes that are located high at the class subsumption hierarchies, and (4) the number of recursive/multiple properties is significant. The knowledge of these features is essential for guiding synthetic SW schema generation, which is an important step toward benchmarking SW repositories and query language implementations.},

This paper considers using both minimized domain-specific ontology and generic ontology. We show how less detailed ontologies can help end users to annotate and search with the simple user interface. Our prototype system has the capability to describe the semantics for contents of an image.

Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused. In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as Semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data. ¬© 2008 IEEE.},

This paper presents an extension to the LOCO-Analyst tool, which leverages student folksonomies to support instructors when revising and updating course domain ontologies. The support is based on a computation of relatedness between ontology concepts and students tags which takes into account the "context" defined by the domain ontology. The computed scores are visualized in a tag cloud along with tag popularity scores, to allow instructors to easily comprehend the emergent feedback of their students. This approach allows for a simple and intuitive method for instructors to associate tags with concepts in their domain ontology. ¬© 2008 IEEE.},

Unfortunately, most web pages do not contain tags and, thus, no vocabulary that describes the information provided. A common problem in web page annotation is to motivate users for constant participation, i.e. tagging.

Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. ¬© 2009 Springer.},

The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. This drawback has created the need for ontological structures which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations for translating and integrating the different sources.

  abstract        = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linking of a folksonomy (user vocabulary) and LCSH (controlled vocabulary) on the basis of word matching, for the potential use of LCSH in bringing order to folksonomies. Design/methodology/approach A selected sample of a folksonomy from a popular collaborative tagging system, Delicious, was wordÓì∏matched with LCSH. LCSH was transformed into a tree structure called an LCSH tree for the matching. A close examination was conducted on the characteristics of folksonomies, the overlap of folksonomies with LCSH, and the distribution of folksonomies over the LCSH tree. Findings The experimental results showed that the total proportion of tags being matched with LC subject headings constituted approximately twoÓì∏thirds of all tags involved, with an additional 10 percent of the remaining tags having potential matches. A number of barriers for the linking as well as two areas in need of improving the matching are identified and described. Three important tag distribution patterns over the LCSH tree were identified and supported: skewedness, multifacet, and ZipfianÓì∏pattern. Research limitations/implications The results of the study can be adopted for the development of innovative methods of mapping between folksonomy and LCSH, which directly contributes to effective access and retrieval of tagged web resources and to the integration of multiple information repositories based on the two vocabularies. Practical implications The linking of controlled vocabularies can be applicable to enhance information retrieval capability within collaborative tagging systems as well as across various tagging system information depositories and bibliographic databases. Originality/value This is among frontier works that examines the potential of linking a folksonomy, extracted from a collaborative tagging system, to an authorityÓì∏maintained subject heading system. It provides exploratory data to support further advanced mapping methods for linking the two vocabularies. ¬© 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Web sites allowing resources to be tagged provide a tremendous amount of user-generated taxonomic information.

To minimize these problems, this paper suggests a user-categorized tag that freely defines the category of the tag when the user inputs it. Based on the user-categorized tags, a structured folksonomy is automatically created.

In a tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests, and taxonomy is a useful way to organize these tags. As tags change over time, it is imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two key features. Firstly, we develop a novel context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. Secondly, we propose several algorithms for evolutionary taxonomy fusion. We conduct an extensive performance study using a very large real-life dataset (i.e., Del.ici.ous). The empirical results clearly show that our approach is effective and efficient. ¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

While several methods have been proposed, little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems. A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging: Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others. In this work, we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures. We distinguish between categorizers, who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes, and describers, who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords. To study our hypothesis, we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers. Our results not only show that "verbose" taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics, but also that a subset containing only 40% of the most 'verbose' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset. Moreover, the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics. This work is relevant for designers and analysts of tagging systems interested (i) in fostering the semantic development of their platforms, (ii) in identifying users introducing "semantic noise", and (iii) in learning ontologies. ¬© 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

In the development of large and complex systems, with a huge number of uncertain stakeholders, the requirements engineering process becomes a challenging task due to overwhelming and dynamic social interactions, tradeoffs, and collective decisions made by above stakeholders. Traditional approaches and techniques are deficient in supporting this kind of social interactions in requirements-related activities, and managing the evolving requirements and their traceability caused by the social interactions. This paper proposes to address the challenges in the pre-requirements analysis of large and complex systems by employing the techniques from collective intelligence based on Web 2.0 tools and technologies, which is composed of three steps: first, obtain collective requirements knowledge through collaborative tagging by stakeholders; second, transform collaborative requirement tags into requirement ontologies; third, support collective requirement decision-making (i.e., collective intelligence) based on the requirement ontologies through requirements reasoning. ¬© 2010 ACM.},

However, information or content navigation support through taxonomy is often constrained due to its inability to take into account the full nomenclature and cultural nuances of knowledge seekers. The emergence and increasing adoption of collaborative tagging (social bookmarking) tools have provided lightweight and informal conceptual structures called folksonomies for knowledge retrieval. As for folksonomies, they reflect the vocabulary of the users. Hence, integrating folksonomies into a taxonomy combines the best of the two schemes as the resultant structure enhances taxonomy navigation with personsalisation for knowledge search and retrieval. This paper presents TaxoFolk, an algorithm for deriving hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy classification for enhanced knowledge navigation. The algorithm integrates folksonomy with a taxonomy through several unsupervised data mining techniques with augmented heuristics. ¬© 2010 Operational Research Society. All rights reserved.},

Both the tagging and the ontological models are intentionally designed to suit the multi-perspective environment. The paper develops a method based on a set of rules that determine how to associate new concepts to predefined perspectives (in addition to determining relations to topics or other concepts as typically done in previous research) and how to insert and maintain multiple perspectives. Findings - This case study experiment, with a set of selected annotated images, indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model. Originality/value - The proposed framework characterises the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development of a multi-perspective ontology and its application to improve image annotation, searching and browsing. The significance of this research is that it focuses on exploring the impact of creating a constantly evolving ontology based on collaborative tagging.

  abstract        = {Taxonomy construction is a resource-demanding, top-down, and time consuming effort. It does not always cater for the prevailing context of the captured information. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically convert tags into a hierarchical taxonomy. Folksonomy describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords or tags to shared content. Using folksonomy as a knowledge source for nominating tags, the proposed method first converts the tags into a hierarchy. This serves to harness a core set of taxonomy terms; the generated hierarchical structure facilitates users' information navigation behavior and permits personalizations. Newly acquired tags are then progressively integrated into a taxonomy in a largely automated way to complete the taxonomy creation process. Common taxonomy construction techniques are based on 3 main approaches: clustering, lexico-syntactic pattern matching, and automatic acquisition from machine-readable dictionaries. In contrast to these prevailing approaches, this paper proposes a taxonomy construction analysis based on heuristic rules and deep syntactic analysis. The proposed method requires only a relatively small corpus to create a preliminary taxonomy. The approach has been evaluated using an expert-defined taxonomy in the environmental protection domain and encouraging results were yielded. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In such spaces, users annotate resources by means of any keyword or tag that they find relevant, giving raise to lightweight conceptual structures aka folksonomies. In this respect, needless to mention that ontologies can be of benefit for enhancing information retrieval metrics. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ontology learning from a folksonomy, which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations between tags. The main thrust of the introduced approach stands in putting the focus on the discovery of nontaxonomic relationships. The latter are often neglected, even though they are of paramount importance from a semantic point of view. The discovery process heavily relies on triadic concepts to discover and select related tags and to extract and label non-taxonomically relationships between related tags and external sources for tags filtering and non-taxonomic relationships extraction. In addition, we also discuss a new approach to evaluate obtained relations in an automatic way against WordNet repository and presents promising results for a real world folksonomy.},

The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2 . Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. ¬©2010 IEEE.},

So the participants can choose the modeling option that better represents the intended model of the domain.

  abstract        = {Information representation in engineering design is currently dominated by top-down approaches such as taxonomies and ontologies. While top-down approaches provide support for computational reasoning, they are primarily limited due to their static nature, limited scope, and developer-centric focus. Bottom-up approaches, such as folksonomies, are emerging as means to address the limitations of top-down approaches. Folksonomies refer to collaborative classification by users who freely assign tags to design information. They are dynamic in nature, broad in scope, and are user focused. However, they are limited due to the presence of ambiguities and redundancies in the tags used by different people. Considering their complementary nature, the ideal approach is to use both top-down and bottom-up approaches in a synergistic manner. To facilitate this synergy, the goal in this paper is to present techniques for using dynamic folksonomies to extract global characteristics of the structure of design information, and to create hierarchies of tags that can guide the development of structured taxonomies and ontologies. The approach presented in this paper involves using (a) tools such as degree distribution and K-neighborhood connectivity analysis to extract the global characteristics of folksonomies and (b) set-based technique and hierarchical clustering to develop a hierarchy of tags. The approach is illustrated using data from a collective innovation platform that supports collaborative tagging for design information. It is shown that despite the flat nature of the folksonomies insights about the hierarchy in information can be gained. The effects of various parameters on the tag hierarchy are discussed. The approach has potential to be used synergistically with top-down approaches such as ontologies to support the next generation collaborative design platforms. ¬© 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

  abstract  = {We can observe that the amount of non-toy domain ontologies is stillvery limited for many areas of interest. In contrast, folksonomies are widely inuse for (1) tagging Web pages (e.g. del.icio.us), (2) annotating pictures (e.g.flickr), or (3) classifying scholarly publications (e.g. bibsonomy). However,such folksonomies cannot offer the expressivity of ontologies, and therespective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definitionof meaning. Also, folksonomies and other unsupervised vocabularies frequentlysuffer from inconsistencies and redundancies. In this paper, we argue that thesocial interaction manifested in folksonomies and in their usage should beexploited for building and maintaining ontologies. Then, we sketch acomprehensive approach for deriving ontologies from folksonomies byintegrating multiple resources and techniques. In detail, we suggest combining(1) the statistical analysis of folksonomies, associated usage data, and theirimplicit social networks, (2) online lexical resources like dictionaries, Wordnet,Google and Wikipedia, (3) ontologies and Semantic Web resources, (4)ontology mapping and matching approaches, and (5) functionality that helpshuman actors in achieving and maintaining consensus over ontology elementsuggestions resulting from the preceding steps.},

A folksonomy is a system of classification derived from the practice and method of collaboratively creating and managing tags. The most significant feature of a folksonomy is that it directly reflects the vocabulary of users. This feature is very useful in tag-based content searching and user browsing. Based on mutual-overlapping measurement of tag's instance sets, an ontology learning algorithm to construct concept hierarchy from folksonomy is proposed. A case study of datasets from a famous Chinese e-business website taobao is carried out. The precision, valid, recall and F-measure rates of the constructed concept hierarchy are 54%, 84%, 100% and 70% respectively. The experimental results on real world datasets show that the proposed method is feasible.},

When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.},

Nevertheless, using ontologies alone has some weaknesses due to the need of being statically modeled by a set of experts in a specific domain.

One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. ¬© 2012 ACM.},

The problem we consider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying on information-theoretic concepts, we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity, and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard, and we propose a greedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is equipped with strategies for pruning the search space deriving directly from the objective function. We also prove a property that allows assessing the level of informativeness for newly added dimensions, thus allowing to define criteria for terminating the decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets with known dimension and three real-world datasets, flickr, del. icio. us and dblp. The problem we study is largely motivated by applications in the domain of collaborative tagging; however, the mining task we introduce in this paper is useful in other application domains as well. ¬© 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i. e., Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This phenomenon is fostering initiatives to improve the semantic interpretation of tags, usually involving two main entities: "social ontologies", which emerges from the collaborative tagging (folksonomies), and formal ontologies. In order to analyze and compare these initiatives we present here an abstract framework. It supports our argument that existing approaches do not explore the full potential of the combination between folksonomies and ontologies due to their unidirectionality. The framework is also the basis to evidence that a fusion approach - -as proposed in our "folksonomized ontology" - -enables to better explore the organic semantics of folksonomies combined to the engineered semantics of ontologies. ¬© 2012 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Due to the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, the research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other related concepts is becoming an important interdisciplinary area with great potential and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely 'flat', while in some cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags. However, usually no overall hierarchical organization of the tags is given, and one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there are also other types of tagged networks available for research, where the tags are already organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the 'is a sub-category of' type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper, we study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes marked by the tags in various real networks. The motivation for this research was the fact that understanding the tagging based on a known hierarchy can help in revealing the hidden hierarchy of tags in collaborative tagging systems.We analyse the relation between the tagfrequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG (i.e. their rank or significance as characterized by, e.g., the length of the branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features of tag co-occurrence. This model has high potential for further practical applications, e.g., it can provide the starting point for a benchmark system in ontology retrieval or it may help pinpoint unusual correlations in the co-occurrence of tags. ¬© IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good. ¬© 2012 IEEE.},

The usual largeness of these collections requires a vast endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually. As an approach to effectively produce an automated classification of resources, we consider the immense amounts of annotations provided by users on social tagging systems in the form of bookmarks. In this paper, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags to perform a social classification of resources. For this purpose, we have created three large-scale social tagging data sets including tagging data for different types of resources, webpages and books. Those resources are accompanied by categorization data from sound expert-driven taxonomies. We analyze the characteristics of the three social tagging systems and perform an analysis on the usefulness of social tags to perform a social classification of resources that resembles the classification by experts as much as possible. We analyze six different representations using tags and compare to other data sources by using three different settings of SVM classifiers. Finally, we explore combinations of different data sources with tags using classifier committees to best classify the resources.},

  abstract  = {In this research, we propose a methodology for ontology construction and evolution using tags from tag-cloud to improve availability of analysis and utilization of large scale of data. It is possible to construct semantic relationships among tags. To do this, one way of building of relationships among tags is use of a popularized tag as a thing of ontology. However, it is not easy to select the popularized tag from tag cloud and to build a complete ontology with all of tags in the tag-cloud because tags are timely and dynamically updated added with tremendous numbers of tags. Therefore, we construct Primitive Ontologies (POs). A general tag is used to as a thing of a PO. The general tag is matched into one of requested keywords by users. In addition, we propose a methodology to evolve ontology using tags. To construct and evolve a PO, it defines classes and relationships between given tags by a user. Finally, the constructed several POs are integrated into a Tag-Based integrated Semantic ontology (TBiSont) by building relationships between classes that are included in each different PO. The construction of relationships among tags depends on linked resources into tags. The properties of tags are usually characterized by linked resources. It causes to extract semantic relationships among tags, because tags are comprised of meta-information that represents properties of resources. Thereby, the proposed PO is constructed by a general tag as a best-referring tag and relationships among tags including the general tag. The TBiSont as an integration of POs was applied into data analysis and a search process to verify efficiency of as in application systems. When we applied TBiSont into searching, it shows that TBiSont is more efficient than the other statistical-based search systems to increase accuracy or diversity of search results.},

These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions-from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E steps technique-Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution-which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy-expressed in a FO-to support ontology review and enhancement.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies. ¬© 2013 IEEE.},

Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. ¬© 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {This book outlines the basic principles of creation and maintenance of taxonomies and thesauri. It also provides step by step instructions for building a taxonomy or thesaurus and discusses the various ways to get started on a taxonomy construction project. Often, the first step is to get management and budgetary approval, so I start this book with a discussion of reasons to embark on the taxonomy journey. From there I move on to a discussion of metadata and how taxonomies and metadata are related, and then consider how, where, and why taxonomies are used. Information architecture has its cornerstone in taxonomies and metadata. While a good discussion of information architecture is beyond the scope of this work, I do provide a brief discussion of the interrelationships among taxonomies, metadata, and information architecture. Moving on to the central focus of this book, I introduce the basics of taxonomies, including a definition of vocabulary control and why it is so important, how i dexing and tagging relate to taxonomies, a few of the types of tagging, and a definition and discussion of post- and pre-coordinate indexing. After that I present the concept of a hierarchical structure for vocabularies and discuss the differences among various kinds of controlled vocabularies, such as taxonomies, thesauri, authority files, and ontologies. Once you have a green light for your project, what is the next step? Here I present a few options for the first phase of taxonomy construction and then a more detailed discussion of metadata and markup languages. I believe that it is important to understand the markup languages (SGML and XML specifically, and HTML to a lesser extent) in relation to information structure, and how taxonomies and metadata feed into that structure. After that, I present the steps required to build a taxonomy, from defining the focus, collecting and organizing terms, analyzing your vocabulary for even coverage over subject areas, filling in gaps, creatin relationships between terms, and applying those terms to your content. Here I offer a cautionary note: don‚Äôt believe that your taxonomy is ‚Äúdone!‚Äù Regular, scheduled maintenance is an important‚Äîcritical, really‚Äîcomponent of taxonomy construction projects. After you‚Äôve worked through the steps in this book, you will be ready to move on to integrating your taxonomy into the workflow of your organization. This is covered in Book 3 of this series.

Historically, the popular song has been classified as a subcategory of other musical objects. However, recent researches show that the popular song is a specific artistic form that is endowed with its own language and, therefore, demands specific techniques for analysis, representation and, consequently, classification. Considering the different approaches toward popular songs in catalogues and contemporary systems, this paper identifies possible solutions, such as the use of descriptive metadata, the use of collaborative tagging or the creation of an ontology. In discussing the construction of an epistemological foundation used specifically for classifying the popular song, we reflect on the remaining challenges for the knowledge organization of complex artistic documents.},

It is essential to conduct a comprehensive survey on the related work, which would benefit the research community by providing better understanding of the state-of-the-art and insights into the future research directions. The paper first defines the spectrum of Knowledge Organization Systems, from unstructured with less semantics to highly structured with richer semantics. It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories. We summarize the prominent issues with the current research and highlight future directions on learning constantly evolving knowledge from social media data.},

Task-oriented dialogue aims the solution of a given task in a given domain. Folksonomies are knowledge structures composed of users, tags and resources. Folksonomies emerge from the tagging process in collaborative tagging systems. Dialogues and folksonomies have in common their social dimension. One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process. This can be useful for instance, to retrieve the topics addressed by the interlocutors of the dialogues, in different time intervals. Experiments with a real-world task-oriented dialogue corpus were done.},

In this paper, we present a recommendation algorithm in a Web 2.0 platform that supports end users to collaboratively evolve ontologies by suggesting semantic relations between new and existing concepts. We use the Wikipedia category hierarchy to evaluate our algorithm and our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm produces high quality recommendations.},

  abstract        = {Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique (Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution), which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy (expressed in a FO) to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. ¬© 2015 Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, Centro de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnol√≥gico. All Rights Reserved.},

The semantic similarity of concepts which is measured using the words hierarchy of WordNet combined with relations of concepts extracted from the Wikipedia graph is applied to link the new eLearning concepts to the domain ontology. The generated ontology as an integrated knowledge of eLearning domain can be used to model educational activities and to build, organize, and update specific learning resources.

In this paper, we exploit a popular type of metadata called collaborative tags to address this issue. Specifically, we identify basic level concepts and then construct ontologies from the collaborative tags. The generated ontologies can be employed to organize and index user-generated multimedia data. Existing research lacks a principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human perspective. In contrast, we borrow the idea of a family of concepts called basic level concepts from cognitive psychology. These basic level concepts are frequently used by people in their daily life and when organizing human knowledge. In this paper, we extract ontologies with basic level concepts from collaborative tags. Furthermore, we model the effect of context and present a method for context-aware basic level concepts detection for ontology learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on context-aware basic level concept detection in collaborative tagging for the construction of ontologies. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were conducted on real datasets using the Open Directory Project (ODP) as a benchmark. The experimental results illustrate that ontologies extracted by our approach are more rational and human-oriented. ¬© 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to explore the hierarchical structure inside the images from the perspective of feature representation learning, which is applied to hierarchical image annotation. Different from the current trend in multimedia analysis of using pre-defined features or focusing on the end-task ‚Äúflat‚Äù representation, we propose a novel layer-wise tag- embedded deep learning (LTDL) model to learn hierarchical features which correspond to hierarchical semantic structures in the tag hierarchy . Unlike most existing deep learning models, LTDL utilizes both the visual content of the image and the hierarchical information of associated social tags. In the training stage, the two kinds of information are fused in a bottom-up way. Supervised training and multi-modal fusion alternate in a layer-wise way to learn feature hierarchies. To validate the effectiveness of LTDL, we conduct extensive experiments for hierarchical image annotation on a large-scale public dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed LTDL can learn representative features with improved performances.},

Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology.

  abstract      = {The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

We see great promise in using proven Web 2.0 techniques to enable semantic Web services technologies to rise to their potential. We propose the social service network (SSN) - a framework integrating Web 2.0 social aspects to automatically enrich Web services with semantic meanings based on community consensus. Additionally, we propose an innovative Web service recommendation system within the SSN that makes use of generated ontologies to discover similar and complementary Web services. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with a practical use case scenario.},

  abstract  = {A scheme for identifying the semantic layers of music-related tags is presented. Arguments are provided why the applications of the tags cannot be effectively pursued without a reasonable understanding of their semantic qualities. The identification scheme consists of a set of filters. The first is related with social consensus, user-count ratio, and n-gram properties of tags. The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out with an independent, smaller hand-annotated dataset, in which high agreement between the identification provided by the scheme and annotations was found.},

Their steady increase reveals a more dynamic and interactive space, in which users can individually and freely share online resources and assign terms to them. In this paper, we address the problem of how to exploit these rich systems to enrich existing ontologies. Our approach taps into external tools such as the sense inventory WordNet to fix mistakes resulting from the free tagging and takes advantage from semantic relationships between tags to recognize resources' context. We carried out evaluations that mainly paid attention on the particularly challenging problem of resources' ambiguity to prove that not all resources shared in folksonomies are relevant resources for Dbpedia ontology. In this respect, it is worth of mention that our pre-processing step increases precision values to achieve an average precision of 80%.},

  abstract        = {The cross-sections of the Social Web and the Semantic Web has put folksonomy in the spot light for its potential in overcoming knowledge acquisition bottleneck and providing insight for "wisdom of the crowds". Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. ¬© 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

The availability of large-scale high quality domain ontologies depends on effective and usable methodologies aimed at supporting the crucial process of ontology building. Ontology building exhibits a structural and logical complexity that is comparable to the production of software artefacts. This paper proposes an ontology building methodology that capitalizes the large experience drawn from a widely used standard in software engineering: the Unified Software Development Process or Unified Process (UP). In particular, we propose UP for ONtology (UPON) building, a methodology for ontology building derived from the UP. UPON is presented with the support of a practical example in the eBusiness domain. A comparative evaluation with other methodologies and the results of its adoption in the context of the Athena EU Integrated Project are also discussed.},
