  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy. One problem offolksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task. © 2007 IEEE.},

For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model.

This paper presents a novel method that overcomes this problem by automatically generating an annotated corpus based on a specific ontology. Then the corpus was enriched with new and informative features extracted from Wikipedia data. Moreover, rather than pursuing rule-based methods as in literature, we employ a machine learning model to not only disambiguate but also identify named entities. In addition, our method explores in details the use of a range of features extracted from texts, a given ontology, and Wikipedia data for disambiguation. This paper also systematically analyzes impacts of the features on disambiguation accuracy by varying their combinations for representing named entities. Empirical evaluation shows that, while the ontology provides basic features of named entities, Wikipedia is a fertile source for additional features to construct accurate and robust named entity disambiguation systems.},

Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keywordbased and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords. © 2008 IEEE.},

While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system.

Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract  = {Tagging is one of the most popular services in Web 2.0. As a special form of tagging, social tagging is done collaboratively by many users, which forms a so-called folksonomy. As tagging has become widespread on the Web, the tag vocabulary is now very informal, uncontrolled, and personalized. For this reason, many tags are unfamiliar and ambiguous to users so that they fail to understand the meaning of each tag. In this paper, we propose a tag sense disambiguating method, called tag sense disambiguation (TSD), which works in the social tagging environment. TSD can be applied to the vocabulary of social tags, thereby enabling users to understand the meaning of each tag through Wikipedia. To find the correct mappings from del.icio.us tags to Wikipedia articles, we define the local neighbor tags, the global neighbor tags, and finally the neighbor tags that would be the useful key-words for disambiguating the sense of each tag based on the tag co-occurrences. The automatically built mappings are reasonable in most cases. The experiment shows that TSD can find the correct mappings with high accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging is an innovative and powerful mechanism introduced with Web 2.0: it shifts the task of classifying resources from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

Therefore, relevant results are not retrieved in the user's query. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to enhance the "social vocabulary" presented in folksonomies with the "controlled vocabulary" presented in Semantic Web ontologies. Therefore, our proposed approach uses the online WordNet lexical ontology in addition to the EuroWordNet multilingual lexical resource. Our approach tries to employ the ontological relations presented in WordNet in the folksonomy, it focuses only on the problems of synonyms, tag relations, and multilinguality.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging to annotate resources represents one of the innovative aspects introduced with Web 2.0 and the new challenges of the (semantic) Web 3.0. Social tagging, also known as user-generated keywords or folksonomies, implies that keywords, from an arbitrarily large and uncontrolled vocabulary, are used by a large community of readers to describe resources. Despite undeniable success and usefulness of social tagging systems, they also suffer from some drawbacks: the proliferation of social tags, coming as they are from an unrestricted vocabulary leads to ambiguity when determining their intended meaning; the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata leads to confusions as to their roles and justification; and the flatness of the structure of the keywords and lack of relationships among them imply difficulties in relating different keywords when they describe the same or similar concepts. So in order to increase precision, in the searches and classifications made possible by folksonomies, some experiences and results from formal classification and subjecting systems are considered, in order to help solve, if not to prevent altogether, the ambiguities that are intrinsic in such systems. Some successful and not so successful approaches as proposed in the scientific literature are discussed, and a few more are introduced here to further help dealing with special cases. In particular, we believe that adding depth and structure to the terms used in folksonomies could help in word sense disambiguation, as well as correctly identifying and classifying proper names, metaphors, and slang words when used as social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

For example, in services that use citation data to compute the impact of authors, ambiguous names lead to biased measures. The problem is amplified where names are collected from heterogeneous sources, including crowd sourced annotations. This is the case in the Scholaro meter system, which cross-correlates author names in user queries with those retrieved from bibliographic data. The uncontrolled nature of user-generated annotations is very valuable, but creates the need to detect ambiguous names. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect ambiguous names at query time, which makes it applicable in the context of a social computing application. We explore two kinds of heuristic features based on citations and crowd sourced topics. Our approach can detect ambiguous author names in crowd sourced scholarly data with an accuracy of 75%.},

  abstract        = {Due to the popularity of collaborative tagging services and systems, the role of social tags in information organization and retrieval has become increasingly critical within the tagging system. Consequently, the resolution of semantic ambiguity of tag sense (i.e., meaning) plays an important role in the enhancement of information organization and retrieval in collaborative tagging applications. Our approach to tackle the task of automatic resolution of semantic ambiguity is based on the hypothesis that given a target tag, some of the co-occurring social tags that were selectively assigned by the same or by different people to the same resource can serve as a useful dataset. Four different methods (i.e., two LSA-based, LIN-based, and Cooccurrence method) for tag sense disambiguation are proposed and their results are compared, aiming to automatically rank the senses associated with a given target tag. The experimental results with a Delicious dataset indicate that LSA-w and LIN-based methods produce more stable performances, and suggest the same two methods for the Tag Sense Disambiguation task, particularly in the situation that the Boolean effect is more likely to arise.},

The practice of tagging is done in a collective environment. Folksonomies are self constructed, based on co-occurrence of definitions, rather than a hierarchical structure of the data. The downside of this was that a few sites and applications are able to successfully exploit the sharing of bookmarks. The need for tools that are able to resolve the ambiguity of the definitions is becoming urgent as the need of simple instruments for their visualization, editing and exploitation in web applications still hinders their diffusion and wide adoption. An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces. To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called " Folksodriven" is used in this paper. While it is presented the Folks driven Structure Network (FSN) to resolve the ambiguity of definitions of folksonomy tags suggestions for the user. On this base a Human-Computer Interactive (HCI) systems is developed for the visualization, navigation, updating and maintenance of folksonomies Knowledge Bases - the FSN - through the web.

In sites such as Del.icio.us, Technorati or Flickr, users annotate a variety of resources, including Web pages, blogs, pictures, videos or bibliographic references; using freely chosen textual labels or tags. Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web. In this paper we present an empirical study carried out to determine the value of tags in resource classification. Furthermore, the use of several filtering and pre-processing operations to reduce the ambiguity and noise in tags are analyzed to determine whether they allow to increase the quality of resource classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Social tagging, also noted as collaborative tagging or folksonomy, is an important way for users themselves to describe resources on the Web. The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract  = {In tag-word disambiguation, a word is assigned to a specific context chosen among the different ones to which it is related. Relatedness to a context is often defined based on the co-occurrence of the target word with other words (context words) in sentences of a specific corpus. The overall disambiguation process can be thought as a classification process, where the context words play the role of features for the target. A problem with this approach is that the large number of possible context words can reduce the classification performance, both in terms of computational effort and in terms of quality of the outcome. Feature selection can improve the process in both regards, by reducing the overall feature space to a manageable size with high information content. In this work we propose to use, in disambiguation, a feature selection approach based on the Shapley Value (SV) - a Coalitional Game Theory related metrics, measuring the importance of a component within a coalition. By including in the feature set only the words with the highest Shapley Value, we obtain remarkable quality and performance improvements. The problem of the exponential complexity in the exact SV computation is avoided by an approximate computation based on sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and of the sampling approach results, by using both a synthetic language corpus and a real world linguistic corpus.},

ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing relations between tags.},

In our previous research, we used those synonym pairs to derive a number of strategies to create tag synonyms automatically. In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities. We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},

This provides the context for disambiguating the semantic of tags and it can be used to refine searches and/or suggestions. Moreover, this leads to alleviate some of the problems regarding the use of a natural vocabulary in a faceted classification. We provide some definitions and show examples of the so-called second generation of tag-clouds. We conclude with some implications that make use of the layout algorithm for visualizing a set of more than 400 tags.},

We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},
