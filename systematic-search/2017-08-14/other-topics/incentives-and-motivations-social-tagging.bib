  abstract  = {There are currently very few practical methods for assessing the quality of resources or the reliability of other entities in the online environment. This makes it difficult to make decisions about which resources can be relied upon and which entities it is safe to interact with. Trust and reputation systems are aimed at solving this problem by enabling service consumers to reliably assess the quality of services and the reliability of entities before they decide to use a particular service or to interact with or depend on a given entity. Such systems should also allow serious service providers and online players to correctly represent the reliability of themselves and the quality of their services. In the case of reputation systems, the basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive its reputation score. In the case of trust systems, the basic idea is to analyse and combine paths and networks of trust relationships in order to derive measures of trustworthiness of specific nodes. Reputation scores and trust measures can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with a given party in the future, and whether it is safe to depend on a given resource or entity. This represents an incentive for good behaviour and for offering reliable resources, which thereby tends to have a positive effect on the quality of online markets and communities. This chapter describes the background, current status and future trend of online trust and reputation systems.},

The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of existing and proposed systems that can be used to derive measures of trust and reputation for Internet transactions, to analyse the current trends and developments in this area, and to propose a research agenda for trust and reputation systems.},

This paper addresses three issues related to this question. (1) What distinctions of user motivations are identified by previous research, and in what ways are the motivations of users amenable to quantitative analysis? (2) To what extent does tagging motivation vary across different social tagging systems? (3) How does variability in user motivation influence resulting tags and folksonomies? In this paper, we present measures to detect whether a tagger is primarily motivated by categorizing or describing resources, and apply these measures to datasets from seven different tagging systems. Our results show that (a) users’ motivation for tagging varies not only across, but also within tagging systems, and that (b) tag agreement among users who are motivated by categorizing resources is significantly lower than among users who are motivated by describing resources. Our findings are relevant for (1) the development of tag-based user interfaces, (2) the analysis of tag semantics and (3) the design of search algorithms for social tagging systems.},

  abstract  = {The performance of many emerging communication paradigms depend on high levels of cooperation amongst the peers in the network. Although an individual's best strategy may be to selfishly consume resources without reciprocation, the optimal social performance requires agents in the network to behave in an altruistic manner. This paper considers a P2P data dissemination scenario, and applies an autonomic trust protocol that forms social network structures to incentive cooperation. Trust links are formed according to the simple criterion that `individuals seek to interact with others at least as cooperative as themselves' and these links are used to prioritise the choice of peers to interact with. The success of the protocol is validated through a prisoner's dilemma based simulation which uses the similarity of interest between peers to define pay-offs. While the variation in interests reduces the average payoff (per iteration) received by the most cooperative individuals, only the most `divergent' and uncooperative nodes are heavily affected and ostracized from interaction by other cooperative nodes.},

Based on Ames's theoretical framework on motivation, we propose a model for knowledge contribution in problem-solving virtual communities (PSVCs). The model includes two second-order individual motivations, with four major mechanisms in PSVCs that are associated with these motivations. Results confirm that only egoistic motives affect members' knowledge contribution in PSVCs. Further, knowledge repository and social identity are found to be important mechanisms for promoting knowledge contribution through egoistic motives. This paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications and provides insights for future research.},

Current methods to provide such metadata are impractical for the volume of services published on the Web: they are too expensive to be implemented by a service broker, and too difficult to be used for retrieval. We introduce structured collaborative tagging to address these issues. Here, user tags not only aspects relevant for her but also suggested ones (input, output and behavior). Cost, performance and usability of the proposed technique obtained during the Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest are reported. Obtained results suggests that there is no "free lunch." While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, the reasons for people's meta-knowledge contribution in the social computing context and the extent to which this may differ from traditional knowledge contribution remain largely unexplored.

Different kinds of tags are used by various stakeholders to categorize and organize work items. The tags are used to support finding of tasks, articulation work, and information exchange.

  abstract  = {While many Web 2.0-inspired approaches to semantic content authoring do acknowledge motivation and incentives as the main drivers of user involvement, the amount of useful human contributions actually available will always remain a scarce resource. Complementarily, there are aspects of semantic content authoring in which automatic techniques have proven to perform reliably, and the added value of human (and collective) intelligence is often a question of cost and timing. The challenge that this book attempts to tackle is how these two approaches (machine- and human-driven computation) could be combined in order to improve the cost-performance ratio of creating, managing, and meaningfully using semantic content. To do so, we need to first understand how theories and practices from social sciences and economics about user behavior and incentives could be applied to semantic content authoring. We will introduce a methodology to help software designers to embed incentives-minded functiona ities into semantic applications, as well as best practices and guidelines. We will present several examples of such applications, addressing tasks such as ontology management, media annotation, and information extraction, which have been built with these considerations in mind. These examples illustrate key design issues of incentivized Semantic Web applications that might have a significant effect on the success and sustainable development of the applications: the suitability of the task and knowledge domain to the intended audience, and the mechanisms set up to ensure high-quality contributions, and extensive user involvement.

  abstract  = {A social tagging system, such as del.icio.us and Flickr, allows users to annotate resources (e.g., web pages and photos) with text descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable information for searching, mining, and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result, while some highly-popular resources are over-tagged, most of the resources are under-tagged. Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-based techniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tag specific resources, how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcing environment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this question by observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been tagged a sufficient number of times. We formalize the concepts of tagging quality (TQ) and tagging stability (TS) in measuring the quality of a resource's tag description. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed “budget” (i.e., the amount of money paid for tagging resources). This solution decides the amount of rewards that should be invested on each resource in order to maximize tagging stability. We further propose a few simple, practical, and efficient incentive allocation strategies. On a dataset from del.icio.us, our best strategy provides resources with a close-to-optimal gain in tagging stability.},

The framework we use shows the components that comprise the tagging system and how they interact together to direct tagging behaviour. We analysed two collaborative tagging systems: CiteULike and Delicious by studying their components by applying our framework. Using datasets from both systems, we found that 35% of CiteULike users did not provide tags compared to only 0.1% of Delicious users. This was directly linked to the type of tools used by the system designer to support tagging.},

We discuss several plausible heuristics people might employ to decide on tags to use for a given item, and then describe methods for testing evidence of such strategies in real collaborative tagging data. Using a large dataset of annotations collected from users of the social music website Last.fm with a novel crawling methodology (approximately one millions total users), we extract the parameters for our decision-making models from the data. We then describe a set of simple multi-agent simulations that test our heuristic models, and compare their results to the extracted parameters from the tagging dataset. Results indicate that simple social copying mechanisms can generate surprisingly good fits to the empirical data, with implications for the design and study of tagging systems.},

However, tagging code is tedious. To make code tagging more fun, we introduce a social gasification approach: developers independently tag code fragments and are rewarded if their solutions conform to the solution of other developers. We implemented the game as a Facebook plug-in. A pilot user study suggests that the game mechanics are motivating and promote the proposition of reasonable tags.},

While any one individual may not provide sufficient samples, aggregating samples across many individuals provides high-quality, high-coverage measurements of the phenomena. Thus, for participatory sensing to be successful, one must motivate a large number of individuals to participate. In this work, we review a variety of incentive mechanisms that motivate people to contribute to a CS effort. We then establish a set of design constraints or minimum requirements that any incentive mechanism for CS must have. These design constrains are then used as metrics to evaluate those approaches and determine their advantages and disadvantages. We also contribute a taxonomy of CS incentive mechanisms and show how current systems fit within this taxonomy. We conclude with the identification of new types of incentive mechanisms that require further investigation.},

However, many interactions among individuals can be modeled as Prisoner's Dilemma game, which suppresses the emergence of cooperation. In order to provide scalable and robust services in such systems, incentive mechanisms need to be introduced. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism called recommendation incentive mechanism based on evolutionary dynamics(RIMBED). In our RIMBED system, players who pay an additional cost for recommendation service not only can get the information of the opponents, but also can have a higher probability to interact with cooperative individuals. Using the replicator dynamics equations in evolutionary game theory, we mathematically analyze the robustness and effectiveness of our RIMBED system. Meanwhile, simulation experiments can also validate our mathematical analysis. In our RIMBED system, players have three alternative strategies: always cooperative(ALLC), always defective(ALLD) and rational cooperative(RC). No one strategy can dominate the others forever and all the three strategies can survive in our system. When we bring in population invasion and a small mutation, our system can still work at an excellent level.},

  abstract        = {Social tags take an important role in exploratory search. In collaborative tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources with tags. The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has grown in popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs and other content. In this paper we analyze the structure of collaborative tagging systems as well as their dynamic aspects. Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given URL. We also present a dynamic model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge. © CILIP.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

  abstract = {Tags, words or short phrases attached to items on the Internet, organize the social Web. Unlike expert-maintained taxonomies such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, tags evolve organically based on the collective action of individual users. The collection of tags in a tagging system, called a folksonomy, can vary widely from site to site. The paper mentions that the combination of eager taggers and intelligent algorithms that nurture effective tagging behavior promises a bright future for tagging systems.},
