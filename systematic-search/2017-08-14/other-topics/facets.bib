  abstract  = {Abstract: Semantic Web technologies have not replicated the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. The underlying problems are the inability of keywords to express the semantics of a query, and the functional possibilities and limitations of web applications. Searching for information is difficult and time intensive because of the lower efficiency of keyword-based search; results are often very different from the information seeker’s expectations/requirements. The human mind understands and processes information in multiple dimensions, thus the search method should also involve multiple facets. Facet analysis has been applied to knowledge organization in library and information science and also in artificial intelligence for the design of information retrieval systems. A simplified model to interface between users, information depositors, data repositories, and search engines could lead to the development of a tool which is understandable to both machine and human. The model would be based on the concept of facets and facetization so as to handle the conceptual aspect, and would also be translated to Semantic Web languages for comprehensibility by robots and crawlers. },

In the industrial context of music related services where social and sharing aspects are omnipresent, we also present a novel feature to enable the visual comparison of music collections.},

We introduce the possibility of (i) labeling linking tags to construct a network of tags and (ii) defining the concrete meaning of a tag by choosing the right definition extracted from Wikimedia projects or by writing down a particular definition. This provides the context for disambiguating the semantic of tags and it can be used to refine searches and/or suggestions. Moreover, this leads to alleviate some of the problems regarding the use of a natural vocabulary in a faceted classification. We provide some definitions and show examples of the so-called second generation of tag-clouds. We conclude with some implications that make use of the layout algorithm for visualizing a set of more than 400 tags.},

  abstract        = {Web 2.0 applications such as delicious, flickr or lastfm have recently become extremely popular and as a result, a large amount of semantically rich metadata produced by users becomes available and exploitable. Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

  abstract  = {This paper provides a general introduction to the concept of implicit human-centered tagging (IHCT) - the automatic extraction of tags from nonverbal behavioral feedback of media users. The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be "implicit". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented). The paper discusses these issues in detail and provides an overview of pioneering efforts in the field.},
