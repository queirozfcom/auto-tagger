  abstract  = {Abstract: Semantic Web technologies have not replicated the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. The underlying problems are the inability of keywords to express the semantics of a query, and the functional possibilities and limitations of web applications. Searching for information is difficult and time intensive because of the lower efficiency of keyword-based search; results are often very different from the information seeker’s expectations/requirements. The human mind understands and processes information in multiple dimensions, thus the search method should also involve multiple facets. Facet analysis has been applied to knowledge organization in library and information science and also in artificial intelligence for the design of information retrieval systems. A simplified model to interface between users, information depositors, data repositories, and search engines could lead to the development of a tool which is understandable to both machine and human. The model would be based on the concept of facets and facetization so as to handle the conceptual aspect, and would also be translated to Semantic Web languages for comprehensibility by robots and crawlers. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: This chapter focuses on classification schemes that provide for the in-depth subject coverage suitable for specialist library collections. Universal Decimal Classification is examined, with sections on its subject coverage and use and practical exercises. The focus then shifts to fully faceted classification, with an examination of Colon Classification and Bliss Bibliographic Classification as examples of general faceted library classification schemes. This is followed by an overview of schemes created to organise specialist subject areas, with outlines of the London Classification of Business Studies and the National Library of Medicine Classification. The chapter concludes with a section on how to create a special classification scheme. },

In this communication, we focus on the visual comparison of personal music collections. We introduce an interactive and tridimensional system which allows their visualization using a music archipelago metaphor and relying on a facet-based engine. In the industrial context of music related services where social and sharing aspects are omnipresent, we also present a novel feature to enable the visual comparison of music collections.},
