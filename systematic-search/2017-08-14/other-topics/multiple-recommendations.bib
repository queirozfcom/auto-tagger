  abstract      = {Recommendations in collaborative tagging sites such as del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies, are becoming increasingly important, due to the proliferation of general queries on those sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address those queries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy, item-based or user-based, one of the key concerns in producing recommendations, is over-specialization, which results in returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processing returned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (e.g., genre and actors for movies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are not available (e.g., URLs in del.icio.us). In a recent paper [20], we introduced the notion of explanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise between accuracy and diversity. In this paper, we develop efficient diversification algorithms built upon this notion. The algorithms explore compromises between accuracy and diversity. We demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in diversification on two real life data sets: del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract        = {We present a preliminarily study on the influence of different sources of information in Web 2.0 systems on recommendation. Aiming to identify which are the sources of information (ratings, tags, social contacts, etc.) most valuable for recommendation, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering and social recommenders on a heterogeneous dataset obtained from Last.fm. Moreover, aiming to investigate whether and how fusion of such information sources can benefit individual recommendation approaches, we propose various metrics to measure coverage, overlap, diversity and novelty between different sets of recommendations. The obtained results show that, in Last.fm, social tagging and explicit social networking information provide effective and heterogeneous item recommendations. Moreover, they give first insights on the feasibility of exploiting the above non performance recommendation characteristics by hybrid approaches. © 2010 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging has emerged as a mechanism to describe items in large on-line collections. Tags are assigned by users to describe and find back items, but it is also tempting to describe the users in terms of the tags they assign or in terms of the tags of the items they are interested in. The tag-based profile thus obtained can be used to recommend new items. If we recommend new items by computing their similarity to the user profile or to all items seen by the user, we run into the risk of recommending only neutral items that are a bit relevant for each topic a user is interested in. In order to increase user satisfaction many recommender systems not only optimize for accuracy but also for diversity. Often it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between accuracy and diversity. In this paper we introduce topic aware recommendation algorithms. Topic aware algorithms first detect different interests in the user profile and then generate recommendations for each of these interests. We study topic aware variants of three tag based recommendation algorithms and show that each of them gives better recommendations than their base variants, both in terms of precision and recall and in terms of diversity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

  abstract = {The explosive growth and wide-spread accessibility of community-contributed multimedia contents on the Internet have led to a surging research activity in social image search. However, the existing tag-based search methods frequently return irrelevant or redundant results. To quickly target user's intention in the result returned by an ambiguous query, we first put forward that the top-ranked search results should meet some criteria, i.e., relevance, typicality and diversity. With the three criteria, a novel ranking scheme for social image search is proposed which incorporates both semantic similarity and visual similarity. The ranking list with relevance, typicality and diversity is returned by optimizing a measure named Average Diverse Precision. The typicality score of samples is estimated via the probability density in the space of visual features. The diversity among the top-ranked list is achieved by fusing both semantic and visual similarities of images. A comprehensive approach for calculating visual similarity is considered by fusing the similarity values according to different features. To further benefit ranking performance, a data-driven method is implemented to refine the tags of social image. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper.},

  abstract  = {Diversity and novelty of items in recommendation, and coverage of overall recommended items are emerging recommendation quality measures for user and system respectively. These measures tend to alleviate the problem of user satisfaction in terms of redundancy in recommendations caused by accuracy-oriented approaches. This work proposes solution to provide diversity in different modes when we are dealing with multi-mode data. To provide diverse suggestion list of communities to join, the proposed framework uses Tensor Decomposition to reveal latent topics among multi-mode data including communities, users and social tags. It exploits co-clustering approaches on decomposed components to extract clusters of communities based on user similarity and tag similarity. Afterwards, clusters' information is used to develop and apply re-ranking algorithms, which leads to improvement in diversity and coverage of recommended lists.},
