  abstract  = {Online social networks have become popular for communication among people. Previous works on social networks were focused mainly on a single network due to the lack of links from one network to the others. There are several ways to connect different social networks. One possible solution is to find out the same individual who owns accounts for different social networks simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on the problem of linking the same users across different social networks. We start from a basic solution based on profile comparison, which is then improved by considering additional social relationships, i.e., friends. Finally, we propose a two-phase clustering method to generate a social summary for each individual. The first phase is to select strongly-connected groups as seeds. The second phase is to assign non-seeds to the clusters based on the social structure and profiles. The final distributions over various clusters are regarded as the social summary. The experiments have been conducted on two real social networking datasets. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed (social summary) method, compared to the methods of profile comparison and person-name comparison.},

Discovering the correspondence between accounts of a same individual is a crucial prerequisite for many interesting cross network applications, such as improving the recommendation performance of the online shopping sites by using extra information from social network services. In this paper, we propose a gametheoretic method to identify correlation accounts of individuals between social network sites and online shopping sites with stable matching model, incorporating accounts profiles as well as historical behaviors. The results show that our method identifies up to 70% of correlation accounts between Facebook and eBay, one of the most popular social network sites and online shopping sites in the world, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, developers can be involved in several software developer communities like StackOverflow and Github. Meanwhile, accounts from different communities are usually less connected. Linking these accounts, which is called identity linkage, is a prerequisite of many interesting studies such as investigating activities of one developer in two or more communities. Many researches have been performed on social networks, but very few of them can be adapted to software communities, as information of users provided in these communities has a huge difference to that in social networks. We tackle with the problem by introducing TBIL, a novel tagging-based approach to identity linkage among software communities. The essential idea of this approach is to employ skills (measured by tags), usernames and concerned topics of developers as hints, and to use a decision tree-based algorithm and another heuristic greedy matching algorithm to link user identities. We measure the effectiveness of TBIL on two well-known software communities, i.e., StackOverflow and Github. The results show that our method is feasible and practical in linking developer identities. In particular, the F-Score of our method is 0.15 higher than previous identity linkage methods in software communities.},

  abstract  = {Social network analysis has emerged as an important research area in intelligence analysis to facilitate decision-maker in more informed decisions. With the passage of time social network services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal investigations including understanding and tracking of dark networks, i.e., illegal and covert networks. Criminal organizations are well-suited to be studied using social network analysis as they consist of networks of individuals that span countries and continents using false identities over different networks to remain anonymous. There is a need to recognize the criminals carrying different fake identities to correctly track their immoral activities. This research article is focusing on devising a method which can be used to identify group of people i.e. criminal, terrorist or friends on different Social networks by analyzing patterns and performing correlations across different social network systems. Data integration using cross correlation is used to merge entities to form single fused networks. This single fused network also estimate the intensity of relationship between individuals in general networks based on the number of networks they are connected. To best of our knowledge no such studies is done in the social network analysis, therefore this method is unique and offers innovations in making effective use of presence of people in different networks.},

  abstract  = {The rapid growth of smart phones and recent advances in telephony have triggered an enormous increase in the number of telephony subscribers. Some people have more than one calling identity for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Discovering multiple identities of an individual can be important for fraud detection, detection of coordinated criminals, collaborative recommendations, and analyses of complete social graph of an individual. To address the challenge of finding identities that belong to a single individual, this paper describes ID-CONNECT, an approach for linking multiple identities of an individual based on that individual's social call graph and call behavior. The approach is based on the assumption that similarity between identities can be better estimated by using both call network and call behavior of identities towards their friends and that the more similar the weighted call graph of two identities, the higher is the similarity between them. ID-CONNECT is a two-step approach: 1) it estimates similarity between identities by incorporating call rate and duration, and 2) it generates sets of candidate identities for each target identity. We experimentally evaluate our approach on different random graph models and compare its performance against other approaches. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly reduces candidate set size (up to 70%) while achieving comparable true positive rate.},

  abstract  = {Web-based platforms, such as social networks, review web-sites, and e-commerce web-sites, commonly use recommendation systems to serve their users. The common practice is to have each platform captures and maintains data related to its own users. Later the data is analyzed to produce user specific recommendations. We argue that recommendations could be enriched by considering data consolidated from multiple sources instead of limiting the analysis to data captured from a single source. Integrating data from multiple sources is analogous to watching the behavior and preferences of each user on multiple platforms instead of a limited one platform based vision. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which utilizes user specific data collected from multiple platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to make recommendations by consulting multiple social networks to produce a rich modeling of user behavior. For this purpose, we collected and anonymized a specific dataset that contains information from BlogCatalog, Twitter and Flickr web-sites. We implemented several different types of recommendation methodologies to observe their performances while using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources. The conducted experiments showed that using multiple features from multiple social networks produces a wider perspective of user behavior and preferences leading to improved recommendation outcome.},

  abstract  = {Since cyber offenders often create multiple accounts on different Social Media Platforms (SMPs) to serve their disparate malicious intentions, law enforcement agency investigators often encounter the task of recognizing all the accounts used by the same person across SMPs, i.e., account linkage (AL). Although a number of techniques have been proposed for AL, their performance may be degraded by factors such as information asymmetry, poor data quality, data unavailability, as well as application scope limitation. In this paper, we solve AL in an unsupervised manner by utilizing user-generated geo-location data in SMPs, which is more robust than common clues used in existing techniques. A co-clustering-based AL framework is proposed in which account clusterings in temporal and spatial dimensions are carried out synchronously and enhance the results of each other. Experiments carried out on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed framework.},

It is a challenging task because information provided by users on an SNS platform could be false, conflicting, missing and deceptive. One way to gain an accurate profile of a user is to link up all their multiple accounts created on different social platforms, which is referred to as Account Linkage (AL). However, existing AL techniques suffer from the problem of information unreliability. Recent advances in location acquisition and wireless communication technologies give rise to new opportunities for AL. In this paper, we propose a framework that links up multiple accounts belonging to the same individual by comparing habit patterns extracted from user-generated location data. We built a topic model to capture users habit patterns in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Results of experiments carried out on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed framework.},
