  abstract  = {Online shopping sites are faced with a significant problem: When offering experience products, i.e., products that lack a helpful description in terms of easily accessible factual properties (e.g., wine, cigars, and movies), a lot of work and time needs to be invested to provide such information. Two very popular approaches are the introduction of sophisticated categorization systems (e.g., fruity, woody, and peppery for wines) along with manual product classification performed by experts and the addition of user feedback mechanisms (e.g., ratings or textual reviews). While user feedback typically is easy to collect, for purposes of product search, it cannot be used as easily as this is possible with a systematic categorization scheme. In this paper, we propose an effective method to automatically derive product classifications of high quality from many different kinds of user feedback. Our semi-supervised method combines advanced data extraction methods with state-of-the-art classification algorithms and only requires a small number of training examples to be created manually by experts. We prove the benefits of our approach by performing an extensive evaluation in the movie domain.},

  abstract        = {Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},
