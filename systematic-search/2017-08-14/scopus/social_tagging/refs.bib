abstract={Traditional collaborative filtering based recommender systems for social network systems bring very high demands on time complexity due to computing similarities of all pairs of users via resource usages and annotation actions, which thus strongly suppresses recommending speed. In this paper, to overcome this drawback, we propose a novel approach, namely coarse cluster that partitions similar users and associated items at a high speed to enhance user-based collaborative filtering, and then develop a fast collaborative user model for the social tagging systems. The experimental results based on Delicious dataset show that the proposed model is able to dramatically reduce the processing time cost greater than 90% and relatively improve the accuracy in comparison with the ordinary user-based collaborative filtering, and is robust for the initial parameter. Most importantly, the proposed model can be conveniently extended by introducing more users’ information (e.g., profiles) and practically applied for the large-scale social network systems to enhance the recommending speed without accuracy loss. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social tags serve as a textual source of simple but useful semantic metadata that reflect user preferences or describe web objects and have been widely used in many applications. However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e. non-IIDness), which means that existing text analysis methods such as LDA are not directly applicable. In this article, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation that models tag generation based on both users and objects and, thus, accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as a user-topic distribution matrix and an object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets showed that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely-used point-wise mutual information (PMI) metric. In addition, we analyze the learned topics and show that our model recovers more themes from social tags, while LDA may lead to vanishing topic problems. We also demonstrate our model's advantages in social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristics of the social tagging process. IEEE},

abstract={A folksonomy consists of three basic entities, namely users, tags and resources. This kind of social tagging system is a good way to index information, facilitate searches and navigate resources. The main objective of this paper is to present a novel method to improve the quality of tag recommendation. According to the statistical analysis, we find that the total number of tags used by a user changes over time in a social tagging system. Thus, this paper introduces the concept of user tagging status, namely the growing status, the mature status and the dormant status. Then, the determining user tagging status algorithm is presented considering a user’s current tagging status to be one of the three tagging status at one point. Finally, three corresponding strategies are developed to compute the tag probability distribution based on the statistical language model in order to recommend tags most likely to be used by users. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the compared methods at the accuracy of tag recommendation. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={With the wide application of Web-2.0 and social software, there are more and more tag-related studies and applications. Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system. © 2017 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.},

abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The cultural heritage sector has embraced social tagging as a way to increase both access to online content and to engage users with their digital collections. In this article, we build on two current lines of research. (a) We use Waisda?, an existing labeling game, to add time-based annotations to content. (b) In this context, we investigate the role of experts in human-based computation (nichesourcing). We report on a small-scale experiment in which we applied Waisda? to content from film archives. We study the differences in the type of time-based tags between experts and novices for film clips in a crowdsourcing setting. The findings show high similarity in the number and type of tags (mostly factual). In the less frequent tags, however, experts used more domain-specific terms. We conclude that competitive games are not suited to elicit real expert-level descriptions. We also confirm that providing guidelines, based on conceptual frameworks that are more suited to moving images in a time-based fashion, could result in increasing the quality of the tags, thus allowing for creating more tag-based innovative services for online audiovisual heritage. © 2016 ASIS&T},

abstract={Collaborative tagging which is the keystone of the social practices of web 2.0 has been highly developed in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

Therefore, the definition of profile is crucial for tagging systems. Furthermore, it is important to have recommendations for various groups of users. In recipe recommendations, older people typically have different needs compared with young users. In this paper, we first focus on the definitions of user profile, item feature and how to derive semantics from these sources. Afterwards, we design the framework of the tag-based multimedia recipe recommendation system (MRRS).

abstract={In m-learning environments, context-awareness is for wide use where learners' situations are varied, dynamic and unpredictable. We are facing the challenge of requirements of both generality and depth in generating and processing high-level context. In this paper, we present a social approach which exploits social dynamics and social computing for generating high-level context. It is a novel and generic paradigm where the crowds of learners in m-learning environments directly engage in creating contents about high-level context and interactions by social tagging, and these contents and interactions are further explored to discover more implicit and complex high-level contextual information. We present the concept model, the context representation, the context matrix, and the context retrieval method. We evaluate our approach by a social simulation based experiment. The experimental results demonstrate that the context retrieval performance is improved in both the accuracy and the diversity, and validate that the proposed social approach is effective for generating high-level context. © Authors.},

abstract={With the spread of wearable cameras, many consumer applications ranging from social tagging to video summarization would greatly benefit from people re-identification methods capable of dealing with the egocentric perspective. In this regard, first-person camera views present such a unique setting that traditional re-identification methods results in poor performance when applied to this scenario. In this paper, we present a simple but effective solution that overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches by dividing people images into meaningful body parts. Furthermore, by taking into account human gaze information concerning where people look at when trying to recognize a person, we devise a meaningful way to weight the contributions of different bodyparts. Experimental results validate the proposal on a novel egocentric re-identification dataset, the first of its kind, showing that the performance increases when compared to current state of the art on egocentric sequences is significant. © 2016 IEEE.},

This study is an attempt to determine the similarities between social tags extracted from LibraryThing and Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) for the titles chosen for study by adopting Cosine similarity method. The result shows that social tags and controlled vocabularies are not quite similar due to the free nature of social tags mostly assigned by users whereas controlled vocabularies are attributed by subject experts. In the context of information retrieval and text mining, the Cosine similarity is most commonly adopted method to evaluate the similarity of vectors as it provides an important measurement in terms of degree to know how similar two documents are likely to be in relation to their subject matter. The LibraryThing tags and LCSH are represented in vectors to measure Cosine similarity between them. © 2016 Institute of China Studies. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Web 3.0 and social bookmarking have altered the traditional roles of the indexer and user. Recently, web, allows users to create, organize, and search for images and other information sources through social tagging and other method activities. One of the image social bookmarking is such as Flickr. This research examines to increase the efficiency of image search result by creating indexes. The assumption of the experiment is a combination of social tagging and other factor such as image description that can improve web performance. Therefore, three indexers were created and were compared with the search results between a search engine using the indexing method of "Description with Tag" or DT indexer, "Posted Time With Tag" or PT indexer and the "Tag only" or T indexer which is a native method. The retrieval performance of this search engine is evaluated using the mean values of Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain (NDCG). The result illustrates that the search engine with indexer using DT indexer provides better indexer using the T indexer in all the ranks. This primary evaluation in the experiments proves that the chosen heuristic indexer can improve the efficiency of the web image searching on social bookmarking websites.},

abstract={In the field of Technology-enhanced Learning (TeL), social tagging has been applied to Learning Object Repositories (LORs) mainly as a means to offer an alternative way of classifying the LOs based on the tag vocabulary (i.e. the collection of tags created by the end-users of the LOs). Nevertheless, in order to be able to understand how a social tagging system performs and whether it can deliver the aforementioned goal, it is important to be able to investigate the behaviour of the tag vocabulary, which constitutes the core component of a social tagging system. Within this context, many studies have been conducted regarding the growth of the tag vocabularies of social tagging systems but there are only sporadic studies for investigating this issue in the field of LORs. This paper aims to contribute in studying how social tagging systems perform in the context of LORs by investigating tag vocabulary growth in OpenScienceResources Repository, a Science Education domain-specific repository with a rich dataset operating in Europe for 5 years. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Co-tagging refers to the process of adding the same tag to one or more digital resources by two or more taggers. This process can be modelled as a social network, also known as co-tagging network, where the actors are the taggers and the relationships between them are the common tags that they have used. Co-tagging networks have been studied by applying social network analysis (SNA) metrics so as to: (a) draw significant insights about the influence of central users to the (tagging) behaviour of other users and (b) identify clusters of taggers based on the content of the tags that they use. Nevertheless, there are no previous works, which have studied co-tagging networks in the field of Learning Object Repositories (LORs). In this paper we aim to address this issue by studying the co-tagging network of a specific LOR, namely the OpenScienceResources (OSR) Repository. © 2016 IEEE.},

Since each user has his/her own understanding and point of view of a given document, we propose an approach in which the index model provides a Personalized Social Document Representation (PerSaDoR) of each document per user based on his/her activities in a social tagging system. The proposed approach relies on matrix factorization to compute the PerSaDoR of documents that match a query, at query time. The complexity analysis shows that our approach scales linearly with the number of documents that match the query, and thus, it can scale to very large datasets. PerSaDoR has been also intensively evaluated by an offline study and by a user survey operated on a large public dataset from deliciousshowing significant benefits for personalized search compared to state of the art methods. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

In recent work, user behavior in social tagging systems was studied, that is, how users assign tags, and consume content. However, it is still unclear how users make use of the navigation options they are given. Understanding their behavior and differences in behavior of different user groups is an important step towards assessing the effectiveness of a navigational concept and improving it to better suit the users' needs. In this work, we investigate navigation trails in the popular scholarly social tagging system BibSonomy from six years of log data. We discuss dynamic browsing behavior of the general user population and show that different navigational subgroups exhibit different navigational traits. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that the semantic nature of the underlying folksonomy is an essential factor for explaining navigation. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={With the rapid growth of social tagging systems, many efforts have been put on tag-aware personalized recommendation. However, due to uncontrolled vocabularies, social tags are usually redundant, sparse, and ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach to solve this problem by mapping both the tag-based user and item profiles to an abstract deep feature space, where the deep-semantic similarities between users and their target items (resp., irrelevant items) are maximized (resp., minimized). Due to huge numbers of online items, the training of this model is usually computationally expensive in the real-world context. Therefore, we introduce negative sampling, which significantly increases the model's training efficiency (109.6 times quicker) and ensures the scalability in practice. Experimental results show that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in tag-aware personalized recommendation: e.g., its mean reciprocal rank is between 5.7 and 16.5 times better than the baselines. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Massive amounts of data are available on social websites, therefore finding the suitable item is a challenging issue. According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user’s preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={Social media platforms allow users to annotate photos with tags that significantly facilitate an effective semantics understanding, search, and retrieval of photos. However, due to the manual, ambiguous, and personalized nature of user tagging, many tags of a photo are in a random order and even irrelevant to the visual content. Aiming to automatically compute tag relevance for a given photo, we propose a tag ranking scheme based on voting from photo neighbors derived from multimodal information. Specifically, we determine photo neighbors leveraging geo, visual, and semantics concepts derived from spatial information, visual content, and textual metadata, respectively. We leverage high-level features instead traditional low-level features to compute tag relevance. Experimental results on a representative set of 203,840 photos from the YFCC100M dataset confirm that above-mentioned multimodal concepts complement each other in computing tag relevance. Moreover, we explore the fusion of multimodal information to refine tag ranking leveraging recall based weighting. Experimental results on the representative set confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts. © 2016 ACM.},

In contrast to current studies on group recommendation approaches that applied users-groups binary relations or users-tags-groups ternary relations, this work proposes a novel method named 4-order tensor reduction orthogonal iteration algorithm, which can recommend groups to users based on the consistent fusion of the items and tags information that exist in social tagging system. Four types of entities (users, tags, items, and groups) are integrated into a 4-order tensor recommendation framework, and then, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition and Higher Order Orthogonal Iteration methods are performed to reveal the latent semantic association among these entities and recommend groups to users. The results of our experiments on a Flickr dataset show that the proposed group recommendation approach outperforms certain popular methods that only based on users-groups binary relations or users-tags-groups ternary relations in terms of mean average precision (MAP). © 2016 IEEE.},

The user constantly has to zoom in by pinching the screen when reading on a small device. (4) It is not easy to navigate contents within an e-book because of the absence of an e-book linking feature. To tackle the above mentioned problems, we design and use an external domain-specific language (DSL) within our research. We propose a collaborative social tagging framework for e-books. The goals of this paper are (1) to define a model of an evolvable social resources taggable book (modeling of collaborative e-book), (2) to make readers read rich content e-book easily regardless of their type of devices as well as screen size. (Responsiveness), and (3) to provide e-book resources with the Representational State Transfer (RESTful) address style by which other systems can identify the self-descriptive resources of an e-books (interoperability). The experimental results show that e-book featured social tagging makes readers more interested in reading e-books rather than plain e-books. Further work includes user experience (UX) improvement, and a visual DSL approach with which the authors could write books easier. Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Tag relevance judgment is the foundation of tag application research and practice. Currently, tag relevance judgment strategies meet some problems in experiment effect and universality. To ameliorate both the effect and generalization of social tag relevance judgment strategies, this paper proposes a tag relevance judgment algorithm based on relative frequency. We verify this strategy by experiment based on 675 351 Douban Movie users' social tagging data. The results show that the effect of tag relevance judgment for tags whose frequencies are at least 5 performs well, for the recall is 84.16% and precision is 90.77%. We compare this strategy to the Top-N social tag relevance judgment strategy, and the result is obviously better than the Top-N strategy. Moreover, this strategy has good universality. It is suitable for various media such as video, audio, txt, image etc. Thus, it can be concluded that this strategy can solve tag relevance judgment problem well. © 2016, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

The new methods profile users using tag co-occurrence networks, upon which link-based node weighting methods (e.g. PageRank and HITS) are applied to refine the weights of tags. A diffusion process is then performed upon the tag-item bipartite graph to transform the weights of tags into recommendation scores for items. Experiments on three datasets showed improvements of the proposed method over the tag-based collaborative filtering in terms of precision and recall in the datasets with dense user-tag networks and in terms of inter-diversity in all datasets. In addition, the user-tag network is found to be a necessary instrument for the improvements.

abstract={Structuralized social tags can help improve the information organization and retrieval performances in social tagging systems. However, prior studies either applied manual approaches for tag structure analysis or employed automated tag classification methods based on thesaurus or syntax rules. To build a scalable yet reliable tag analysis framework, we combine thesaurus with syntax rule for automatic classification of tag types. Specifically, built on top of the prior studies, tags are firstly divided into three basic types-factual, subjective and personal. Then, we construct a thesaurus based on the metadata obtained from an online wiki and a social tagging system. At the same time, we also design a list of rules based on the syntactic structure of social tags. Finally, the rules and thesaurus are combined in one unified framework. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated based on a large-scale dataset with 675 351 Douban movies and their related social tags. The results suggest that the proposed method can be effectively used for automatic tag classification. © 2016, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University. All right reserved.},

The algorithm utilizes social tagging to contribute in increasing the quality for searching for places, services, and the discovering communities of the same interest. By exploiting social tagging, we propose a model which analyzes comments and feedback of posts published by users online. We demonstrate how the proposed algorithm can better utilize social information to improve the discovering of relevant items for a given user.

abstract={Social tagging systems have attracted plenty of research endeavors recently. The dynamic models of tag generation or tag usage are one of the key subjects of inquiry. However, the existing models do not well explain the “staged” power-law distribution of tag usage frequencies as observed in various social tagging systems. To cope with this, a new tag-generation model is proposed in this paper, which is based on a preferential selection mechanism influenced by the combinatorial effects of system recommendation and resource multidimensionality. Furthermore, to validate the model, the simulative results under different parameter combinations are compared with the distributions of tag usage frequencies in datasets from three famous social tagging systems, namely Delicious.com, Last.fm and Flickr. For different categories of resources of the three systems, three tag usage patterns can be identified, namely the power-law distribution with two plateaus, the power-law distribution with one plateau, and the standard power-law distribution. All the three patterns can be well fitted and explained by the proposed model. © 2016, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social tagging systems (STSs) allow users to annotate information items (songs, pictures, etc.) to provide them item/tag or even user recommendations. STSs consist of three main types of entities: 1) users; 2) items; and 3) tags. These data usually are represented by a three-order tensor, on which Tucker decomposition (TD) models are performed, such as higher order singular value decomposition. However, TD models require cubic computations for the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, TD models suffer from sparsity that incurs in social tagging data. Thus, TD models have limited applicability to large-scale datasets, due to their computational complexity and data sparsity. In this paper, we use two different ways to compute similarity/distance between tags (i.e., the term frequency - inverse document frequency vector space model and the semantic similarity of tags using the ontology of WordNet). Moreover, to reduce the size of the tensor's dimensions and its data sparsity, we use clustering methods (i.e., ${k}$ -means, spectral clustering, etc.) for discovering tag clusters, which are the intermediaries between a user's profile and items. Thus, instead of inserting the tag dimension in the tensor, we insert the tag cluster dimension, which is smaller and has less noise, resulting to better item recommendation accuracy. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithm with two real datasets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year.

abstract={Recommender systems have been widely used to discover users' preferences and recommend interesting items to users during this age of information overload. Researchers in the field of recommender systems have realized that the quality of a top-N recommendation list involves not only relevance but also diversity. Most traditional recommendation algorithms are difficult to generate a diverse item list that can cover most of his/her interests for each user, since they mainly focus on predicting accurate items similar to the dominant interests of users. Additionally, they seldom exploit semantic information such as item tags and users' interest labels to improve recommendation diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework which mainly adopts an expansion strategy of user interests based on social tagging information. The framework enhances the diversity of users' preferences by expanding the sizes and categories of the original user-item interaction records, and then adopts traditional recommendation models to generate recommendation lists. Empirical evaluations on three real-world data sets show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy and diversity of item recommendation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we study factors that inuence tag reuse behavior in social tagging systems. Our work is guided by the activation equation of the cognitive model ACT-R, which states that the usefulness of information in human memory depends on the three factors usage frequency, recency and semantic context. It is our aim to shed light on the inuence of these factors on tag reuse. In our experiments, we utilize six datasets from the social tagging systems Flickr, CiteULike, BibSonomy, Delicious, LastFM and MovieLens, covering a range of various tagging settings. Our results conrm that frequency, recency and semantic context positively inuence the reuse probability of tags. However, the extent to which each factor individually inuences tag reuse strongly depends on the type of folksonomy present in a social tagging system. Our work can serve as guideline for researchers and developers of tag-based recommender systems when designing algorithms for social tagging environments. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for social business process management (BPM) in which social tagging is used to capture process knowledge emerging during the design and enactment of the processes. Process knowledge concerns both the type of activities chosen to fulfil a certain goal and the skills and experience of users in executing specific tasks. This knowledge is exploited by recommendation tools to support the design and enactment of current and future process instances. Design/methodology/approach – The literature about traditional BPM is analysed to highlight the limitations of traditional BPM regarding management of ad hoc and semi-structured processes. Having identified this gap, an innovative BPM framework based on social tagging is proposed to address these limitations. This model is exemplified in a real case scenario and evaluated through the implementation of a prototype and a case study in real world non-profit organisation. Findings – An overview of the social BPM framework is presented, introducing the concepts of role and task recommendation, which are supported by social tagging. The prototype shows the buildability of the social BPM framework as an extension of a Wiki platform. The case study demonstrates that the social BPM framework improves user collaborativeness in designing and executing process instances. Research limitations/implications – The applicability of the framework is targeted to ad hoc and possibly semi-structured business processes and it does not extend to highly procedural and codified processes. A single case study limits the generalisability of the evaluation results. Originality/value – The social BPM framework is the first to introduce task and role recommendation supported by social tagging to overcome the limitations of traditional BPM models. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Several approaches have been researched to help people deal with abundance of information. An important feature pioneered by social tagging systems and later used in other kinds of social systems is the ability to explore different community relevance prospects by examining items bookmarked by a specific user or items associated by various users with a specific tag. A ranked list of recommended items offered by a specific recommender engine can be considered as another relevance prospect. The problem that we address is that existing personalized social systems do not allow their users to explore and combine multiple relevance prospects. Only one prospect can be explored atany given time-a listof recommended items, alistof items bookmarked by a specific user, or a list of items marked with a specific tag. In this article, we explore the notion of combining multiple relevance prospects as a way to increase effectiveness and trust. We used a visual approach to recommend articles at a conference by explicitly presenting multiple dimensions of relevance. Suggestions offered by different recommendation techniques were embodied as recommender agents to put them on the same ground as users and tags. The results of two user studies performed at academic conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces of personalized social systems. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection increase when users are able to explore and interrelate prospects of items relevance-that is, items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags. Nevertheless, a less-technical audience may require guidance to understand the rationale of such intersections. © 2016 ACM 2160-6455/2016/07-ART11 $15.00.},

abstract={With the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies, folksonomy which is also known as social tagging or collaborative tagging is widely used by learners to annotate and categorize their learning resources. In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Where previous reviews on content-based image retrieval emphasize what can be seen in an image to bridge the semantic gap, this survey considers what people tag about an image. A comprehensive treatise of three closely linked problems (i.e., image tag assignment, refinement, and tag-based image retrieval) is presented. While existing works vary in terms of their targeted tasks andmethodology, they rely on the key functionality of tag relevance, that is, estimating the relevance of a specific tag with respect to the visual content of a given image and its social context. By analyzing what information a specific method exploits to construct its tag relevance function and how such information is exploited, this article introduces a two-dimensional taxonomy to structure the growing literature, understand the ingredients of the main works, clarify their connections and difference, and recognize their merits and limitations. For a head-to-head comparison with the state of the art, a new experimental protocol is presented, with training sets containing 10,000, 100,000, and 1 million images, and an evaluation on three test sets, contributed by various research groups. Eleven representative works are implemented and evaluated. Putting all this together, the survey aims to provide an overview of the past and foster progress for the near future. © 2016 ACM.},

A researcher-made checklist prepared based on literature review and investigating four distinguished websites (Library Thing, Delicious, Amazon, and Google Books). Faced validity evaluated by 10 experts' viewpoints, then reliability calculated 0.87. Findings of this study are important because of two reasons: first, it provides a comprehensive and an unambiguous vision for recognizing basic capabilities and characteristics of user interfaces based on social bookmarking. Second, it can provide a base for designing digital libraries in Iran.

abstract={We analyze psychological dynamics of human-Web interaction exemplified by social tagging. Whereas previous models assumed tagging was driven by individual knowledge and social imitation, we introduce a reflective search framework that assumes user behavior (e.g., exploration and tagging of web resources) to arise from an iterative search of human memory shaped continuously by past and present learning episodes. We formalize this framework by means of a mathematical model of search of human memory which interrelates episodic and semantic memory processes. This allows us to simulate both temporal macro dynamics (stabilization of tag distribution) and underlying temporal micro dynamics (reflecting and tagging a resource). While the former are well covered by previous models, these models are not able to ex-plain the latter. We claim that shifting away from imitation to reflective search holds great potential for understanding and designing human web interaction more generally, and to validate models of human memory in large-scale web environments. © 2016 ACM.},

In order to solve these problems, a new user interest adaptive recommendation model is proposed, which efficiently combines exponential forgetting-based data weight and time windows. The new model not only highlights the importance of recent interest, but also stresses the recurring early data. The nearest neighbor set can be gained according to exponential offset tag vectors, and then make recommendations by calculating similarity between resource set of the nearest neighbors and that of the target user which is tipped within time windows. The simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm for recommendation has high quality of precision to some extent. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have established themselves as an important part in today's Web and have attracted the interest of our research community in a variety of investigations. Henceforth, several aspects of social tagging systems have been discussed and assumptions have emerged on which our community builds their work. Yet, testing such assumptions has been difficult due to the absence of suitable usage data in the past. In this work, we thoroughly investigate and evaluate four aspects about tagging systems, covering social interaction, retrieval of posted resources, the importance of the three different types of entities, users, resources, and tags, as well as connections between these entities' popularity in posted and in requested content. For that purpose, we examine live server log data gathered from the real-world, public social tagging system BibSonomy. Our empirical results paint a mixed picture about the four aspects. Although typical assumptions hold to a certain extent for some, other aspects need to be reflected in a very critical light. Our observations have implications for the understanding of social tagging systems and the way they are used on the Web. We make the dataset used in this work available to other researchers. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={This paper focuses on exploring the usage patterns and regularities of co-employment of various popular tags and their relationships with the activeness of users and the interest level of resources in social tagging. A hypernetwork for social tagging is constructed in which a tagging action is expressed as a hyperedge and the user, resource, and tag are expressed as nodes. Quantitative measures for the constructed hypernetwork are defined, including the hyperdegree and its distribution, the excess average hyperdegree, and the hyperdegree conditional probability distribution. Using the data set from Delicious, an empirical study was conducted. The empirical results show that multiple individual tags and one or very few popular tags are generally employed together in one tagging action, and the usage patterns and regularities of tags with varying popularity are correlated to both user activity and resource interest. The empirical results are further discussed and explained from the perspectives of tag functions and motivations. Finally, suggestions regarding the usage of various popular tags for both tagging users and service providers of social tagging are given. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={The rapid evolution of the Internet has been appealing for effective recommender systems to pinpoint useful information from online resources. Although historical rating data has been widely used as the most important information in recommendation methods, recent advancements have been demonstrating the improvement in recommendation performance with the incorporation of tag information. Furthermore, the availability of tag annotations has been well addressed by such fruitful online social tagging applications as CiteULike, MovieLens and BibSonomy, which allow users to express their preferences, upload resources and assign their own tags. Nevertheless, most existing tag-aware recommendation approaches model relationships among users, objects and tags using a tripartite graph, and hence overlook relationships within the same types of nodes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach, Trinity, to integrate historical data and tag information towards personalised recommendation. Trinity constructs a three-layered object-user-tag network that considers not only interconnections between different types of nodes but also relationships within the same types of nodes. Based on this heterogeneous network, Trinity adopts a random walk with restart model to assign the strength of associations to candidate objects, thereby providing a means of prioritizing the objects for a query user. We validate our approach via a series of large-scale 10-fold cross-validation experiments and evaluate its performance using three comprehensive criteria. Results show that our method outperforms several existing methods, including supervised random walk with restart, simulation of resource allocating processes, and traditional collaborative filtering. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose - While examining subject headings and tags is a popular research topic, most studies focus on comparing user-assigned tags and professional subject heading. Studies that compare Library of Congress Subject Headings to user-assigned tags, for instance, dominate the literature. However, little research has involved an examination on how and to what extent these features are actually used by library staff. This study adds to the body of knowledge. This study aims to focus on how librarians perceive and use tags. By focusing on people's perceptions rather than simply comparing social tags and formal subject headings, new insights can be collected. Design/methodology/approach - This research collects data through semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 library staff from various roles and locations throughout Auckland Libraries. Findings - The research findings show that while social tags have been adopted and used in their work by the majority of library staff interviewed, there remains resistance to using them. Some library staff preferred the traditional hierarchical subject headings found in the traditional catalogue. Ageneral lack of awareness about tag functions and features is also evident among the staff interviewed. Originality/value - The research focus is unique because it examines this phenomenon in a public library setting rather than in academic libraries, an area that is rarely examined in the literature. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social tagging is one of the most popular methods for collecting crowd-sourced information in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). However, when the number of social tags grows rapidly, using them becomes problematic and, as a result, they are often left as simply big data that cannot be used for practical purposes. To revitalize the use of this crowd-sourced information, we propose using social tags to link and cluster artworks based on an experimental study using an online collection at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art (GMoMA). We view social tagging as a folksonomy, where artworks are classified by keywords of the crowd's various interpretations and one artwork can belong to several different categories simultaneously. To leverage this strength of social tags, we used a clustering method called "link communities" to detect overlapping communities in a network of artworks constructed by computing similarities between all artwork pairs. We used this framework to identify semantic relationships and clusters of similar artworks. By comparing the clustering results with curators' manual classification results, we demonstrated the potential of social tagging data for automatically clustering artworks in a way that reflects the dynamic perspectives of crowds. © 2015 ASIS&T.},

Semantic priming occurs when an existing tag subconsciously primes the users mind to suggest semantically related tags. In an experiment, no such effect is found, in contrast to prior research. A follow-up study shows that whether semantic priming occurs depends on whether the person uses others previously created tags or is just passively exposed to them. The second type of influence, strategic choice, occurs in ESP-type settings. It refers to behavior in which a user chooses words that are semantically related to an existing tag in order to increase the chances of matching ones partner. Experimental results provide clear evidence of this strategic influence. In a follow-up study, we demonstrate that there is a meaningful difference in the tag sets that are created under the influence of strategic choice. Our work sheds light on the conditions and mechanisms through which existing tags influence subsequent tagging behavior. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Tagging (or bookmarking) online resources with representative keywords is one of the most popular and practical approaches for giving identity to the objects. Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD. CODer Entrepreneurs in the automatically formed communities can dynamically improve identity of the entrepreneurial objects related to their expertise or interests.},

abstract={Social tagging systems are widely applied in Web 2.0. Many users use these systems to create, organize, manage, and share Internet resources freely. However, many ambiguous and uncontrolled tags produced by social tagging systems not only worsen users’ experience, but also restrict resources’ retrieval efficiency. Tag clustering can aggregate tags with similar semantics together, and help mitigate the above problems. In this paper, we first present a common co-occurrence group similarity based approach, which employs the ternary relation among users, resources, and tags to measure the semantic relevance between tags. Then we propose a spectral clustering method to address the high dimensionality and sparsity of the annotating data. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed method is useful and efficient. © 2016, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Folksonomy is applied to items, such as music pieces, which their personalized tags can be annotated by users. Recommendation systems can use these tags to produce meaningful information. Clustering methods, such as the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) method, can be applied in the context of recommendation system. This paper proposes the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (IFAHC) algorithm for recommendation using social tagging. The Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) concept is used to represent tag values which are vague and uncertain. IFAHC can cluster items represented by using IFS into different groups.

Recommender Systems (RS) helps in alleviating this overloading problem and gaining the exact information what we need. RS suggest user items or products based on their browsing or purchasing history. RS suggest list of items by identifying similar users with explicit user-item rating. But, in real time applications most users do not rate items. In current web (2.0) social tagging applications help us to find useritem ratings implicitly based on the user's interest and preferences they give for the list of items. In this paper we have proposed a model based resource recommendation on social tagging information which has improved the performance of the RS. In the proposed system the topic is identified from the tagged data, based on the topic user profile is constructed by semantic approach and the recommendation is done for the user.},

abstract={Web 2.0 has brought many collaborative and novel applications which transformed the web as a medium and resulted in its exponential growth. Tagging systems are one of these killer applications. Tags are in free-form but represent the link between objective information and users’ cognitive information. However, tags have ambiguity problem reducing precision. Hence search and retrieval pose a challenge on folksonomy systems which have flat, unstructured, non-hierarchical organization with unsupervised vocabulary. We present a brief survey of different approaches for adding semantics in folksonomies thus bringing structure and precision in search and navigation. We did comparative analysis to estimate the significance of each source of semantics. Then, we have categorized the approaches in a systematic way and summarized the feature set support. Based on the survey we end up with recommendations. Our survey and conclusion will prove to be relevant and beneficial for engineers and designers aiming to design and maintain well structured folksonomy with precise search and navigation results. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Firstly tags clusters are generated based on the weight and similarity of tags, which is the preprocessing of tags. Secondly the attribute vectors of nodes in resources are tested and calculated and then according to the pre-programmed threshold value the corresponding clustering sub-graphs join in order to increase the contact edge of nodes. Finally a related comparative test is made between fuzzy clustering algorithm, k-means algorithm and algorithm proposed in this paper. The data is a top250 data set from Douban reading.

These images of everyday medical situations help the public understand the first-hand situation of those dramatic events, and facilitate the medical professionals to allocate medical resources and effectively diagnose. However, as the world is becoming more globalized and the communication between physician and patients is becoming more difficult as the healthcare practice becomes more complex, to be able to more effectively retrieval these user-generated images scattered throughout the Internet is of great importance. Social tagging is one such approach of managing and discovering photos for specific use. In response to the research gap and practical challenges, this study employs between-subject quasi-experiment method to investigate the tagging behavior of users of images of everyday medical situations. It aims to identify the differences of image tagging behaviors between two socially distinct groups, medical professionals and non-medical professionals.

abstract={In this paper, we focus on applying sentiment analysis to resources from online art collections, by exploiting, as information source, tags intended as textual traces that visitors leave to comment artworks on social platforms. We present a framework where methods and tools from a set of disciplines, ranging from Semantic and Social Web to Natural Language Processing, provide us the building blocks for creating a semantic social space to organize artworks according to an ontology of emotions. The ontology is inspired by the Plutchik's circumplex model, a well-founded psychological model of human emotions. Users can be involved in the creation of the emotional space, through a graphical interactive interface. The development of such semantic space enables new ways of accessing and exploring art collections. The affective categorization model and the emotion detection output are encoded into W3C ontology languages. This gives us the twofold advantage to enable tractable reasoning on detected emotions and related artworks, and to foster the interoperability and integration of tools developed in the Semantic Web and Linked Data community. The proposal has been evaluated against a real-word case study, a dataset of tagged multimedia artworks from the ArsMeteo Italian online collection, and validated through a user study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: Social media, mobile and wearable technology, and connected devices have significantly expanded the opportunities for conducting biomedical research online. Electronic consent to collecting such data, however, poses new challenges when contrasted to traditional consent processes. It reduces the participant-researcher dialogue but provides an opportunity for the consent deliberation process to move from solitary to social settings. In this research, we propose that social annotations, embedded in the consent form, can help prospective participants deliberate on the research and the organization behind it in ways that traditional consent forms cannot. Furthermore, we examine the role of the comments' valence on prospective participants' beliefs and behavior. Objective: This study focuses specifically on the influence of annotations' valence on participants' perceptions and behaviors surrounding online consent for biomedical research. We hope to shed light on how social annotation can be incorporated into digitally mediated consent forms responsibly and effectively. Methods: In this controlled between-subjects experiment, participants were presented with an online consent form for a personal genomics study that contained social annotations embedded in its margins. Individuals were randomly assigned to view the consent form with positive-, negative-, or mixed-valence comments beside the text of the consent form. We compared participants' perceptions of being informed and having understood the material, their trust in the organization seeking the consent, and their actual consent across conditions. Results: We find that comment valence has a marginally significant main effect on participants' perception of being informed (F2=2.40, P=.07); specifically, participants in the positive condition (mean 4.17, SD 0.94) felt less informed than those in the mixed condition (mean 4.50, SD 0.69, P=.09). Comment valence also had a marginal main effect on the extent to which participants reported trusting the organization (F2=2.566, P=.08). Participants in the negative condition (mean 3.59, SD 1.14) were marginally less trusting than participants exposed to the positive condition (mean 4.02, SD 0.90, P=.06). Finally, we found that consent rate did not differ across comment valence conditions; however, participants who spent less time studying the consent form were more likely to consent when they were exposed to positive-valence comments. Conclusions: This work explores the effects of adding a computer-mediated social dimension, which inherently contains human emotions and opinions, to the consent deliberation process. We proposed that augmenting the consent deliberation process to incorporate multiple voices can enable individuals to capitalize on the knowledge of others, which brings to light questions, problems, and concerns they may not have considered on their own. We found that consent forms containing positive valence annotations are likely to lead participants to feel less informed and simultaneously more trusting of the organization seeking consent. In certain cases where participants spent little time considering the content of the consent form, participants exposed to positive valence annotations were even more likely to consent to the study. We suggest that these findings represent important considerations for the design of future electronic informed consent mechanisms.},

The activity of social tagging among researchers to organize the digital resources is an interesting study among information professionals. The one way of organizing the resources for future retrieval through these user-generated terms makes an interesting analysis by comparing them with professionally created controlled vocabularies. Here in this study, an attempt has been made to compare Ubrary of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) terms with IibraryThing social tags. In this comparative analysis, the results show that social tags can be used to enhance the metadata for information retrieval.

abstract={Gezi Park Protests are undoubtedly one of those recent mass protests occupying an important place in the global agenda. The protests were initially to oppose the construction of the 19th century Ottoman Artillery Barrack within the area of Gezi Park without reconstruction permit. Upon police's severe intervention to the tens of people keeping cave in the park to save the trees to be cut, the number of those who interacted with each other in social media increased rapidly, turning Gezi Park into a place for contrarian forces to unite. During the protests, all kinds of support, help and cooperation calls are made through social media. The solidarity in Gezi Park became apparent in social media content, showing a general attitude against every kind of discrimination. In this study, we argue whether the sexist discourse used by the protesters related to Gezi Park Protests has been reconstituted by the Twitter hashtags. The Twitter hashtags such as #kirmizilikadin (lady in red), #gazdanadam (gasman), #direnayol (resist ayol), #duranadam (standing man) have been studied, in the context of gender, by the technique of discourse analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods. People use social tagging with their own words in the way how they conceive the state. The study concludes that the Twitter hashtags on Gezi Park Protests emphasize the power and sovereignty of men while focusing on the appearance and body of women, who are commonly perceived to be an aesthetic object as indicated by the discourse analysis. Hence, this study provides a significant contribution to the field on how the actual attitude against sexual discrimination in Gezi Park Protests was reflected in social tagging.},

abstract={Purpose: Most studies pertaining to social tagging focus on one platform or platform type, thus limiting the scope of their findings. The purpose of this paper is to explore social tagging practices across four platforms in relation to cultural products associated with the book Casino Royale, by Ian Fleming. Design/methodology/approach: A layered and nested case study approach was used to analyse data from four online platforms: Goodreads, Last.fm, WordPress, and public library social discovery platforms. The top-level case study focuses on the book Casino Royale, by Ian Fleming and its derivative products. The analysis of tagging practices in each of the four online platforms is nested within the top-level case study. Casino Royale was conceptualized as a cultural product (the book), its derived products (e.g. movies, theme songs), as well as a keyword in blogs. A qualitative, inductive, and context-specific approach was chosen to identify commonalities in tagging practices across platforms whilst taking into account the uniqueness of each platform. Findings: The four platforms comprise different communities of users, each platform with its own cultural norms and tagging practices. Traditional access points in the library catalogues focused on the subject, location, and fictitious characters of the book. User-generated content across the four platforms emphasized historical events and periods related to the book, and highlighted more subjective access points, such as recommendations, tone, mood, reaction, and reading experience. Revealing shifts occur in the tags between the original book and its cultural derivatives: Goodreads and library catalogues focus almost exclusively on the book, while Last.fm and WordPress make in addition cross-references to a wider range of different cultural products, including books, movies, and music. The analyses also yield apparent similarities in certain platforms, such as recurring terms, phrasing and composite or multifaceted tags, as well as a strong presence of genre-related terms for the book and music. Originality/value: The layered and nested case study approach presents a more comprehensive theoretical viewpoint and methodological framework by which to explore the study of user-generated metadata pertaining to a range of related cultural products across a variety of online platforms. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The effects of marketer-generated content (MGC) and user-generated content (UGC) on inducing consumers' responses have been widely studied as stand-alone main effects. Extending these research, this paper studies the interaction effects of consumers' endorsements on MGC and UGC posts in a social media brand community (SMBC) of a popular Asian fashion retailer. We examined if passive and active consumers' endorsements have enhancement effects on MGC/UGC and if they are also effective in inducing consumers' expenditure by themselves. Passive endorsement refers to "likes" on social network sites (SNS), while active endorsement refers to the more involved act of "commenting" on a post. We found evidence that active endorsements positively moderate the effects of MGC in inducing consumers' expenditure. However, passive endorsements negatively moderated MGC, making it less effective in inducing expenditure. Interestingly, the results were reversed for UGC whereby passive endorsements positively moderated UGC, while active endorsements negatively moderated UGC in inducing expenditure. Meanwhile, active endorsements through social-tagging on brand fans were found to be very effective, with recipients of social-tags spending $6 more than nonrecipients in a particular week. Additional robustness checks on selection bias were conducted, and results remain qualitatively similar.},

abstract={We have witnessed the popularity of photo sharing websites for people to share their own experiences by uploading personal photos. However, due the complexity of social tagging behaviors, user-supplied tags may be imprecise, incomplete, and even irrelevant to the image. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel social image tag ranking algorithm to sort tags according to their relevance to the image, which is of great importance for social image retrieval and semantic mining. Firstly, for a seed image, visually similar neighbors are collected from the social image dataset. Secondly, visually similar neighbors vote for each tag of the seed image, and the voting powers are weighted by both visual similarity and tag relevance. Thirdly, based on the neighbor voting results, ranking order of all tags is determined by implementing the random walk on tag graph. To testify the performance of the proposed algorithm, we collect social images from Flickr to construct a dataset which is made up of ten categories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms exiting methods, and it can effectively boost the performance of social image retrieval as well.},

abstract={Increasingly many social images with tags are available on photo sharing websites. Due to the subjectivity and diversity of social tagging behaviors, noisy and missing tags for images are inevitable. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel factor analysis model, named ProjecTive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (PTNMF) with ℓ2,1-norm regularization, which introduces linear transformation and ℓ2,1-norm minimization into a joint framework of NMF. For tagging data, a new interpretation is adopted to distinguish the relevant tags and irrelevant tags instead of the typically used binary scheme. In our model, the image latent representation is assumed to be projected from its original feature representation with an orthogonal transformation matrix. The projection makes convenient to embed any images including out-of-samples into the latent space. That is, the proposed method enables to handle the out-of-sample problem. The ℓ2,1-norm regularization makes the transformation matrix suitable for selecting the effective features. Local geometry preservations of image space (tag space) are explored as constraints in order to make image similarity (tag correlation) consistent in the original space and the corresponding latent space. We investigate the performance of the proposed method on image retrieval and compare it to existing work on the challenging NUS-WIDE dataset. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness and potentials of the proposed method in real-world applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Most of the OSS communities adopt a kind of categorization or tagging mechanism to organize the software. However, the categorization often too coarse, while the tags are flat and fail to capture the inter-relation among them. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reveal the latent relations between tags and build a tag hierarchy to help locate resources. We firstly build a co-occurrence network, based on which we compare the connotations of tags and construct a preliminary hierarchy. Then we leverage the domain knowledge of category in SourceForge to optimize and improve the relations between tags. At the end, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the constructed tag hierarchy with quantitative evaluation, which suggest the validation of our approach. © 2015 ACM.},

With this motivation, this paper presents results of a study where we focused on understanding (i) "when" to use the temporal information into traditional collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, and (ii) "how" to weight the similarity between users and items by exploring the effect of different time-decay functions. As the results of our extensive evaluation conducted over five social tagging systems (Delicious, BibSonomy, CiteULike, MovieLens, and Last.fm) suggest, the step (when) in which time is incorporated in the CF algorithm has substantial effect on accuracy, and the type of time-decay function (how) plays a role on accuracy and coverage mostly under pre-filtering on user-based CF, while item-based shows stronger stability over the experimental conditions.},

Our results suggest that the efficacy of an algorithm highly depends on the given needs and thus, they should be of interest to both researchers and developers in the field of tag-based recommender systems. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Social image tagging systems mostly suffer from poor performance for image retrieval due to the noisy and incomplete correspondences between user-contributed images and their associated tags. In this letter, we aim to refine tag allocations in the social tagging data provided by these systems. In particular, we propose to harness the tagged and untagged data with a two-stage strategy according to different types of data relations, i.e. item similarity defined by prior knowledge and item co-occurrence learned from data statistics. To solve the sparsity problem, we first introduce a new graph learning (GL) method for enriching the tagging data according to item similarities. Then, we develop a method of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for learning more coherent ternary relations among users, images and tags coupled by the manifold constraints learned from item co-occurrences. Experimental results with the tagging data from the NUS-WIDE dataset have been reported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the social annotation systems, users annotate digital data sources by using tags which are freely chosen textual descriptions. Tags are used to index, annotate and retrieve resource as an additional metadata of resource. Poor retrieval performance remains a major challenge of most social annotation systems resulting from several problems of ambiguity, redundancy and less semantic nature of tags. Clustering is a useful tool to handle these problems in social annotation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel tag clustering algorithm based on kernel information propagation. This approach makes use of the kernel density estimation of the kNN neighborhood directed graph as a start to reveal the prestige rank of tags in tagging data. The random walk with restart algorithm is then employed to determine the center points of tag clusters. The main strength of the proposed approach is the capability of partitioning tags from the perspective of tag prestige rank rather than the intuitive similarity calculation itself. Experimental studies on the six real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art clustering approaches in terms of various evaluation metrics. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This study demonstrates an improved conceptual foundation to support well-structured analysis of image topicality. First we present a conceptual framework for analyzing image topicality, explicating the layers, the perspectives, and the topical relevance relationships involved in modeling the topicality of art images. We adapt a generic relevance typology to image analysis by extending it with definitions and relationships specific to the visual art domain and integrating it with schemes of image-text relationships that are important for image subject indexing. We then apply the adapted typology to analyze the topical relevance relationships between 11 art images and 768 image tags assigned by art historians and librarians. The original contribution of our work is the topical structure analysis of image tags that allows the viewer to more easily grasp the content, context, and meaning of an image and quickly tune into aspects of interest; it could also guide both the indexer and the searcher to specify image tags/descriptors in a more systematic and precise manner and thus improve the match between the two parties. An additional contribution is systematically examining and integrating the variety of image-text relationships from a relevance perspective. The paper concludes with implications for relational indexing and social tagging. © 2015 ASIS&T.},

abstract={User-generated annotations in tagging or bookmarking sites such as Flickr or Delicious can provide a promising and interesting source of information for aiding tasks such as Web resource classification. However, the use of tags brings up some challenges. Since there are no constraints on the terms that can be used for tagging, noise and ambiguity are introduced when users annotate resources. Moreover, traditional bag-of-words representations ignore connections between terms and, thus, are affected by synonymity and hyponymia. Althougth tag-based representations are a valuable source for classifying resources, the problems associated with the unsupervised nature of tags may hinder classification results. This paper presents an approach for semantically analysing social annotations in order to attain enriched concept-based representations of Web resources. Representations are enriched with concepts extracted from WordNet and Wikipedia to overcome problems caused by natural language as well as enhancing the quality of information available for performing an effective classification of resources. Several strategies for tag pre-processing, concept disambiguation and incorporation of semantic entities to representations are discussed and evaluated in this paper. Experimental results showed that the strategies proposed to associate tags with conceptual entities allow improving resource classification results, outperforming traditional approaches based on bag-of-words representations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Introduction. One of the principal difficulties confronted by modern search engines is the overwhelming amount of, and lack of focus in, retrieved results. The goal of this study is identification and extraction of an assortment of diverse subtopics for the query and reduction and re-ranking of search results, according to the most prominent and discriminative subtopics. Method. Social tagging as a 'wisdom of crowds' source for characteristic query subtopics was employed. A new method for extraction of subtopics from social tags was devised. Three different ranking measures for query result are presented and comparatively evaluated. Analysis. We propose a new automatic methodology for evaluation of the quality of the extracted subtopics. For this purpose, we assess the minimal potential contribution of our approach to enhancement of query result ranking and focusing. The proposed methodology is based on standard information retrieval measures, such as precision, recall and the mean average precision. Results. The obtained results with the Google search engine and the Delicious social bookmarking site as a source of social tags indicate that the mean average precision of search results was improved after their filtering and re-ranking according to the subtopics extracted from social tagging. Conclusion. Social tags can be effectively utilized for query subtopics extraction. The quality of the subtopics can be automatically evaluated by their contribution to focusing and ranking query results. Query result representation can be improved by their selection and re-ranking according to the prominent social subtopics. © 2015, University of Sheffield. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the emergence of Web 2.0, tag recommenders have become important tools, which aim to support users in finding descriptive tags for their bookmarked resources. Although current algorithms provide good results in terms of tag prediction accuracy, they are often designed in a data-driven way and thus, lack a thorough understanding of the cognitive processes that play a role when people assign tags to resources. This thesis aims at modeling these cognitive dynamics in social tagging in order to improve tag recommendations and to better understand the underlying processes. As a first attempt in this direction, we have implemented an interplay between individual micro-level (e.g., categorizing resources or temporal dynamics) and collective macrolevel (e.g., imitating other users' tags) processes in the form of a novel tag recommender algorithm. The preliminary results for datasets gathered from BibSonomy, CiteULike and Delicious show that our proposed approach can outperform current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Collaborative Filtering, FolkRank or Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization. We conclude that recommender systems can be improved by incorporating related principles of human cognition.},

abstract={The lack of hierarchical relations in the tag space of social tagging systems may diminish the ability of users to find relevant resources. Many research works propose to overcome this problem by constructing hierarchies of tags automatically by means of heuristic algorithms. These hierarchies encode subsumption relations between pairs of tags and can be used for improving browsing and retrieval of resources. In this paper, we cast the problem of subsumption detection between pairs of tags as a pairwise classification problem. From the literature, we identified several similarity measures that are good indicators of subsumption, which are used as learning features. Under this setting, we observed severe class imbalance and class overlapping which motivated us to investigate and employ class imbalance techniques to overcome these problems. We conducted a comprehensive set of experiments on a large real-world dataset, showing that our approach outperforms the best performing heuristic-based baseline. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Social networks have become the main media for information dissemination in the so-called Web 2.0. The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging system has become a hot research topic due to the prevalence of Web2.0 during the past few years. These systems can provide users effective ways to collaboratively annotate and organize items with their own tags. However, the flexibility of annotation brings with large numbers of redundant tags. It is a very difficult task to find users’ interest exactly and recommend proper friends to users in social tagging systems. In this paper, we propose a Friend Recommendation algorithm by User similarity Graph (FRUG) to find potential friends with the same interest in social tagging systems. To alleviate the problem of tag redundancy, we utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to obtain users’ interest topics. Moreover, we propose a novel multiview users’ similarity measure method to calculate similarity from users’ interest topics, co-collected items and co-annotated tags. Then, based on the users’ similarities, we build user similarity graph and make interest-based user recommendation by mining the graph. The experimental results on tagging dataset of Delicious validate the good performance of FRUG in terms of precision and recall. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories.

abstract={The emerging of the Web 2.0 has allowed users more interactivity with Web applications. Social tagging has been recognized as an important solution to the description of resources available on the Web. In the context of elearning it may be used as an auxiliary mechanism to the composition of learning object metadata. This paper presents an approach based on the triplet of learners, learning objects and tags for providing the social tagging for e-learning. We performed an experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Although our results have shown that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning some challenges on how to implement it has to be overcome. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={With the development of Web 2.0, many websites allow users to create and manage their social tags. A lot of searches show that social annotations can be used to improve search quality, but the real tagging system is often sparse, uncategorized, lack of structure and of low quality, therefore traditional SimRank algorithm is so difficult to work. Introducing Jaccard index to SimRank algorithm, we put forward the improvement of social tagging Jaccard SimRank (JSR) similarity calculation method which automatically analyzes the similarity of user-input social annotations and expands them to increase the density. JSR algorithm can make full use of the information of social tagging to achieve effective retrieval and to describe similarity between any two tags intuitively. The experimental datasets come from bibsonomy website, and we have applied Jaccard index, SimRank and JSR algorithms against the test datasets. Experimental results show that the JSR algorithm is more effective in improving search quality than the traditional algorithms. © 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) poses a number of limitations for the management of ad-hoc processes, where the execution paths are not designed a priori and evolve during enactment. Social BPM, which predicates to integrate social software into the BPM lifecycle, has emerged as an answer to such limitations. This paper presents a framework for social BPM in which social tagging is used to capture process knowledge emerging during the enactment and design of the processes. Process knowledge concerns both the type of activities chosen to fulfil a certain goal and the skills and experience of users in executing specific tasks. Such knowledge is exploited by recommendation tools to support the design and enactment of future process instances. We first provide an overview of our framework, introducing the concepts of role and task recommendations, which are supported by social tagging. These mechanisms are then elaborated further by an example. Eventually, we discuss a prototype of our framework enabling collaborative process design and execution. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015},

abstract={Social tagging is a widespread phenomenon on the Web allowing users to tag resources, such as photos, by freely chosen labels. Imitation of other users' tagging behavior is deemed to increase the inter-individual consistency of tag assignments. Both verbatim and semantic mechanisms have been proposed where the first case suggests reuse of the exact words and the second reuse of the concept without necessarily the word form. Here, we present a multinomial model of assigning tags that integrates these perspectives. On the basis of the fuzzy-trace theory, the model includes separate parameters for the retrieval of verbatim and gist traces of encountered tags. Results of two experiments demonstrate that both types of memory traces contribute substantially and independently to tag productions. We conclude that the imitation of tags may be explained within one fuzzy-trace framework that contributes to our understanding of emergent phenomena in social information systems. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Recommendation systems and content-filtering approaches based on annotations and ratings essentially rely on users expressing their preferences and interests through their actions, in order to provide personalised content. This activity, in which users engage collectively, has been named social tagging, and it is one of the most popular opportunities for users to engage online, and although it has opened new possibilities for application interoperability on the semantic web, it is also posing new privacy threats. In fact, it consists in describing online or offline resources by using free-text labels, i.e., tags, thereby exposing a user's profile and activity to privacy attacks. As a result, users may wish to adopt a privacy-enhancing strategy in order not to reveal their interests completely. Tag forgery is a privacy-enhancing technology consisting in generating tags for categories or resources that do not reflect the user's actual preferences too accurately. By modifying their profile, tag forgery may have a negative impact on the quality of the recommendation system, thus protecting user privacy to a certain extent but at the expenses of utility loss. The impact of tag forgery on content-based recommendation isconsequently investigated in a real-world application scenario where different forgery strategies are evaluated, and the resulting loss in utility is measured and compared. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Nowadays, most social Websites allow users to annotate resources (such as Web pages and images) with keywords, i.e. tags. Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Personalized microblog recommendations face challenges of user cold-start problems and the interest evolution of topics. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on a temporal interest evolution model and social tag prediction. Three matrices are first prepared to model the relationship between users, tags, and microblogs. Then the scores of the tags for each microblog are optimized according to the interest evolution model of tags. In addition, to address the user cold-start problem, a social tag prediction algorithm based on community discovery and maximum tag voting is designed to extract candidate tags for users. Finally, the joint probability of a tag for each user is calculated by integrating the Bayes probability on the set of candidate tags, and the top n microblogs with the highest joint probabilities are recommended to the user. Experiments using datasets from the microblog of Sina Weibo showed that our algorithm achieved good recall and precision in terms of both overall and temporal performances. A questionnaire survey proved user satisfaction with recommendation results when the cold-start problem occurred. © 2015, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to explore relationships between social tagging and key poststructuralist principles; to devise and construct an analytical framework through which key poststructuralist principles are converted into workable research questions and applied to analyse Librarything tags, and to assess the validity of performing such an analysis. The research hypothesis is that tagging represents an imperfect analogy for the poststructuralist project. Design/methodology/approach–Tags from LibraryThing and from a library OPAC were compared and constrasted with Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and publishers’ descriptions. Research questions derived from poststructuralism, asked whether tags destabilise meaning, whether and how far the death of the author is expressed in tags, and whether tags deconstruct LCSH. Findings–Tags can temporarily destabilise meaning by obfuscating the structure of a word. Meaning is destabilised, perhaps only momentarily, and then it is recreated; it might resemble the original meaning, or it may not, however any attempt to make tags useful or functional necessarily imposes some form of structure. The analysis indicates that in tagging, the author, if not dead, is ignored. Authoritative interpretations are not pervasively mimicked in the tags. In relation to LCSH, tagging decentres the dominant view, but neither exposes nor judges it. Nor does tagging achieve the final stage of the deconstructive process, showing the dominant view to be a constructed reality. Originality/value–This is one of very few studies to have attempted a critical theoretical approach to social tagging. It offers a novel methodological approach to undertaking analysis based on poststructuralist theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social Tagging System (STS) which is one of the content management techniques is widely adopted in the online content sharing service. Using STS, users can give any strings (tags) to contents as annotations. It is important to know the usage of tag statistics for accomplishing an effective database design and the information navigation. The frequency of tag usage as well as their dynamics are similar to the ones found in the natural language. It is possible to reproduce the branching process of the tag dynamics using a classical model called Yule-Simon process. Another characteristic aspect of tags is the tag co-occurrence generated from the simultaneous use of tags. Using the tag co-occurrence, STS is able to reconstitute the hierarchy of tags, and recommend the tag which is probably used next. However, Yule-Simon process does not consider the tag co-occurrence and thus how the tag co-occurrence is generated from the model like Yule-Simon has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we propose to expand the Yule-Simon process to model the tag co-occurrence. From the point of view of network hierarchy, we confirm the similarity in the structure of the tag co-occurrence with the empirical data obtained from a social network service called‘ RoomClip ’. The present result suggested that this simple model like extended Yule-Simon process generates the tag co-occurrence feature. © 2015 Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.},

Social elements present in social BPM from one hand and the rigid sequential workflows in traditional BPM systems from another hand had made it difficult to have a full understanding of what social BPM really means, until recently where goal-oriented approach was introduced to overcome this contradiction. One of the main characteristics of social business process management is its inherent collaborative nature during all of its phases starting from the design stage all the way to the execution and improvement phase. This paper aims to provide a model for social BPM in which the post execution tagging of business processes logs is utilised by a process management system to assist future process participants with recommendations for task execution and role assignment. It is believed that this approach will lead to a truly socially driven business process management system where there is transparent and continuous participation of the users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Experimental results using pros and cons from five heterogeneous product groups show, that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches to group pros and cons from short texts.

Because queried keywords represent user's intentions, we believed they provide a better foundation for clustering methods.The experimental results show that the average precision and recall values of clustering methods based on queried keywords perform better than those of using social tagging and keywords extracted from whole articles. In addition, FCA+HAC using queried keywords outperforms other studied methods. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={An important way to improve users' satisfaction in Web search is to assist them by issuing more effective queries. One such approach is query reformulation, which generates new queries according to the current query issued by users. A common procedure for conducting reformulation is to generate some candidate queries first, then a scoring method is employed to assess these candidates. Currently, most of the existing methods are context based. They rely heavily on the context relation of terms in the history queries and cannot detect and maintain the semantic consistency of queries. In this article, we propose a graphical model to score queries. The proposed model exploits a latent topic space, which is automatically derived from the query log, to detect semantic dependency of terms in a query and dependency among topics. Meanwhile, the graphical model also captures the term context in the history query by skip-bigram and n-gram language models. In addition, our model can be easily extended to consider users' history search interests when we conduct query reformulation for different users. In the task of candidate query generation, we investigate a social tagging data resource-Delicious bookmark-to generate addition and substitution patterns that are employed as supplements to the patterns generated from query log data. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The relationship between technology and scholars is changing, along with the definition of technology (information technology, ICT, instructional technology) and its applications in academia and in research (Zhang,). While technology advances at a rapid pace, the sources of barriers and boundaries to extensive adoption in the humanities have remained the same. This panel brings together student, faculty, and professional speakers to examine key topics related to the role of information and technology in the development of research practices for, and about, the arts and humanities. Two core themes will be examined: 1) the importance of collaborative, cross-disciplinary programs, and, 2) the visibility afforded by technology and technology-based engagement allowing greater “impact” in arts and humanities disciplines. Within this context, panelists will discuss a collaborative interactive exhibit of library data, image classification of library collections using Flickr, engagement with digital methods, and an examination of altmetrics and current trends in research assessment. The current and potential impact of information and technology within the context of the arts and humanities is profound. Given the focus on cultural impediments and the need to foster a core set of e-based traditions in many disciplines, additional examination of the themes of collaboration and impact will help to define the continued importance of this topic within ASIS&T. Additionally, this panel responds to the need of information professionals and humanists for practical, implementable techniques to disrupt tradition and integrate information technology in new ways.

abstract={Designers of systems with knowledge building purposes (learning platforms, serious games, etc.) are increasingly, sometimes inadvertently, using strategies like collaboration (Wikis), social networking, and Gamification. They aim to engage people and help them evolve their knowledge through several forms of interaction (sharing, commenting, editing, liking, replying, tagging, etc.). Given this scenario, the present work analyzed the impact of a collaborative, tag-based content categorization mechanism in user's perception of knowledge building in a social bookmarking service. To achieve this we performed a statistical analysis based on usage log data recorded from the tagging interactions and a post-usage online survey with 84 responses. Although the user interaction with content (tagging) would suggest higher levels of learning, the results showed that the perception of knowledge building is not affected by user participation behavior, and lurkers and posters could equally benefit from the service. © 2015.},

Moreover, connections can be created between users that share the same interests. In our work, we intend to analyze the hashtags entered by users: the use of such hashtags, as it happens in other social networks like Twitter, generates a folksonomy, that is a user-driven classification of information. We intend to map that folksonomy as a complex network to which we can associate all the typical analysis and evaluations of such a mathematical model. Our purpose is to use the resulting complex network as a marketing tool, in order to improve brand or product awareness. Copyright © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Recommender systems, which provide users with recommendations of content suited to their needs, have received great attention in today's online business world. However, most recommendation approaches exploit only a single source of input data and suffer from the data sparsity problem and the cold start problem. To improve recommendation accuracy in this situation, additional sources of information, such as friend relationship and user-generated tags, should be incorporated in recommendation systems. In this paper, we revise the user-based collaborative filtering (CF) technique, and propose two recommendation approaches fusing usergenerated tags and social relations in a novel way. In order to evaluate the performance of our approaches, we compare experimental results with two baseline methods: user-based CF and user-based CF with weighted friendship similarity using the real datasets (Last.fm and Movielens). Our experimental results show that our methods get higher accuracy. We also verify our methods in cold-start settings, and our methods achieve more precise recommendations than the compared approaches.

abstract={Content-based filtering is widely used in music recommendation field. However, the performance of existing content-based methods is dissatisfactory, because those methods simply divided the listened songs into like or unlike set, and ignored user’s preference degree. In this paper, an enhanced content-based music recommending method was proposed by quantifying the user preference degree to songs with weighted tags. Firstly, each listened song was classified into like or unlike set according to user’s playing behaviors, such as skipping and repeating. Secondly, the songs’ social tags were collected from LastFm website and weighted according to their frequency in the collected tags.Finally, the user’s preference degree for each song was quantified with the weighted tags, and the candidate songs with high preference degrees would be recommended to him. On the LastFm dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms those traditional content-based methods in both rating and ranking prediction. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={E-learning is emerging as a popular approach of education in the workplace by virtue of its flexibility to access, just-in-time delivery, and cost-effectiveness. To improve social interaction and knowledge sharing in e-learning, Web 2.0 is increasingly utilized and integrated with e-learning applications. A basic challenge of Web 2.0 is the way that an impossible quantity of data has been generated over a short period. Social Tagging is one of the significant characteristics of Web 2.0. Tags are widely used to organize the web 2.0 Resources. Clustering the tag data is outstandingly troubling since the tag space is huge in a couple of social Tagging Systems. Tag Clustering is the processofgrouping the relative Tags into clusters. The Tag Clustering is genuinely useful for understanding and organizing the web 2.0 Resources. In this paper, the Clusteringtechnique is applied to the Social E-Learning Tagging System.Hybrid Covering Rough Set Based Particle Swarm Optimization (CRS-PSO) Algorithm is proposed in this work for clustering Tags and compared with benchmark clustering approaches like K-Means and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The exploratory examination of the proposed approach is illustrated based on cluster validation measures. © 2015, Research India Publications.},

abstract={With the growing amount of social media contents, the user needs more accurate information that reflects his interests. We focus on deriving user's profile and especially user's interests, which are key elements to improve adaptive mechanisms in information systems (e.g. recommendation, customization). In this paper, we are interested in studying two approaches of user's profile derivation from egocentric networks: individual-based approach and community-based approach. As these approaches have been previously applied in a co-author network and have shown their efficiency, we are interested in comparing them in the context of social annotations or tags. The motivation to use tagging information is that tags are proved relevant by many researches to describe user's interests. The evaluation in Delicious social databases shows that the individual-based approach performs well when the semantic weight of user's interests is taken more in consideration and the community-based approach performs better in the opposite case. We also take into consideration the dynamic of social tagging networks. To study the influence of time in the efficiency of the two user's profile derivation approaches, we have applied a time-awareness method in our comparative study. The evaluation in Delicious demonstrates the importance of taking into account the dynamic of social tagging networks to improve effectiveness of the tag-based user profiling approaches.

Interpretation is an educational process that aims to reveal meanings and values that lie behind the facts and objects. Interpretation that does not enables interaction among visitor and resource is sterile.

Using a designbased research methodology, we instantiated an orchestrational framework that included the use of social tagging and metadata. Additionally, we devised intelligent agents to support the enactment of our collaborative inquiry scripts. We identify three important structural dimensions for which intelligent agents can play a key role in the orchestration of such curricula: Content Agents, Activity Structure Agents, and Grouping Agents.

abstract={User profiling techniques play a central role in many Recommender Systems (RS). In recent years, multidimensional data are getting increasing attention for making recommendations. Additional metadata help algorithms better understanding users' behaviors and decisions. Existing user/item profiling techniques for Collaborative Filtering (CF) RS in multidimensional environment mostly analyze data through splitting the multidimensional relations. However, this leads to the loss of multidimensionality in user-item interactions; whereas the interactions are naturally multidimensional since users' choices are often affected by contextual information. In this paper, we propose a unified profiling approach which models users/items with latent higher-order interaction factors. We demonstrate that the proposed profiling approach is intimately related to two-dimensional profiling based on Matrix Factorization techniques. We further propose to integrate the profiling approach into three neighborhood-based CF recommenders for item recommendation. Finally, we empirically show on realworld social tagging datasets that the proposed recommenders outperform state-of-the-art CF recommendation approaches in accuracy.},

abstract={We assume that recommender systems are more successful, when they are based on a thorough understanding of how people process information. In the current paper we test this assumption in the context of social tagging systems. Cognitive research on how people assign tags has shown that they draw on two interconnected levels of knowledge in their memory: on a conceptual level of semantic fields or LDA topics, and on a lexical level that turns patterns on the semantic level into words. Another strand of tagging research reveals a strong impact of time-dependent forgetting on users’ tag choices, such that recently used tags have a higher probability being reused than “older” tags. In this paper, we align both strands by implementing a computational theory of human memory that integrates the two-level conception and the process of forgetting in form of a tag recommender. Furthermore, we test the approach in three large-scale social tagging datasets that are drawn from BibSonomy, CiteULike and Flickr. As expected, our results reveal a selective effect of time: forgetting is much more pronounced on the lexical level of tags. Second, an extensive evaluation based on this observation shows that a tag recommender interconnecting the semantic and lexical level based on a theory of human categorization and integrating time-dependent forgetting on the lexical level results in high accuracy predictions and outperforms other wellestablished algorithms, such as Collaborative Filtering, Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization, FolkRank and two alternative time-dependent approaches. We conclude that tag recommenders will benefit from going beyond the manifest level of word co-occurrences, and from including forgetting processes on the lexical level. ©Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015},

abstract={Introduction. This study examines the structure of Web space in the field of library and information science using multivariate analysis of social tags from the Website, Delicious.com. A few studies have examined mathematical modelling of tags, mainly examining tagging in terms of tri-partite graphs, pattern tracing and descriptive statistics. This study is one of the few studies to employ multivariate analysis in investigating dimensions of Web spaces based on social tagging data. Method. This study examines the post data collected from a set of library and information science related Websites bookmarked on Delicious.com using a Web crawler. Post data consist of the URL, usernames, tags and comments assigned by users of Delicious.com. The collected tag data were analysed based on multivariate methods, such as multidimensional scaling and structural equation modelling. Analysis. Collected data were first analysed using multidimensional scaling to explore initial relationships amongst the selected Websites. Then, confirmatory factor analysis based on structural equation modelling was employed to examine the hierarchical structure of the library & information science Web space. Results. Social tag data exhibit different dimensions in the Web space of the library and information science field. In addition, social tags confirmed the hierarchical structure of the field by showing significantly stronger relationships between the sites with similar characteristics. That is, the structure of the tagging data shows similar connections to those present in the real world. Conclusions. This study suggests a new statistical approach in social tagging and Web space analysis studies. Tag information can be used to explain the hierarchical structure of a certain domain. Methodologically, this study suggests that structural equation modelling can be a compelling method to explore hierarchal structures of nodes on the Web space. © the author, 2015.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Recent years have witnessed a phenomenal growth of social sharing websites. These social sharing web sites host a large volume of geo-referenced and community contributed media resources. However, due to the size and inability of computers to understand the content of the images, it is inherently difficult to organize, browse or search these collections. The work proposed here addresses an interesting task of organizing these geo-referenced media on Flickr to generate visual and thematic summarization of specified geo-location. The major challenge is: how to use the unstructured and unrestricted community contributed media and annotations to generate knowledge? We propose the modified PLSA algorithm to generate representative sets of images and tags for given geo-location. We have used location metadata, tags associated with images, and the visual features of images to understand context and content of images. To deal with social tagging accuracy problem, we consider ternary interrelations and multiple intra-relations among user, image and tag and model the relations using HOSVD. The novel visualization scheme summarizes the geo-location with a rich display landscape and provides location description using location representative tags. Experiments are performed on geo-tagged Flickr images for various geo-locations. The experimental results have validated the proposed method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Social media has two essential building blocks: content and people. These two components form a heterogeneous network with various types of relations: people produce and share content, various content items are related to each other, and people have social relations such as collaboration and discussion. Identifying people’s expertise and topics is the first step in evaluating the quality of information in a network. Text semantic analysis and social network analysis address this issue from different perspectives. Text analysis aims at constructing concept similarity networks based on documents and keywords within the documents. Linguistics or keyword co-occurrence is used to detect word associations. Social network analysis utilizes network structures to find prestigious individuals who connect with other experts in a relational network. This study proposes a three-layer framework to integrate the semantic and social networks in order to reveal peoples expertise based on the words they use and their relations. Using social tagging activities on CiteUlike as an example, we illustrate how social relations help identify similar concepts in semantic networks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Therefore, we proposed a novel method to extract lines as a region as a geographical characterization. Results show that the distance of a coastline and many lines of our method is less than 500 m. Although, in this paper, only the coastline has been evaluated, this method is applicable to other tags as well. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Modeling social tagging plays a critical role in identifying statistical regularities and structural principles common to social tagging systems. Existing modeling approaches only consider imitations or background knowledge of users. However, common interests among users are ignored. In this paper, latent interactions are applied to present the common interests, and dynamic patterns in empirical data are investigated. Furthermore, the latent interaction driven model (LIDM) is proposed to model social tagging. Experimental results show that the tag frequency distribution generated by LIDM is consistent with that in real-world data. Moreover, the latent interaction graph generated by LIDM has a higher average clustering coefficient and lower average shortest path compared with that generated by preferential attachment methods. This demonstrates that LIDM outperforms traditional methods.© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays large-scale social tagging data have become very valuable in organizing and indexing multimedia resources. In this paper, we apply Non-negative Sparse Latent Semantic Analysis (NN-Sparse LSA) to discover the latent semantic space behind associations between multimedia resources and tagging data. Based on the traditional coordinate-descent algorithm, column-orthogonality and non-negative constraints, we derive a much faster optimization algorithm in theory for solving the NN-Sparse LSA model. Furthermore, we implement the parallel version of our fast NN-Sparse LSA algorithm using the NVIDIA CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel programming framework and a data partitioning scheme that effectively reduces the memory traffic between the global memory of the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and the host memory. The experimental results on image classification and tag recommendation tasks on MIRFLICKR and NUS-WIDE datasets show that our parallelized fast optimization algorithm can achieve comparable or even better performance than the other examined methods, while speeds up the original optimization algorithm 20-110 times. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Social tagging, also noted as collaborative tagging or folksonomy, is an important way for users themselves to describe resources on the Web. The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Social tagging is a widespread phenomenon on the Web allowing users to tag resources, such as photos, by freely chosen labels. Imitation of other users' tagging behavior is deemed to increase the inter-individual consistency of tag assignments. Both verbatim and semantic mechanisms have been proposed where the first case suggests reuse of the exact words and the second reuse of the concept without necessarily the word form. Here, we present a multinomial model of assigning tags that integrates these perspectives. On the basis of the fuzzy-trace theory, the model includes separate parameters for the retrieval of verbatim and gist traces of encountered tags. Results of two experiments demonstrate that both types of memory traces contribute substantially and independently to tag productions. We conclude that the imitation of tags may be explained within one fuzzy-trace framework that contributes to our understanding of emergent phenomena in social information systems. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This article investigates how the information contained in social tags can act as a proxy measure for brand performance and can predict the financial valuation of a firm. Using data collected from a social tagging and bookmarking website, Delicious, the authors examine social tagging data for 44 firms across 14 markets. After controlling for accounting metrics, media citations, and other user-generated content, they find that social tag-based brand management metrics capturing brand familiarity, favorability of associations, and competitive overlaps of brand associations can explain unanticipated stock returns. In addition, they find that in managing brand equity, it is more important for strong brands to enhance category dominance, whereas it is more critical for weak brands to enhance connectedness. These findings suggest a new way for practitioners to track, measure, and manage intangible brand equity; proactively improve brand performance; and influence a firm's financial performance. © 2014, American Marketing Association.},

abstract={In the social tagging system, users annotate different web resources according to their need of future information organization and retrieval, and users also annotate resources with different types of tags, such as objective tag, subjective tag, selforganized tag and so on. Because every web resource has its own characteristics, the tag types of each web resource are different. According to the web resource, the quality of each tag type is different. We should depend on resource types to evaluate the quality of tag types, in order to provide efficient tag recommendation service and design better user tagging interfaces. In this paper, we firstly selected five web resources, namely the blog, book, image, music and video, to explore the tag types when annotating different resources. Then we chose specific resource and tags to explore the quality of each tag type according to these five web resources and study the relationship between tag type and quality. The conclusion is that the quality of tag types for different web resources is different. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

abstract={Taggers in social tagging systems have the main role in giv- ing identities to the objects. Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects. Be- cause our perceptions in each specific area of knowledge is evolving over time, the goal of our approach is also to evolve the represented knowledge in semantic tagging systems dy- namically according to the latest perception of the related users. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

abstract={With the advent of the so-called "Web 2.0", the participatory nature of many of its applications has nurtured the vision of many researchers to finally overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck inherent to many Semantic Web applications. Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the characteristics of the co-occurrence network of online tags and propose new approaches of applying social network analysis by utilising social tagging in order to organise data. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected online resources labelled "tag" from 7 November 2004 to 31 October 2011 from the CiteULike website, comprising 684 papers and their URLs, titles and data on tagging (users, times, and tags). They examined the co-occurrence network of online tags by using the analyses of social networks, including the analysis of coherence, the analysis of centricity and core to periphery categorical analysis. Findings: Some features of the co-occurrence of online tags are as follows: the internet is subject to the "small world" phenomenon, as well as being "scale-free". The structure of the internet reflects stable areas of core knowledge. In addition to five possible applications of social network analysis, social tagging has the greatest significance in organising online resources. Originality/value: This research finds that co-occurrence of tags online is an effective way to organise and index data. Some suggestions are provided on the organisation of online resources. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 1468-4527.},

abstract={Large image collections on the Web need to be organized for effective retrieval. Metadata has a key role in image retrieval but rely on professionally assigned tags which is not a viable option. Current contentbased image retrieval systems have not demonstrated sufficient utility on large-scale image sources on the web, and are usually used as a supplement to existing text-based image retrieval systems. We present two social tagging alternatives in the form of photo-sharing networks and image labeling games. Here we analyze these applications to evaluate their usefulness from the semantic point of view, investigating the management of social tagging for indexing The findings of the study have shown that social tagging can generate a sizeable number of tags that can be classified as interpretive for an image, and that tagging behaviour has a manageable and adjustable nature depending on tagging guidelines.},

abstract={Online social networking services (SNS) have been regarded as one of the most powerful online communication channels to propagate information to other users. It means that the online social networking services are providing users with efficient features (e.g., searching, managing and visualizing new information). It is important for many online collaborative applications to understand how the information can be propagated via such social media. Thus, we want to focus on a social tagging system (e.g., Flickr) where users can easily exchange resources as well as their tags. In this paper, given a certain tag, a social pulse can be established by counting (i) the number of users and (ii) the number of resources over time. More importantly, we assume that information can be propagated by (iii) inducibility from other tags by comparing social pulses. To conduct experimentation, a tag-based searching system (called Tagoole) has been implemented to collect a dataset from Flickr. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The emerging Web 2.0 applications have allowed new ways of characterizing digital educational resources, which moves from the expert-based descriptions relying on formal classification systems such as the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (LOM) to a less formal user-based tagging. This alternative way of characterizing digital educational resources is commonly referred to as social tagging, whereas the collection of tags created by the different users individually is referred to as folksonomy. As a result, a number of studies have been reported in the field of Technology-enhanced Learning (TeL) which provide evidence that social tagging has the potential to enlarge metadata descriptions, as well as the formal structured vocabularies with additional terms derived by the resulted folksonomy but more in depth studies are needed regarding this enlargement process. Thus, one issue to investigate further is the possible influence of users' tagging motivation to the resulted enlarged metadata descriptions. In this paper we aim to investigate this issue by first proposing a methodology that aims to evaluate whether users' tagging motivation can influence (a) the enlargement of educational resources possible descriptions compared to the anticipated creators' descriptions and (b) the resulted folksonomy compared with formal structured vocabularies used by the creators of the educational resources and then, apply it to an existing LOR with more than 3,000 science education resources, 434 taggers and 14,707 social tags. Our experiments provided evidence that taggers with a specific type of tagging motivation can produce tags that are significantly different from formal metadata generated by the creators of the educational resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recommender Systems (RS) improves users' shopping experience by by recommending them a shopping item. Many techniques have been introduced to enhance RS algorithms, including social tagging. Social Tagging let users share resources and this lead to more personalized recommendation. There is a lack of overall information about RS algorithms that have implemented social tagging. Therefore, in this paper we compared and analysed some of the studies that have particularly used social tagging in recommender systems. Both Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-based filtering systems were compared, and results show that it is better to combine these algorithms for achieving higher personalized recommendation, and also to address the cold start issue. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Personalized recommendation is an effective method for fighting "information overload". However, its performance is often limited by several factors, such as sparsity and cold-start. Some researchers utilize user-created tags of social tagging system to depict user preferences for personalized recommendation, but it is difficult to identify users with similar interests due to the differences between users' descriptive habits and the diversity of language expression. In order to find a better way to depict user preferences to make it more suitable for personalized recommendation, we introduce a framework that utilizes item domain features to construct user preference models and combines these models with collaborative filtering (CF). The framework not only integrates domain characteristics into a personalized recommendation, but also aids to detecting the implicit relationships among users, which are missed by the conventional CF method. The experimental results show our method achieves the better result, and prove the user preference model is more effective for recommendation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Social tagging is a popular method that allows users of social networks to share annotation in the form of keywords, called tags, assigned to resources. Social tagging addresses information overload by easing the task of locating interesting entities in a social network. Nevertheless, users can still be overwhelmed by too many tags posted at each moment. A process is needed that offers an accurate overview of the representative entities and their relationships with each other, while dealing with the dynamics of social tagging and of tags' semantics. We propose a method for the automated summarization of an evolving multi-modal social network, focusing on the entities that stay representative over time for some subnetwork in the social tagging system. We report on experiments with real data from the Bibsonomy social tagging system, where we compare our dynamic approach with a static one. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Henceforth, several assumptions about social tagging systems have emerged on which our community also builds their work. Yet, testing such assumptions has been dificult due to the absence of suitable usage data in the past. In this work, we investigate and evaluate four assumptions about tagging systems by examining live server log data gathered from the public social tagging system BibSonomy. Our empirical results indicate that while some of these assumptions hold to a certain extent, other assumptions need to be reflected in a very critical light.

In this work we tackle these questions by (i) presenting a novel and robust method which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods, (ii) empirically investigating semantic stabilization processes in a wide range of social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties and (iii) detecting potential causes for semantic stabilization, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams which are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams which are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.

abstract={In the big data era, detecting unsupervised communities in a given dataset, analyzing the evolution of the unsupervised communities, tracing the interests of users are very important. For instance, we can capture user's interest and provide personalized information. In order to detect unsupervised communities in social tagging networks, this paper uses similarity cloud properties of cloud model to solve the different community analysis, classification, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities problems. Cloud model is used in this paper. By introducing similarity cloud properties of cloud model, cloud model can detect the unsupervised communities, describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively, and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities. For illustration, the proposed model is applied to Delicious dataset to detect unsupervised communities and one month is used as time slice to study the evolutions of the unsupervised communities. Empirical results show that the unsupervised community in social tagging in network, using Similarity cloud properties of cloud model can effectively detect different unsupervised communities, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively. Similarity cloud properties based cloud model can effectively detect unsupervised community in social tagging network, and quantitatively describe the evolutions of the community and community user' dynamic interest. Hence, CBUCD model is an efficient solution for detecting unsupervised community and analyzing evolutions. © 2013 IEEE.},

Our algorithm follows a two-step approach, where in the first step a potentially interesting candidate item-set is found using user-based CF and in the second step this candidate item-set is ranked using item-based CF. Within this ranking step we integrate the information of tag usage and time using the Base-Level Learning (BLL) equation coming from human memory theory that is used to determine the reuse-probability of words and tags using a power-law forgetting function. As the results of our extensive evaluation conducted on datasets gathered from three social tagging systems (BibSonomy, CiteULike and MovieLens) show, the usage of tag-based and time information via the BLL equation also helps to improve the ranking and recommendation process of items and thus, can be used to realize an effective item recommender that outperforms two alternative algorithms which also exploit time and tag-based information.},

abstract={A specialized query expansion consists of a set of keywords, which is used to reduce the size of search results in order to help users find the required data conveniently. The utility of a specialized query expansion represents the qualities of the top-N high quality objects matching the expansion. Given the search results of a keyword query on social tagging systems, we want to find k specialized query expansions with the highest utilities without redundancy. Besides, the discovered expansions are guaranteed to match at least N objects. We construct a tree structure, called an UT-tree, to maintain the tag sets appearing in the search results for generating the specialized query expansions. We first propose a depth-first approach to find the top-k high utility specialized query expansions from the UT-tree. For further speeding up this basic approach, we exploit the lower bound and upper bound estimations of utilities for a specialized query expansion to reduce the size of the constructed UT-tree. Only the tag sets of objects which are possibly decide the top-k high utility specialized query expansions need to be accessed and maintained. By applying this strategy, we propose another faster algorithm. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms work well on both the effectiveness and the efficiency. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={An increasing number of users interact, collaborate, and share information through social networks. Unprecedented growth in social networks is generating a significant amount of unstructured social data. From such data, distilling communities where users have common interests and tracking variations of users' interests over time are important research tracks in fields such as opinion mining, trend prediction, and personalized services. However, these tasks are extremely difficult considering the highly dynamic characteristics of the data. Existing community detection methods are time consuming, making it difficult to process data in real time. In this paper, dynamic unstructured data is modeled as a stream. Tag assignments stream clustering (TASC), an incremental scalable community detection method, is proposed based on locality-sensitive hashing. Both tags and latent interactions among users are incorporated in the method. In our experiments, the social dynamic behaviors of users are first analyzed. The proposed TASC method is then compared with state-of-the-art clustering methods such as StreamKmeans and incremental k-clique; results indicate that TASC can detect communities more efficiently and effectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, a novel method for personalized item recommendation based on social tagging is presented. The proposed approach comprises a content-based tag propagation method to address the sparsity and "cold start" problems, which often occur in social tagging systems and decrease the quality of recommendations. The proposed method exploits (a) the content of items and (b) users' tag assignments through a relevance feedbackmechanism in order to automatically identify the optimal number of content-based and conceptually similar items. The relevance degrees between users, tags, and conceptually similar items are calculated in order to ensure accurate tag propagation and consequently to address the issue of "learning tag relevance." Moreover, the ternary relation among users, tags, and items is preserved by performing tag propagation in the form of triplets based on users' personal preferences and "cold start" degree. The latent associations among users, tags, and items are revealed based on a tensor factorization model in order to build personalized item recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods, since several problems in social tagging systems are successfully tackled. Finally, we present the recommendation methodology in the multimodal engine of I-SEARCH, where users' interaction capabilities are demonstrated. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The rapidly increasing amount of user-generated content in social tagging systems provides a huge source of information. Yet, performing effective search in these systems is very challenging, especially when we seek the most appropriate items that match a potentially ambiguous query. Collaborative filtering-based personalization is appealing in this context, as it limits the search within a small network of participants with similar preferences. Offline personalization, which consists in maintaining, for every user, a network of similar participants based on their tagging behaviors, is effective for queries that are close to the querying user's tagging profile but performs poorly when the queries, reflecting emerging interests, have little correlation with the querying user's profile. We present P2TK2, the first protocol to personalize query processing in social tagging systems online. P2TK2 is completely decentralized, and this design choice stems from the observation that the evolving social tagging systems naturally resemble P2P systems where users are both producers and consumers. This design exploits the power of the crowd and prevents any central authority from controlling personal information. P2TK2 is gossip-based and probabilistic. It dynamically associates each user with social acquaintances sharing similar tagging behaviors. Appropriate users for answering a query are discovered at query time with the help of social acquaintances. This is achieved according to the hybrid interest of the querying user, taking into account both her tagging behavior and her query. Results are iteratively refined and returned to the querying user. We evaluate P2TK2 on CiteULike and Delicious traces involving up to 50,000 users. We highlight the advantages of online personalization compared to offline personalization, as well as its efficiency, scalability, and inherent ability to cope with user departure and interest evolution in P2P systems. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering systems consider users' social environment to predict what each user may like to visit in a social network i.e. they collect and analyze a large amount of information on users' behavior, activities or preferences and then predict or make suggestions to users. These systems use ranks or tags each user assign to different resources to make predictions. Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents, tag, organize, share and search for contents, are becoming more popular. These social tagging systems have a lot of valuable information, but the data expansion in them is very fast and this has led to the need for recommender systems that will predict what each user may like or need make these suggestions to them. One of the problems in these systems is: 'how much can we rely on the similar users, are they trustworthy'. In this article we use trust metric, which we conclude from users' tagging behavior, beside similarities to give suggestions. Results show considering trust in a collaborative system can lead to better performance in generating suggestions. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommendation is a technique commonly adopted to address and mitigate the negative effect of information overload problem. Collaborative filtering recommendation technique is one the most successful and popular approaches. However, collaborative filtering approach only considers whether or not a user likes a specific resource but does not take into account the reason why she/he likes it. Social tagging systems, a well-known mechanism in various Web 2.0 applications, play a crucial role to deal with this issue. In response, some prior studies have tried to incorporate social tagging systems into traditional recommendation approaches to enhance their performance. In this study, we investigate the effect of tag completeness in tag-based recommendation approach by proposing a tag-expansion-based personalized recommendation (TE-PR) technique to enrich user profiles and resource profiles. According to our empirical evaluation results using CiteULike data set, the tag-expansion-based approach indeed improves the performance of recommendation techniques. Moreover, the expanded resource profiles have significant positive contributions on recommendation performance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tag has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. It depicts the ternary relation of user using tags to annotate resources. Aim at the problem of the sparse user access data resulting in low efficiency of traditional user clustering algorithms in social tagging system, this paper proposes a iterative tripartite clustering algorithm, which first cluster tags, resources and users respectively,and then adjust the three groups of clusters into the stable status by the cross iteration according to the interactions of the three entities. So that the distances within the cluster are much smaller whereas the distances between the clusters are even bigger. Experiment shows that this method can effectively solve the data sparsity problem, and significantly outperform the traditional cluster algorithms. © 2014 by Binary Information Press},

abstract={Social tagging systems allow Internet users to annotate resources with tags. Internet is an open system, which permits users the freedom to explore tags. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag ambiguity hindering navigation. So, a key question is how to harvest tag semantics from these systems. We present an algorithm of hierarchical tag clustering. With this algorithm, we clustering the tags into a semantic tree, then we turn every resource item into an induced tree. We propose a new method for resource retrieval, which based on semantic similarity. We present extensive experimental results on a real world dataset. When we retrieve the resource based on semantic similarity, our algorithm shows the high recall and precision. Furthermore, our algorithm demonstrates more utility for recommendation. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Privacy preservation has gained importance with the development of tools for personal information retrieval and social information sharing in Web 2.0 environments. This paper addresses the need for a paradigm shift concerning publicity and privacy together in the process of personal information service and privacy preservation. In addition, we also bridge the conflict between interactivity and independency in the process of social sharing and privacy preservation. By analyzing the paradigm and conflict, we identify the criteria of privacy relativity, such as publicity vs. privacy and interactivity vs. independency. Using hierarchical clustering methods, we analyze the hierarchical community characteristics of tag networks which reflect users' preferences and the features of information resources through social tagging. Based on the hierarchical communities of tag networks and relevant parameters of partitions such as the k of k-clique and the number of communities N at a certain level, we can determine and adjust the degree and the scope of users' preferences and the features of information resources which can be revealed according to users' permissions. The adjustment process can reflect the trade-off between privacy preservation and information access. We believe that this work will prove to be an important first-step toward the personalization and socialization of security policies in Web 2.0 environments. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of applying the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) as an established knowledge organization system (KOS) for enhancing social tagging, with the ultimate purpose of improving subject indexing and information retrieval. Design/methodology/approach – Over 11,000 Intute metadata records in politics were used. Totally, 28 politics students were each given four tasks, in which a total of 60 resources were tagged in two different configurations, one with uncontrolled social tags only and another with uncontrolled social tags as well as suggestions from a controlled vocabulary. The controlled vocabulary was DDC comprising also mappings from the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Findings – The results demonstrate the importance of controlled vocabulary suggestions for indexing and retrieval: to help produce ideas of which tags to use, to make it easier to find focus for the tagging, to ensure consistency and to increase the number of access points in retrieval. The value and usefulness of the suggestions proved to be dependent on the quality of the suggestions, both as to conceptual relevance to the user and as to appropriateness of the terminology. Originality/value – No research has investigated the enhancement of social tagging with suggestions from the DDC, an established KOS, in a user trial, comparing social tagging only and social tagging enhanced with the suggestions. This paper is a final reflection on all aspects of the study. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

A challenge for recommendation is to represent and synthesize all useful aspects of a user’s profile. Typically, researchers focus on a limited set of relations (for example, person to person ties for user recommendation or annotations in social tagging recommendation). In this paper, we present a general approach to recommendation in heterogeneous networks that can incorporate multiple relations in a weighted hybrid. A key feature of this approach is the use of the metapath, an abstraction of a class of paths in a network in which edges of different types are traversed in a particular order. A user profile is therefore a composite of multiple metapath relations. Compared to prior work with shorter metapaths, we show that a hybrid composed of components using longer metapaths yields improvements in recommendation diversity without loss of accuracy on social tagging datasets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, such as Delicious1 and Flickr 2, users are allowed to annotate resources (e.g., Web URLs and images) with textual descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching, mining and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users, and as a result, most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources, while most of the resources receive few tags. Crucially, this incomplete tagging on resources can severely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag, an incentive-based tagging system, which aims at improving tagging quality of resources, by incentivizing taggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In our demonstration, we will show how our system allows users to use simple but powerful strategies to significantly improve the tagging quality of resources. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The abundance of educational resources available on the Web leads to information overload for the students and the difficulty in finding useful and relevant resources for a specific learning context. The solution that we propose in this paper is a platform called Edu3R (Educational Resources Retrieval and Recommendation), which relies on community filtering: students enrolled in the same course can perform collaborative search through various learning object repositories, bookmark the resources of interest, rate them and share them with peers. The rationale is that resources found and selected by peers are likely to be relevant since the learning community is centered around the same course and the same learning tasks and is relatively homogeneous (classmates generally having common learning backgrounds and completing the same curriculum). Edu3R also relies on social tagging, through which learners annotate resources with meaningful terms that reflect the educational context, provide a personalized classification and facilitate subsequent retrieval. Finally, Edu3R also integrates a collaborative filtering mechanism for recommending learning resources based on student similarity. The paper provides an overview of the system architecture, functionalities and pedagogical rationale, as well as a comparison with similar platforms. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three components, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this paper, we develop a dual mining framework to explore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design four sets of efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to present and compare so-called bottom-up and top-down approaches for evaluating quality and reusability of learning objects (LOs). The paper proposes bottom-up methodology that outlines the central role of learners' individual and social behaviour while working with LOs. This includes social tagging and some parameters of interaction for measuring context to describe LOs usage, attention, and other aspects of the context as well as helps to exploit context data towards making LOs repositories more useful, and thus enhance the reuse. The paper also presents top-down methodology for the expert evaluation of LOs quality and reusability. This methodology consists of consecutive application of several scientific approaches, methods, and principles. The authors investigate how these two different, however complimentary approaches for evaluating LOs quality and reusability can be better applied for the aims of eQNet project in order to select reusable ("travel well") LOs for implementing in different educational contexts and countries. These approaches could be considered as suitable applications of information and communication technologies (ICT's) for development of human capital. The examples of practical application of these approaches for evaluating LOs quality and reusability in eQNet project are also presented in the paper. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Social tagging has revolutionized the social and personal experience of users across numerous web platforms by enabling the organizing, managing, sharing and searching of web data. The extensive amount of information generated by tagging systems can be utilized for recommendation purposes. However, the unregulated creation of social tags by users can produce a great deal of noise and the tags can be unreliable; thus, exploiting them for recommendation is a nontrivial task. In this study, a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach applied is to generate user and item profiles by discovering tag patterns that are frequently generated by users. These tag patterns are categorized into irrelevant patterns and relevant patterns which represent diverse user preferences in terms of likes and dislikes. Furthermore, presented here is a method for translating these tag-based profiles into semantic profiles by determining the underlying meaning(s) of the tags, and mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases. To alleviate the cold start and overspecialization problems, semantic profiles are enriched in two phases: (a) using a semantic spreading mechanism and then (b) inheriting the preferences of similar users. Experiment indicates that this approach not only provides a better representation of user interests, but also achieves a better recommendation result when compared with existing methods. The performance of the proposed recommendation method is investigated in the face of the cold start problem, the results of which confirm that it can indeed remedy the problem for early adopters, hence improving overall recommendation quality. © The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract={This paper focuses on an emerging research topic about mining microbloggers' personalized interest tags from their own microblogs ever posted. It based on an intuition that microblogs indicate the daily interests and concerns of microblogs. Previous studies regarded the microblogs posted by one microblogger as a whole document and adopted traditional keyword extraction approaches to select high weighting nouns without considering the characteristics of microblogs. Given the less textual information of microblogs and the implicit interest expression of microbloggers, we suggest a new research framework on mining microbloggers' interests via exploiting the Wikipedia, a huge online word knowledge encyclopedia, to take up those challenges. Based on the semantic graph constructed via the Wikipedia, the proposed semantic spreading model (SSM) can discover and leverage the semantically related interest tags which do not occur in one's microblogs. According to SSM, An interest mining system have implemented and deployed on the biggest microblogging platform (Sina Weibo) in China. We have also specified a suite of new evaluation metrics to make up the shortage of evaluation functions in this research topic. Experiments conducted on a real-time dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods to identify microbloggers' interests. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It brings two key insights: first, based on evidence that existing tags for YouTube videos can be improved by an automated tag recommender, even for a sample of well curated movies, it explores the impact of using information mined from repositories created by different production modes (e.g., peer- and expert-produced); second, this study performs a preliminary characterization of the factors that impact the quality of the tag recommendation pipeline for different input data sources. © 2014 ACM.},

An ontology enabled annotation and knowledge management environment was developed and endowed with collaborative information searching agents. Two agents were implemented in order to search and download aggregated metadata and text documents from the Web and to store information into a documents corpus repository. The corpus repository is further accessed by users through the annotator interface. This original approach is based on open standards and integrates open source services that improve discovery and reasoning across domain specific collections. CREST allows users to create, edit, store, and retrieve objects and annotations, promotes development and re-use of meaningful content.

abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most successful technology for recommender systems. The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of identifying local experts in social media systems like Twitter. Local experts - in contrast to general topic experts - have specialized knowledge focused around a particular location, and are important for many applications including answering local information needs and interacting with community experts. And yet identifying these experts is difficult. Hence in this paper, we propose a geo-spatial-driven approach for identifying local experts that leverages the fine-grained GPS coordinates of millions of Twitter users. We propose a local expertise framework that integrates both users' topical expertise and their local authority. Concretely, we estimate a user's local authority via a novel spatial proximity expertise approach that leverages over 15 million geotagged Twitter lists. We estimate a user's topical expertise based on expertise propagation over 600 million geo-tagged social connections on Twitter. We evaluate the proposed approach across 56 queries coupled with over 11,000 individual judgments from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find significant improvement over both general (non-local) expert approaches and comparable local expert finding approaches. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

In our experiment, first we compare our model to baseline algorithms with several benchmark datasets. Then the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using datasets from CiteULike. The clustering results are compared against the subject categories from Web of Science for the CiteULike dataset. Experiments of clustering on both benchmark data sets and CiteULike datasets outperforms many state of the art clustering methods. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Recently collaborative tagging, also known as "folksonomy" in Web 2.0, allows users to collaboratively create and manage tags to classify and categorize dynamic content for searching and sharing. A user's interest in social resources usually changes with time in such a dynamic and information rich environment. Additionally, a social network is one innovative characteristic in social resource sharing websites. The information from a social network provides an inference of a certain user's interests based on the interests of this user's network neighbors. To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user's social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the "social friends" network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system's performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user's preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the rapid increasing rate of the high volume of social web contents due to the growing popularity of social media services, significant attention has been drawn towards recommender systems i.e. systems, that offer recommendations to users on items appropriate to their requirements. To offer suitable recommendations, the systems need comprehensive user and item models that would be able to provide thorough understanding of their characteristics and preferences. In this article, a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns, and to enrich each individual profile by a two-phase profile enrichment procedure. The profiles are extended by association rules discovered through the association rule mining process. The user/item profiles are further enriched through collaboration with other similar user/item profiles. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental result s demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

Some images are annotated with similar tags, while others are annotated with dissimilar ones. In this study, a concept called “tag-diversity,” which represents how diverse tags are annotated to an image, is proposed, and two methods to estimate it are proposed. We conducted the experiment to investigate how the two proposed methods accurately compute tag-diversity. The results of the experiment show that both methods outperformed the baseline method, which calculates tag-diversity on the basis of the number of annotated tags. We also show some images with low and high tag-diversity, and discuss how tag-diversity can improve the current image search. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Cross-domain recommender systems aim to generate or enhance personalized recommendations in a target domain by exploiting knowledge (mainly user preferences) from other source domains. Due to the heterogeneity of item characteristics across domains, content-based recommendation methods are difficult to apply, and collaborative filtering has become the most popular approach to cross-domain recommendation. Nonetheless, recent work has shown that the accuracy of cross-domain collaborative filtering based on matrix factorization can be improved by means of content information; in particular, social tags shared between domains. In this paper, we review state of the art approaches in this direction, and present an alternative recommendation model based on a novel extension of the SVD++ algorithm. Our approach introduces a new set of latent variables, and enriches both user and item profiles with independent sets of tag factors, better capturing the effects of tags on ratings. Evaluating the proposed model in the movies and books domains, we show that it can generate more accurate recommendations than existing approaches, even in cold-start situations.

abstract={Personalized recommender systems are confronting great challenges of accuracy, diversification and novelty, especially when the data set is sparse and lacks of accessorial information, such as user profiles, item attributes and explicit ratings. Collaborative tags contain abundant information about personalized preferences and item contents, and are therefore potential to help providing better recommendations. In this paper, we analyze the information on the famous music social network, Last. fm. Bipartite graph is established between users, items and tags while random walk with restart is used to analyze the relationship between the nodes discussed before and get the neighboring relations between songs or tags. After that, musicrecommended list and indirect related music collection, thus, can be obtained. At last, personalized music recommendation algorithm can be implemented by fusing and reranking the recommended list using the algorithm proposed in this paper. Experiments show that, in the same corpus, the music recommendation algorithmin this paper performs better than the ordinary method such as collaborative filtering and bipartite based algorithm. Our method built on Last. fm, therefore, satisfies the personalized requirement for users to music. Furthermore, with the development of Web2.0, our method will show its advantage as the amount of tags become more and more enormous.},

abstract={In recent years, cultural heritage institutions have increasingly used social tagging. To better understand the nature of these tags, we analyzed tags assigned to a collection of 100 images of art (provided by the steve.museum project) using subject matter categorization. Our results show that the majority of tags describe the people and objects in the image and are generic in nature. This contradicts prior subject matter analyses of queries, tags, and index terms of other image collections, suggesting that the nature of social tags largely depends on the type of collection and on user needs. This insight may help cultural heritage institutions improve their management and use of tags. © 2013 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Social tagging enables users of social media sharing platforms to annotate multimedia items by employing arbitrary keywords (i.e., tags), which describe better the multimedia content. Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a 'query and ranking' manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.},

To cope with this problem, we combine the concept of prior knowledge with social tagging methods to assist the reading comprehension of students studying English. We incorporate tags into a tag based learning approach, which then identifies suitable supplementary materials for quickly constructing a student's prior knowledge reservoir. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach benefits the students by embedding the additional information in social knowledge, and hence significantly improve their on-line reading efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Genre classification is especially interesting in the domain of narrative content which is characterized by a large number of ambiguous and overlapping categories. The rise in popularity of social tagging systems forms a rich source of input information which could be harnessed for this task. In this paper we investigate two different information folksonomy sources for the movie domain namely: keywords and tags, the first of which is user annotated and expert monitored whereas the latter is non-monitored. A comparison is performed to assess the efficacy of both sources in solving this multi-label classification problem and it is found that the in spite of being expert monitored and better structured, keywords are worse predictors of the genres of movies than tags in most cases. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates functionalities of different indexing systems based on problems in verbal subject access in library catalogues, challenging aspects of subject headings systems and social tagging, which is perceived as a method that complements controlled vocabularies. The aim of the conducted study was not only to provide a detailed insight into advantages and disadvantages of user tags and subject headings, but also to emphasize the need for evaluating user tags as a special kind of indexing system, instead of assessing them from the perspective of controlled languages. Thus, the authors argue for measuring subject headings and user tags as approaches that belong to different information landscapes that may have a similar, but not an identical purpose. User tags should therefore be surveyed and evaluated differently in order to understand and use those features that are perceived as effective in library catalogues. The results of the study are indicative for conceptualizing enhancement strategies in subject access and for adjusting library catalogues to the needs of contemporary users, or for future research in subject headings or user tagging. © VBH 2014.},

abstract={This article discusses the information representation process based on the Moscovici's Social Representation Theory and domain analysis in Information Science. The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the dataset, showed that the users' reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants - in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user's choice of resources, and sharing styles. Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a "gain scale" of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.},

abstract={Online socio-technical systems can be studied as proxy of the real world to investigate human behavior and social interactions at scale. Here we focus on Instagram, a media-sharing online platform whose popularity has been rising up to gathering hundred millions users. Instagram exhibits a mixture of features including social structure, social tagging and media sharing. The network of social interactions among users models various dynamics including follower/followee relations and users' communication by means of posts/comments. Users can upload and tag media such as photos and pictures, and they can "like" and comment each piece of information on the platform. In this work we investigate three major aspects on our Instagram dataset: (i) the structural characteristics of its network of heterogeneous interactions, to unveil the emergence of self organization and topically-induced community structure; (ii) the dynamics of content production and consumption, to understand how global trends and popular users emerge; (iii) the behavior of users labeling media with tags, to determine how they devote their attention and to explore the variety of their topical interests. Our analysis provides clues to understand human behavior dynamics on socio-technical systems, specifically users and content popularity, the mechanisms of users' interactions in online environments and how collective trends emerge from individuals' topical interests. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging becomes increasingly important to organize and search large-scale community-contributed photos on social websites. To facilitate generating high-quality social tags, tag recommendation by automatically assigning relevant tags to photos draws particular research interest. In this paper, we focus on the personalized tag recommendation task and try to identify user-preferred, geo-location-specific as well as semantically relevant tags for a photo by leveraging rich contexts of the freely available community- contributed photos. For users and geo-locations, we assume they have different preferred tags assigned to a photo, and propose a subspace learning method to individually uncover the both types of preferences. The goal of our work is to learn a unified subspace shared by the visual and textual domains to make visual features and textual information of photos comparable. Considering the visual feature is a lower level representation on semantics than the textual information, we adopt a progressive learning strategy by additionally introducing an intermediate subspace for the visual domain, and expect it to have consistent local structure with the textual space. Accordingly, the unified subspace is mapped from the intermediate subspace and the textual space respectively. We formulate the above learning problems into a united form, and present an iterative optimization with its convergence proof. Given an untagged photo with its geo-location to a user, the user-preferred and the geo-location-specific tags are found by the nearest neighbor search in the corresponding unified spaces. Then we combine the obtained tags and the visual appearance of the photo to discover the semantically and visually related photos, among which the most frequent tags are used as the recommended tags. Experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Flickr verify the effectivity of the proposed solution. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Clustering algorithms are usually based on the Bag-of-Words (BOW) approach. A tarnished hindrance of the BOW prototypical is that it ignores the semantic relationship among words. As a result, if two documents use different collections of core words to represent the same topic, they may be assigned to different clusters even though the core words they use are probably synonyms or semantically associated in other form and other disadvantage of conventional web page clustering technique is often utilized to reveal the functional similarity of WebPages. Tagging can be beneficial to improve the clustering performance. Several efforts have been made to explore social tagging for clustering. But there is some drawbacks of tagging web based clustering. All the existing approaches exploiting tag information for web page clustering assume that all the WebPages are tagged which is a somewhat restrictive assumption. In a more realistic setting, one can only expect that the tags will be available for only a small number of WebPages. Researchers propose a new web page grouping approach based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) Model. An iterative set of rules based on maximum likelihood principle is employed to overcome the aforementioned computational shortcoming. © 2013, Medwell Journals.},

abstract={We consider in this paper top-k query answering in social applications, with a focus on social tagging. This problem requires a significant departure from socially agnostic techniques. In a network-aware context, one can (and should) exploit the social links, which can indicate how users relate to the seeker and how much weight their tagging actions should have in the result build-up. We propose algorithms that have the potential to scale to current applications. While the problem has already been considered in previous literature, this was done either under strong simplifying assumptions or under choices that cannot scale to even moderate-size real-world applications. We first revisit a key aspect of the problem, which is accessing the closest or most relevant users for a given seeker. We describe how this can be done on the fly (without any pre-computations) for several possible choices - arguably the most natural ones - of proximity computation in a user network. Based on this, our top-k algorithm is sound and complete, addressing the applicability issues of the existing ones. Moreover, it performs significantly better in general and is instance optimal in the case when the search relies exclusively on the social weight of tagging actions. To further address the efficiency needs of online applications, for which the exact search, albeit optimal, may still be expensive, we then consider approximate algorithms. Specifically, these rely on concise statistics about the social network or on approximate shortest-paths computations. Extensive experiments on real-world data from Twitter show that our techniques can drastically improve response time, without sacrificing precision. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={We have been witnessing an increasing number of social tagging systems on the web. Tags help users understand a resource readily and accurately. In a social tagging system, however, there are typically a fairly large number of resources each associated with a long list of tags. When browsing resources, users are reluctant to read these tags one by one. Instead, users prefer a shorter list of tags as a compact description of a resource. Such a tag description facilitates users to understand the resource accurately and effortlessly. This calls for a generator for a tag description, which selects a set of high-quality tags for a given resource. The tag description condenses the original tag list by retaining the most important tags of the long list. We propose that a good generator should go beyond pure tag popularity and towards diversifying a tag description. In this paper, we present a general framework of selecting a set of k tags as the description for a given resource. In addition, a generative model BTM is proposed to model users' tagging process. The experimental results on real-world tagging data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in social tagging systems, showing significant improvement over the other baselines.

abstract={When interacting with social tagging systems, humans exercise complex processes of categorization that have been the topic of much research in cognitive science. In this paper we present a recommender approach for social tags derived from ALCOVE, a model of human category learning. The basic architecture is a simple three-layers connectionist model. The input layer encodes patterns of semantic features of a user-specific resource, such as latent topics elicited through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or available external categories. The hidden layer categorizes the resource by matching the encoded pattern against already learned exemplar patterns. The latter are composed of unique feature patterns and associated tag distributions. Finally, the output layer samples tags from the associated tag distributions to verbalize the preceding categorization process. We have evaluated this approach on a real-world folksonomy gathered from Wikipedia bookmarks in Delicious. In the experiment our approach outperformed LDA, a well-established algorithm. We attribute this to the fact that our approach processes semantic information (either latent topics or external categories) across the three different layers. With this paper, we demonstrate that a theoretically guided design of algorithms not only holds potential for improving existing recommendation mechanisms, but it also allows us to derive more generalizable insights about how human information interaction on the Web is determined by both semantic and verbal processes.

abstract={Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing webpages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for webpages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50, 000 training and 10, 000 testing webpages from Del.icio.us database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately. © 2013 IEEE.},

Different algorithms were proposed and evaluated for taggers and non-taggers on Movie Lens based on direct and indirect behavior. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithms can accurately predict a user's tag preference. The user's attitude toward tag preference was also analyzed.

abstract={Social tagging has become a popular way for users to annotate, search, navigate and discover online social media, resulting in the sheer amount of metadata collectively generated by people. This paper focuses on two tagging problems-(1) recommending the most suitable tags during a user's tagging process and (2) labeling latent tags relevant to a social media item-so that social media can be more browsable, searchable, and shareable by users. The proposed approach employs the Katz measure, a path-ensemble based proximity measure, to predict links in a weighted tripartite graph which represents folksonomy. From a graph-based proximity perspective, our method recommends appropriate tags for a given user-item pair, as well as uncovers hidden tags potentially relevant to a given item. We evaluate our method on real-world folksonomy collected from Last.fm. From our experiments, we show that not only does our algorithm outperform existing algorithms, but it can also obtain significant gains in cold start situations where relatively little information is known about a user or an item. © Springer-Verlag 2013.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular way to organize content. But sometimes it is also used as a way to express opinions, which is normally done through rating-or text review systems. This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The increasing availability of socially shared media with tags annotated makes it vital for retrieval approaches to precisely detect web content topic semantic and better understand user interest. Most existing methodologies process the queries merely considering user posted keywords and retrieve media labeled with tags that are similar to query words, while ignoring users implicit interests and preferences. This fact stimulates us to develop preference discovering models to reveal the users' latent intents. In this paper, we study the problem of finding user preference and interest from folksonomy corpus and propose a preference-topic model that exploits probabilistic graphical model and Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the user interested latent semantic topics. The experimental results show that, with the help of the proposed model, preference topics of the web content creators can be effectively discovered. In addition, two exemplified applications are discussed briefly. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the development and application of social media, more and more user-generated contents are created. Tag data, a kind of typical user generated content, has attracted lots of interests of researchers. In general, tags are the freely chosen textual descriptions by users to label digital data sources in social tagging systems. Poor retrieval performance remains a major problem of most social tagging systems resulting from the severe difficulty of ambiguity, redundancy, and less semantic nature of tags. Clustering method is a useful tool to increase the ability of information retrieval in the aforementioned systems. In this chapter, the authors (1) review the background of state-of-the-art tagging clustering and the tag data description, (2) present five kinds of tag similarity measurements proposed by researchers, and (3) finally propose a new clustering algorithm for tags based on local information that is derived from Kernel function. This chapter aims to benefit both academic and industry communities who are interested in the techniques and applications of tagging clustering. © 2013, IGI Global.},

On the other hand, folksonomies provide great opportunities to bootstrap the construction of thesauri. We propose an approach to semantic enrichment of folksonomies that integrates both automatic processing and user input, while formally supporting multiple points of view. We take into account the social structure of our target communities to integrate the folksonomy enrichment process into everyday tasks. Our system allows individual users to navigate more efficiently within folksonomies, and also to maintain their own structure of tags while benefiting from others contributions. Our approach brings also solutions to the bottleneck problem of knowledge acquisition by helping communities to build thesauri by integrating the manifold contributions of all their members, thus providing for a truly socio-semantic solution to folksonomy enrichment and thesauri construction. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

Recent research has focused on finding relations among tags to improve visualization and access to Web documents from tag clouds. Reorganizing tag clouds according to tag relatedness has been suggested as an effective solution to ease navigation. Most of the approaches either rely on co-occurrences or rely on textual content to represent tags. In this chapter, the authors explore tag cloud reorganization based on both of them. They compare these clouds from a qualitative point of view, analyzing pros and cons of each approach. The authors show encouraging results suggesting that co-occurrences produce more compelling reorganization of tag clouds than textual content, being computationally less expensive. © 2013, IGI Global.},

Songrium focuses on open collaboration for music content creation on the most popular Japanese video-sharing ser- vice. Since this open collaboration generates more than half a million video clips with a rich variety of music content, we call it massive open collaboration. To develop a shared understanding of this collaboration we have analyzed, we de- veloped Songrium that visualizes relations among both origi- nal songs and derivative works generated from the collabora- Tion. Songrium also features a social annotation framework to verbalize and share various relations among songs, and a exible ranking mechanism to nd interesting songs. Af- Ter we launched Songrium in August 2012, more than 7,000 users have used our service in which over 98,000 songs and 520,000 derivative works have automatically been registered. We hope Songrium will not only encourage creators to cre- Ate more derivative works, but also attract consumers to participate in the collaboration as creators.

abstract={Context aware recommender systems go beyond the traditional personalized recommendation models by incorporating a form of situational awareness. They provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a given situation or context. We consider the setting in which contextual infor-mation is represented as a subset of an item feature space describing short-term interests or needs of a user in a given situation. This contextual information can be provided by the user in the form of an explicit query, or derived implicitly. We propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates user profiles, item representations, and contextual information. The resulting recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user profile and the additional context. These probabilities are used as recommendation scores for ranking items. Our model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that provides the capability for joint modeling of users, items, and the meta-data associated with contexts. Each user profile is modeled as a mixture of the latent topics. The discovered latent topics enable our system to handle missing data in item features. We demonstrate the application of our framework for article and music recommendation. In the latter case, the set of popular tags from social tagging Web sites are used for context descriptions. Our evaluation results show that considering context can help improve the quality of recommendations. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={This paper explores the influences of creating social tags for academic papers by novice users over time. This study distinguishes itself from related studies by examining users' perspectives through three factors - document, social and personal factors. In the study, which was conducted in two time periods, diaries and interviews were employed to elicit the subjects' influences of tags choices. During the two time periods, subjects were asked to collect and tag academic papers. They were requested to fill in their diaries after assigning tags to the papers. Subjects were also interviewed to gain more insights. The outcome from both diaries and interviews were then triangulated, where the themes related to the factors emerged. Themes that emerged include documents usage, document attributes, social ties, opinion expression and organizing strategies. Results showed that the tags assigned by the subjects were influenced by all the factors. The influence from documents usage, document attributes and organizing strategies tended to play a more dominant role than social ties and opinion expression. Also, there did not seem to be any change in the levels of influence between the two time periods. Implications of our findings are discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks have become a popular medium for people to communicate and distribute ideas, content, news, and advertisements. Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

abstract={From a cognitive perspective, knowledge resides in people's minds., and there is no conceptualization of 'collective knowledge'. In the socio-cultural approach the concept of collective knowledge is central. The Co-Evolution Model of Individual Learning and Collaborative Knowledge Building (Cress & Kimmerle, 2008; Moskaliuk, Kimmerle & Cress, 2009, 2012) combines both approaches and considers internal-individual and external-collaborative processes that take place when people work on a shared artifact. We apply this framework to social tagging and explain how tag clouds represent collective knowledge. Referring to the Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli, 2007; Pirolli & Card, 1999) we show how people make use of collective knowledge when navigating with tag clouds. We give an overview of several experimental studies that induce situations where individual and collective knowledge contradict each other. The results show that in such situations incidental learning takes place, and users' individual conceptual knowledge assimilates to the collective conceptual knowledge. © ISLS.},

abstract={How to profile users and items is a key problem for recommendation in tagging systems. In contrast to tag vector based methods which ignore the semantic relations between tags, we present a novel profiling method based on a weighted tag network model to fully exploit the rich tag relations. Furthermore, by considering the extent of other users' usage of tags, we present a novel NTF-IUF-IIF method to calculate weights for tags, which can seize the user's preference accurately. Instead of a single document of traditional methods, it is the first effort to regard each user as a document collection, which enables the statistics of all items. Then the extent of other users' usage of tags can be counted via the global item information, and then used as a factor for accurate tag weighting. Finally, a Fusion Method (FM) is proposed for measuring similarities between tag networks of users and items to get the recommendation lists. Experimental results on MovieLens and CiteULike datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods. © 2013 Binary Information Press.},

abstract={In recent years, blogs were used between friends and family members. Nowadays, more and more bloggers are willing to share information with others. Therefore, it is desirable that related blogs can be connected. Clustering is often used for establishing connections between blogs. Full-text keywords retrieval process (FKRP) is generally used to obtain the keywords of posts, and the keywords were then used to cluster posts. Another approach is to use tags or categories chosen by bloggers for their posts. However, the overhead of FKRP is relatively high and the use of tagging is associated with synonymy related issues. More recently, there is an emerging concept called social tagging, which is about having web resources tagged by the general public together. Similar to this concept, we developed a blog connect platform that collects queried keywords used by the people for searching for a post. With the queried keywords, formal concept analysis (FCA) associated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is used to cluster posts. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is better than those of other studies. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging, as a novel approach to information organization and discovery, has been widely adopted in many Web 2.0 applications. Tags contributed by users to annotate a variety of Web resources or items provide a new type of information that can be exploited by recommender systems. Nevertheless, the sparsity of the ternary interaction data among users, items, and tags limits the performance of tag-based recommendation algorithms. In this article, we propose to deal with the sparsity problem in social tagging by applying random walks on ternary interaction graphs to explore transitive associations between users and items. The transitive associations in this article refer to the path of the link between any two nodes whose length is greater than one. Taking advantage of these transitive associations can allow more accurate measurement of the relevance between two entities (e.g., user-item, user-user, and item-item). A PageRank-like algorithm has been developed to explore these transitive associations by spreading users' preferences on an item similarity graph and spreading items' influences on a user similarity graph. Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that our approach can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of item recommendation. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The number of research studies on social tagging has increased rapidly in the past years, but few of them highlight the characteristics and research trends in social tagging. A set of 862 academic documents relating to social tagging and published from 2005 to 2011 was thus examined using bibliometric analysis as well as the social network analysis technique. The results show that social tagging, as a research area, develops rapidly and attracts an increasing number of new entrants. There are no key authors, publication sources, or research groups that dominate the research domain of social tagging. Research on social tagging appears to focus mainly on the following three aspects: (a) components and functions of social tagging (e.g., tags, tagging objects, and tagging network), (b) taggers' behaviors and interface design, and (c) tags' organization and usage in social tagging. The trend suggest that more researchers turn to the latter two integrated with human computer interface and information retrieval, although the first aspect is the fundamental one in social tagging. Also, more studies relating to social tagging pay attention to multimedia tagging objects and not only text tagging. Previous research on social tagging was limited to a few subject domains such as information science and computer science. As an interdisciplinary research area, social tagging is anticipated to attract more researchers from different disciplines. More practical applications, especially in high-tech companies, is an encouraging research trend in social tagging. © 2013 ASIS&T.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of web 2.0 technologies, tagging become much more important today to facilitate personal organization and also provide a possibility for users to search information or discover new things with Collaborative Tagging Systems. However, the simplistic and user-centered design of this kind of systems cause the task of finding personally interesting users is becoming quite out of reach for the common user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation. This is because CF always been attack by malicious users that will make it suffers in finding the truly interesting users. With this problem in mind, this study proposes a hybrid User Trust method to enhance CF in order to increase accuracy of user recommendation in social tagging system. This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. In addition, it indicated that the hybrid method give more accurate recommendation than the existing CF based on user trust. © 2013 Science Publications.},

abstract={In recent years Social Tagging (ST) has become a popular functionality in social learning environments, not least because tags support the exchange of users' knowledge representations, a process called social sensemaking. An important design feature of ST-Systems (STS) is the tag recommendation service. Several principles for tag recommendation mechanisms (TRM) have been proposed, which are built upon a technical and statistical perspective on STS and based on aggregated user data on a word level. Up to now, a cognitive perspective also taking into account memory processes has been neglected. In this paper we therefore introduce a TRM that applies a formal theory of human memory to model a user's prototypical tag configurations. The algorithm underlying the TRM is supposed to recommend psychologically plausible tag combinations and to mediate social sensemaking. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={A social tagging system, such as del.icio.us and Flickr, allows users to annotate resources (e.g., web pages and photos) with text descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable information for searching, mining, and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result, while some highly-popular resources are over-tagged, most of the resources are under-tagged. Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-based techniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tag specific resources, how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcing environment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this question by observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been tagged a sufficient number of times. We formalize the concepts of tagging quality (TQ) and tagging stability (TS) in measuring the quality of a resource's tag description. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed "budget" (i.e., the amount of money paid for tagging resources). This solution decides the amount of rewards that should be invested on each resource in order to maximize tagging stability. We further propose a few simple, practical, and efficient incentive allocation strategies. On a dataset from del.icio.us, our best strategy provides resources with a close-to-optimal gain in tagging stability. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging has been lauded for providing a voice of the user community, free of restrictions dictated by knowledge organization standards for subject access. Tagging allows many perspectives to be represented, but at what cost? Using deconstruction, Derrida argues that absolute hospitality is required to ensure justice for access and inclusiveness; however, the consequence becomes that the host becomes hostage to the other. In this ongoing research, we explore the Derridean concept of hospitality as it relates to social tagging, examining the consequences of unconditional inclusiveness, the process of discerning constraints to hospitality in order to interpret different kinds of "othermsf-or what Derrida calls the "impossible" decision-and what mitigation means, using the social tagging environment to illustrate.},

The main idea behind tagging is to allow users to provide metadata to the web content from their perspective to facilitate categorization and retrieval. There are many factors that influence users' tag choice. Many studies have been conducted to reveal these factors by analysing tagging data. This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging. © 2012 IEEE.},

The results revealed that most frequent tag creators use the tags very often. However, there are users who use others' tags frequently without bothering creating tags by their own. The results also indicate that search is the primary motivation of creating tags as well as using tags.

abstract={In our daily lives, organizing resources like books or webpages into a set of categories to ease future access is a common task. The usual largeness of these collections requires a vast endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually. As an approach to effectively produce an automated classification of resources, we consider the immense amounts of annotations provided by users on social tagging systems in the form of bookmarks. In this paper, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags to perform a social classification of resources. For this purpose, we have created three large-scale social tagging data sets including tagging data for different types of resources, webpages and books. Those resources are accompanied by categorization data from sound expert-driven taxonomies. We analyze the characteristics of the three social tagging systems and perform an analysis on the usefulness of social tags to perform a social classification of resources that resembles the classification by experts as much as possible. We analyze six different representations using tags and compare to other data sources by using three different settings of SVM classifiers. Finally, we explore combinations of different data sources with tags using classifier committees to best classify the resources. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The boom of Flickr, a photo-sharing social tagging system, leads to a dramatical increasing of online social interactions. For example, it offers millions of groups for users to join in order to share photos and keep relations. However, the rapidly increasing amount of groups hampers users' participation, thus it is necessary to suggest groups according to users' preferences. By analyzing user-generated tags, one can explore users' potential interests, and discover the latent topics of the corresponding groups. Furthermore, users' behaviors are affected by their friends. Based on these intuitions, we propose a topic-based group recommendation model to predict users' potential interests and conduct group recommendations based on tags and social relations. The proposed model provides a way to fuse tag information and social network structure to predict users' future interests accurately. The experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The study shows that there is a whole process of stigmatization of persons with disabilities which resulted in the victimization of these persons. The quantitative method was used for processing statistics, and the qualitative method for the analysis and the meaning of the speach. Rejection and frustration of the behaviour and of the attitude of the disabled and the treatments capitalizing in the inability to get rid of the blocking of the stigma reflect the victimization of persons with stigmatized disabilities.

abstract={Social tagging systems have become a popular system to organize information in many web 2.0 sites. They are also being rapidly adopted in enterprises to enhance information sharing, knowledge sharing and emerged as a novel categorization scheme based on the collective knowledge of people. Scalability is an issue of the categorization of the resources of social tagging systems. Scalability has highlighted a critical trade-off between accuracy and complexity. As social tagging systems evolve over time, resource categories can appear or disappear either by grouping new resources or disaggregating existing ones, and this implies the re-assignation of the resources involved to others categories. This makes the methods and/or algorithms that categorize resources of social tagging systems to be non-scalable, and then not efficiently implementable on real social tagging systems. This paper presents a simple method for categorizing resources on social tagging systems which is self-adaptive, scalable and implementable in any real social tagging system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Social tagging systems leverage social interoperability by facilitating the searching, sharing, and exchanging of tagging resources. A major drawback of existing social tagging systems is that social tags are used as keywords in keyword-based search. They focus on keywords and human interpretability rather than on computer interpretable semantic knowledge. Therefore, social tags are useful for information sharing and organizing, but they lack the computer-interpretability needed to facilitate a personalized social tag recommendation. An interesting issue is how to automatically generate a personalized social tag recommendation list to users when a resource is accessed by users. The novel solution proposed in this study is a hybrid approach based on semantic tag-based resource profile and user preference to provide personalized social tag recommendation. Experiments show that the Precision and Recall of the proposed hybrid approach effectively improves the accuracy of social tag recommendation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many images uploaded to social networks are related to travel, since people consider traveling to be an important event in their life. However, a significant amount of travel images on the Internet lack proper geographical annotations or tags. In many cases, the images are tagged manually. One way to make this time-consuming manual tagging process more efficient is to propagate tags from a small set of tagged images to the larger set of untagged images automatically. In this paper, we present a system for automatic geotag propagation in images based on the similarity between image content (famous landmarks) and its context (associated geotags). In such a scenario, however, an incorrect or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated propagation system. Therefore, for reliable geotags propagation, we suggest adopting a user trust model based on social feedback from the users of the photo-sharing system. We compare this socially-driven approach with other user trust models via experiments and subjective testing on an image database of various famous landmarks. Results demonstrate that relying on user feedback is more efficient, since the number of propagated tags more than doubles without loss of accuracy compared to using other models or propagating without trust modeling. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Web-based self-learning (WBSL) has received a lot of attention in recent years due to the vast amount of varied materials available in the Web 2.0 environment. However, this large amount of material also has resulted in a serious problem of cognitive overload that degrades the efficacy of learning. In this study, an information graphics method is proposed to resolve this problem. This method is based on social tagging, which is used to visualize the relationships among materials and can thus assist learners in facilitating learning. To examine the feasibility of the proposed method for managing cognitive load, an experimental model was designed in which cognitive load theory was adopted as the theoretical framework. A total of 60 university students participated in the experiment, and the partial least squares method was used to verify the experimental model. The results show that the information graphics method has a positive impact on three types of cognitive load, namely intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Furthermore, intrinsic and germane cognitive load have a positive influence on perceived learning effectiveness, while extraneous cognitive load does not have a significant influence. One possible reason for this outcome is that the problem of visual load was not considered in the design of this study. The overall summary of the findings is that the use of social tagging can effectively manage cognitive load and positively links to perceived learning effectiveness. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In the midst of the "digital revolution," should we be pleased or disappointed about its effects in the field of art history? How does one answer this question, which is most likely premature and lacking in analytical acuity given what we know about art historical preferences and practices? But even if we accept the digital revolution as a broad concept to mean simply that image researchers have an unprecedented flood of reproductions at their fingertips, there is no question that we can still detect real feelings of unease about what this flood has brought us so far. This article takes a simple visual motif-one person carrying another-as a starting point for an iconographic exploration. In demonstrating and imagining how source material could be collected, arranged, and rearranged, it recalls in a general way the panels with photographs that Aby Warburg (1866-1929) set up to help him develop ideas and relationships in the process of his art historical research. If we could design easily accessible corpora of sources so that continuous rearrangement by visual motif and meaning were easy, and if we could seduce researchers and catalogers to cooperate in enriching them with more and better descriptions, tags, and links, the study of iconography could make a significant leap forward. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={When the Walker Art Center, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, publishes its next collection catalog online (http://collections.walkerart.org/) this year, entries on works in the collection will be extensive, dynamic, and free to anyone with an Internet connection. With high-resolution images and rich media, in-depth texts, perpetually updated information, various critical perspectives, and augmented search capabilities, the publication is expansive, alterable, and ongoing-always in production, in pace with discourses on art of our time. This new kind of catalog becomes a platform for presenting and exchanging research on works of contemporary art in a setting that allows for long-term thinking. It gives space, time, and opportunities to engage with complex concepts and processes behind works in the Walker's collection. This article briefly describes the composition of content for an online catalog entry, while discussing the evolution of contemporary arts scholarship in the era of digital humanities publishing. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of social tagging systems, the potential for using social tags as a source of metadata is being explored. Social tagging systems can simplify the involvement of a large number of users and improve the metadata-generation process. Current research is exploring social tagging systems as a mechanism to allow nonprofessional catalogers to participate in metadata generation. Because social tags are not from controlled vocabularies, there are issues that have to be addressed in finding quality terms to represent the content of a resource. This research explores ways to obtain a set of tags representing the resource from the tags provided by users. Two metrics are introduced. Annotation Dominance (AD) is a measure of the extent to which a tag term is agreed to by users. Cross Resources Annotation Discrimination (CRAD) is a measure of a tag's potential to classify a collection. It is designed to remove tags that are used too broadly or narrowly. Using the proposed measurements, the research selects important tags (meta-terms) and removes meaningless ones (tag noise) from the tags provided by users. To evaluate the proposed approach to find classificatory metadata candidates, we rely on expert users' relevance judgments comparing suggested tag terms and expert metadata terms. The results suggest that processing of user tags using the two measurements successfully identifies the terms that represent the topic categories of web resource content. The suggested tag terms can be further examined in various usages as semantic metadata for the resources. © 2013 ASIS&T.},

abstract={We propose a user model to support personalized learning paths through online material. Our approach is a variant of student modeling using the computer tutoring concept of knowledge tracing. Knowledge tracing involves representing the knowledge required to master a domain, and, from traces of online user behavior, diagnosing user knowledge states as a profile over those elements. The user model is induced from documents tagged by an expert in a social tagging system. Tags identified with "expertise" in a domain can be used to identify a corpus of domain documents. That corpus can be fed to an automated process that distills a topic model representation characteristic of the domain. As a learner navigates and reads online material, inferences can be made about the degree to which topics in the target domain have been learned. We validate this knowledge tracing approach against data from a social tagging study. As part of this evaluation, we match the predictions of the knowledge-tracing model to individual participant responses made to individual question items used to test domain knowledge. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The proposed approach adapts the Katz measure, a path-ensemble based proximity measure, for the use in social tagging systems. We model a folksonomy as a weighted, undirected tripartite graph. We then apply the Katz measure to this graph, and exploit it to provide tag recommendations for individual users. We evaluate our method on two real-world folksonomies collected from CiteULike and Last.fm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance and is effective for both active taggers and cold-start taggers compared to existing algorithms. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The literature often views the emergence of social tagging as a potential alternative method to controlled vocabulary for organizing and indexing large-scale information resources. In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of the relationship between social tagging and controlled vocabulary-based indexing and organization in two unique contexts: the information science domain and when comparing data gathered from both English and Chinese sources. Our results show that the information science domain has more overlap between social tags and controlled vocabulary-based subject terms. This is reflected in the higher percentage of overlapping terms between tags and subject terms, as well as in the strong similarity (measured by Jaccard's coefficient) in frequently used keywords among tags and subject terms. However, social tags in the information science domain still possess limitations in terms of uncontrolled terms, where inconsistencies and noisy usages exist. Our results also show that language difference does have an impact on social tagging. The numbers of Chinese tags overall and per book are less than those of English tags. The most frequently used English tags are single-word terms, which are different from multi-word controlled vocabulary terms. In comparison, the character difference between the most frequently used Chinese tags and Chinese subject terms is just one character (3 vs 4). However, English and Chinese users do share many similar behaviours when they tag books in the information science domain. Many of the most frequently used tags are shared between the two languages and the patterns of overlap between topical tags and subject terms are also similar between the two languages. Overall, despite the application limitations for social tagging in cataloguing and indexing, we believe that tagging has the potential to become a complementary resource for expanding and enriching controlled vocabulary systems. With the help of future technology to regulate and promote features related to controlled vocabulary in social tags, a hybrid cataloguing and indexing system that integrates social tags with controlled vocabulary would greatly improve people's organizational and access capabilities within information resources. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={In order to adapt functionality to their individual users, systems need information about these users. The Social Web provides opportunities to gather user data from outside the system itself. Aggregated user data may be useful to address cold-start problems as well as sparse user profiles, but this depends on the nature of individual user profiles distributed on the Social Web. For example, does it make sense to re-use Flickr profiles to recommend bookmarks in Delicious? In this article, we study distributed form-based and tag-based user profiles, based on a large dataset aggregated from the Social Web. We analyze the completeness, consistency and replication of form-based profiles, which users explicitly create by filling out forms at Social Web systems such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. We also investigate tag-based profiles, which result from social tagging activities in systems such as Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon: to what extent do tag-based profiles overlap between different systems, what are the benefits of aggregating tag-based profiles. Based on these insights, we developed and evaluated the performance of several cross-system user modeling strategies in the context of recommender systems. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods solve the cold-start problem and improve recommendation quality significantly, even beyond the cold-start. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Secondly, the existing techniques about tag recommendation are summarized, and their merits and demerits are analysed. In most techniques for tag recommendation only two dimensions "resource-user" are considered. But there are three dimensions "resource-user-tag" in recommendation system based on social tags.

abstract={Many studies on folksonomy analysis have focused on discovering meaningful patterns between three main entities (i.e., users, tags, and resources) from a folksonomy system to provide various information services to users. However, most of them have simply assumed that the tags in the folksonomy are written in a same language, i.e., any tags can be compared with others. In this work, multilingual folksonomies are focused to discover useful matchings between multilingual tags (e.g., among 'Korea' in English, Coréia in Portuguese and 'Corée' in French). Moreover, such matchings can be applied to expand user queries to retrieve additional resources tagged by the other languages. We focus on analyzing a multilingual folksonomy generated by various lingual practices of online users, and discovering meaningful relationships between multilingual tags (e.g., between 'Seoul' in English and 'Corée' in French) co-occurred in the folksonomy. Thereby, we propose novel methods for (i) identifying lingual practices from user tagging patterns to build community of lingual practice and (ii) exploiting the tag matchings to extend simple term-based queries. Thus, additional resources tagged by other languages can be retrieved. To evaluate the proposed multilingual tag matching method, we have collected real tagging datasets from several well-known social tagging websites (e.g., Del.icio.us), and applied to translating queries to other languages without any external dictionaries. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Functionality is defined as the extent to which the system minimizes both encoding and decoding efforts, following Zipf's principle of least effort. The Yule-Simon model is adopted as the growth mechanism of the system. Two hypotheses are proposed: The first predicts decline, increase, and stabilization of the tag-frequency distribution; the second predicts an oscillation in the functionality leading to a dampened stability.

abstract={To help users organize and retrieve the image resources efficiently, most image sharing sites allow users to annotate the images with tags. Image tag recommendation systems aim to provide a set of tag candidates to facilitate the tagging process done by users. Previous image tag recommendation methods are usually developed based on tag co-occurrence information. However, due to the neglect of the visual information associated with images and the semantic diversity among recommended tags, the recommendation results of previous methods often suffer from the problems of tag ambiguity and redundancy. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel image tag recommendation approach, which considers both the relevance and diversity of the recommended tags. First, the approach employs the visual language model to calculate the relevance between a tag and an image, as well as the visual distance between two tags. Then, according to the above calculations, a greedy search algorithm is proposed to find a tag set as the final recommendation, which reaches a reasonable trade-off between the relevance and diversity. Experiments on Flickr data set show the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, topic coverage and F1 value.},

abstract={The increasing amount of online music content has opened opportunities for implementing new effective information access services—commonly known as music recommender systems—that support music navigation, discovery, sharing, and formation of user communities. In recent years, a new research area of contextual music recommendation and retrieval has emerged. Context-aware music recommender systems are capable of suggesting music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user’s mood or location, that may influence the user’s preferences at a particular moment. In this work, we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation task—selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags assigned to both music tracks and POIs, and we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. Following an initial web-based evaluation of the core matching technique, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI, and evaluated it in a live user study. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music as suited for the POIs, and that the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario. © 2012, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={The naming game (NG) describes the agreement dynamics of a population of N agents interacting locally in pairs leading to the emergence of a shared vocabulary. This model has its relevance in the novel fields of semiotic dynamics and specifically to opinion formation and language evolution. The application of this model ranges from wireless sensor networks as spreading algorithms, leader election algorithms to user-based social tagging systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of overhearing (i.e., at every time step of the game, a random set of Nδ individuals are chosen from the population who overhear the transmitted word from the speaker and accordingly reshape their inventories). When δ = 0 one recovers the behavior of the original NG. As one increases δ, the population of agents reaches a faster agreement with a significantly low-memory requirement. The convergence time to reach global consensus scales as logN as δ approaches 1. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

Social tags and resource contents are leveraged to model user interest in two similar and correlated ways. Our primary goal is to capture user tagging behavior and interest and discover the emergent topical community structure. The communities should be groups of users with frequent social interactions as well as similar topical interests, which would have important research implications for personalized information services. Experimental results on two real social tagging data sets with different genres have shown that the proposed generative model more accurately models user interest and detects high-quality and meaningful topical communities. © 2012 ASIS&;T.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel Tensor Factorization and tag Clustering (TFC) model is presented for item recommendation in social tagging systems. The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and "cold start" problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf • idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, few studies have directly discussed why social tagging can benefit from user-generated tags in reading learning. Therefore, this paper first explores the use of effective social tagging learning to help students not only improve their understanding of the English material that they read, but also develop their ability to read well. We then investigate how to apply tag-based learning to help learners focus on studying the resources and make sense of the material and remember it more easily.

abstract={Music emotion recognition (MER) aims to recognize the affective content of a piece of music, which is important for applications such as automatic soundtrack generation and music recommendation. MER is commonly formulated as a supervised learning problem. In practice, except for Pop music, there is little labeled data in most genres. In addition, emotion is genre specific in music and thus the labeled data of Pop music cannot be used for other genres. In this paper, we aim to solve the genre-specific MER problem by exploiting two kinds of auxiliary data: unlabeled songs and social tags. However, using these two kinds of data effectively is a non-trivial task, e.g. tags are noisy and therefore cannot be treated as fully trustworthy. To build an accurate model with the help from the unlabeled songs and noisy tags, we present SMART, which stands for Semi-Supervised Music Affective Emotion Recognition with Social Tagging, combining of a graph-based semisupervised learning algorithm with a novel tag refinement method. Experiments on the Million Song Dataset show that our proposed approach, trained with only 10 labeled instances, is as accurate as Support Vector Regression trained with 750 labeled songs.

abstract={Online social networks have become important for sharing, discovery, communication, and networking. Recommender systems are an essential part of any social network. For example, recommending people to connect with is essential for the growth of the network since an online social network is only partially observed and two people might know each other but may not be connected. In this paper, we analyze data from LinkedIn, the largest online professional social network, which recommends other members to connect through its "People You May Know" feature. Analyzing the effect of structural diversity on the invitation rate from such member recommendations, we find that higher connection density and lower structural diversity results in a higher connection invitation rate. We also analyze and study the effects of structural diversity of members' connection networks on their engagement on the LinkedIn network.},

Many museums and associations opened their collections for access on the web and have studied the potential of social tagging. User data collected by tagging in art social platforms are a precious information source about emotional responses to artworks and a feedback about the way in which users perceives collections. In this paper, we present our new achievements on this topic within the ArsEmotica framework. Our focus is on eliciting sharable emotional meanings from online collection visitors tags, by interactively involving the users of the virtual communities in the process of capturing the latent emotions behind the tags. We rely on methods and tools from a set of disciplines ranging from Semantic and Social Web to NLP. Such disciplines provide the building blocks for creating a semantic social space, where artworks can be dynamically organized according to a new ontology of emotions inspired by the well-known Plutchik's model of human emotions. The final aim is to involve users in the creation of such emotional space and, then, to offer them an emotion-driven access to the artworks.},

abstract={Tag clouds generated in social tagging systems can capture the collective knowledge of communities. Using as a basis spreading activation theories, information foraging theory, and the co-evolution model of cognitive and social systems, we present here a model for an extended information scent, which proposes that both collective and individual knowledge have a significant influence on link selection, incidental learning, and information processing. Two experimental studies tested the applicability of the model to a situation in which individual knowledge and collective knowledge were contradictory to each other. The results of the first experiment showed that a higher individual strength of association between a target in demand and a tag led to a higher probability of selecting corresponding links, combined with less thorough information processing for non-corresponding links. But users also adapted their navigation behavior to the collective knowledge (strength of associations of tags) of the community and showed incidental learning during navigation, which resulted in a change of their individual strength of associations. The second experiment confirmed these results and showed, in addition, that the effects also occurred for indirect associations. Altogether, the results show that the extended information scent is an appropriate and fertile model for describing the interplay of individual knowledge and the collective knowledge of social tags. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Social tagging systems allow people to classify Web resources by using a set of freely chosen terms commonly called tags. However, by shifting the classification task from a set of experts to a larger and untrained set of people, the results of the classification are not accurate. The lack of control and guidelines generates noisy tags (i.e. tags without a clear semantic) which lower the precision of the user generated classifications. In order to face this limitation several tools have been proposed in the literature for suggesting to the users tags which properly describe a given resource. On the other hand we propose to suggest n-grams (named keyphrases) by following the idea that sequences of two/three terms can better face potential ambiguities. More specifically, in this work, we identify a set of features which characterize n-grams adequate for describing meaningful aspects reported in the Web pages. By means of these features, we developed a mechanism which can support people when classifying Web pages by automatically suggesting meaningful keyphrases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to describe and organize items using labels in a free-shared vocabulary (tags), improving their browsing experience in large collections of items. At present, the most accurate collaborative filtering techniques build user profiles in latent factor spaces that are not interpretable by users. In this paper, we propose a general method to build linear-interpretable user profiles that can be used for user interaction in a recommender system, using the well-known simple additive weighting model (SAW) for multi-attribute decision making. In experiments, two kinds of user profiles where tested: one from free contributed tags and other from keywords automatically extracted from textual item descriptions. We compare them for their ability to predict ratings and their potential for user interaction. As a test bed, we used a subset of the database of the University of Minnesota's movie review system-Movielens, the social tags proposed by Vig et al. (2012) in their work "The Tag Genome", and movie synopses extracted from the Netflix's API. We found that, in "warm" scenarios, the proposed tag and keyword-based user profiles produce equal or better recommendations that those based on latent-factors obtained using matrix factorization. Particularly, the keyword-based approach obtained 5.63% of improvement. In cold-start conditions-movies without rating information, both approaches perform close to average. Moreover, a user profile visualization is proposed arising an accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff between tag and keyword-based profiles. While keyword-based profiles produce more accurate recommendations, tag-based profiles seems to be more readable, meaningful and convenient for creating profile-based user interfaces.

abstract={Affective computing is receiving increasing attention in many sectors, ranging from advertisement to politics. Its application to the Planet Art, however, is quite at its beginning, especially for what concerns the visual arts. This work, set in a Social Semantic Web framework, explores the possibility of extracting rich, emotional semantic information from the tags freely associated to digitalized visual artworks, identifying the prevalent emotions that are captured by the tags. This is done by means of ArsEmotica, an application software that we developed and that combines an ontology of emotional concepts with available computational and sentiment lexicons. Besides having made possible the enrichment of the ontology with over four-hundred Italian terms, ArsEmotica is able to analyse the emotional semantics of a tagged artwork by working at different levels: not only it can compute a semantic value, captured by tags that can be directly associated to emotional concepts, but it can also compute the semantic value of tags that can be ascribed to emotional concepts only indirectly. The results of a user study, aimed at validating the outcomes of ArsEmotica, are reported and commented. They were obtained by involving the users of the same community which tagged the artworks. It is important to observe that the tagging activity was not performed with the aim of later applying some kind of Sentiment Analysis, but in a pure Web 2.0 approach, i.e. as a form of spontaneous annotation produced by the members of the community on one another's artworks.},

abstract={Purpose - This chapter aims to discuss the issues associated with social indexing as a solution to the challenges of current information organization systems by investigating the quality and efficacy of social indexing. Design/methodology/approach - The chapter focuses on the study which compared indexing similarity between two professional groups and also compared social tagging and professional indexing. The study employed the method of the modified vector-based Indexing Consistency Density (ICD) with three different similarity measures: cosine similarity, dot product similarity, and Euclidean distance metric. Findings - The investigation of social indexing in comparison of professional indexing demonstrates that social tags are more accurate descriptions of resources and reflection of more current terminology than controlled vocabulary. Through the characteristics of social tagging discussed in this chapter, we have a clearer understanding of the extent to which social indexing can be used to replace and improve upon professional indexing. Research limitations/implications - As investment in professionally developed web directories diminishes, it becomes even more critical to understand the characteristics of social tagging and to obtain benefit from it. In future research, the examination of subjective tags needs to be conducted. A survey or user study on tagging behavior also would help to extend understanding of social indexing practices. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the Web 2.0 era, a variety of social media have begun to penetrate Chinese digital immigrants' lives, and user-generated content (UGC) is now a popular mode for creating and generating online information resources. According to China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC) reports, many digital immigrants actively participate in blogging, video sharing, online rating, social tagging, and micro blogging, etc. However, some may be more skilled in producing and generating online contents and have higher generative capabilities while others still meet some barriers in doing so. Thus, it is interesting to investigate the online generative capability of Chinese digital immigrants in Web 2.0 context. In this research-in-progress article, we present an exploratory study on online generative capability of Chinese digital immigrants in Shanghai local communities by a semistructured interview. The aim of this paper is to propose an integrated conceptual framework of online generative capability and identify the related issues about the UGC adoption and generating behaviour by the Chinese digital immigrants, who constitutes a large group of Internet users and has a significant growth tendency. The potential findings may yield some suggestions and practical implications for the designer, manager, and information service staff from different perspectives to facilitate the Chinese digital immigrant's online generative capability, and further narrow the digital divide and alleviate the information inequality in China.},

abstract={Some of the most popular sites in the Web today are the social tagging systems or folksonomies (e.g. Delicious, Flickr LastFm) where the users share resources and collaboratively annotate those resources with meaningful tags. This helps in the search and the organization of the vast amount of resources. Folksonomies are modelled as tripartite user-resource-tag hypergraphs to study their network properties. Detecting communities of similar nodes from such networks is a challenging and well-studied problem. However, most existing algorithms for community detection in folksonomies assign unique communities to nodes, whereas in reality, nodes are often associated with multiple overlapping communities. Users have multiple topical interests, and the same resource is often tagged with semantically different tags. The few attempts to detect overlapping communities work on projections of the hypergraph, which results in significant loss of the information contained in the original tripartite structure. In this chapter, we present “Overlapping Hypergraph Clustering” algorithm which detects overlapping communities in folksonomies using the complete tripartite hypergraph structure. The algorithm converts a hypergraph into its corresponding weighted line graph, using measures of hyperedge similarity. Then simple nonoverlapping communities are detected from the line graph, which in turn produce overlapping communities in the folksonomy. Through extensive experiments on synthetic as well as real folksonomy data, we demonstrate that the “Overlapping Hypergraph Clustering” algorithm can detect better community structures in folksonomies as compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

abstract={We consider the problem of personalized text-based music retrieval where users' history of preferences are taken into account in addition to their issued textual queries. Current retrieval methods mostly rely on songs meta-data. This limits the query vocabulary. Moreover, it is very costly to gather this information in large collections of music. Alternatively, we use music annotations retrieved from social tagging Websites such as last.fm and use them as textual descriptions of songs. Considering a user's profile and using preference patterns of music among all users, as in collaborative filtering approaches, can be useful in providing personalized and more satisfactory results. The main challenge is how to include both users' profiles and the songs meta-data in the retrieval model. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that takes into account the users' preference history as well as tag co-occurrences in songs. Our model is an extension of LDA where topics are formed as joint clusterings of songs and tags. These topics capture the tag associations and user preferences and correspond to different music tastes. Each user's profile is represented as a distribution over topics which shows the user's interests in different types of music. We will explain how our model can be used for contextual retrieval. Our experimental results show significant improvement in retrieval when user profiles are taken into account. Copyright © 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

abstract={Social tagging constitutes one of the defining characteristics of Web 2.0 as it allows users to collectively classify and find diverse resources, such as Web pages, songs or pictures, using open-ended tags. The data structures underlying these systems, also known as folksonomies, suffered an explosive growth on account of the widespread success of social tagging. Thus, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to find interesting resources as well as filter information streams coming from this massive amount of user-generated content on Web 2.0. In addition, most resources lacks easily extractable content to apply traditional content-based profiling approaches. In this paper we present an approach to build tag-based profiles for multimedia resources (such as songs, pictures or videos) using the social tags associated to resources as a means to describe them and, in turn, user interests. Experimental results show that the tags assigned by members of the community can help to predict the interestigness of a given resource for a user in an effective way. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, resources such as images and videos are annotated with descriptive words called tags. It has been shown that tag-based resource searching and retrieval is much more effective than content-based retrieval. With the advances in mobile technology, many resources are also geo-tagged with location information. We observe that a traditional tag (word) can carry different semantics at different locations. We study how location information can be used to help distinguish the different semantics of a resource's tags and thus to improve retrieval accuracy. Given a search query, we propose a location-partitioning method that partitions all locations into regions such that the user query carries distinguishing semantics in each region. Based on the identified regions, we utilize location information in estimating the ranking scores of resources for the given query. These ranking scores are learned using the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework. Two algorithms, namely, LTD and LPITF, which apply Tucker Decomposition and Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization, respectively for modeling the ranking score tensor are proposed. Through experiments on real datasets, we show that LTD and LPITF outperform other tag-based resource retrieval methods. © 2012 ACM.},

Tag, as the most striking characteristic of social tagging systems, plays an essential role for depicting items both explicitly and implicitly. However, the problems of the semantic ambiguity and the huge tag searching space hinder the efficient analysis towards to the tags. To solve the limitations, we utilize clustering based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to group the semantic related tags for discovering the hidden conceptual tag clusters layer between the user and item. Different from other methods based on PLSA, our method matches the hidden concepts discovered and the tag clusters corresponding to the item cluster. The method was evaluated through a case study of whether the topic related tag clusters could be found. Additionally, four indexes are provided and the comparison to the traditional method are given to evaluate the performance. Copyright © 2012 Binary Information Press.},

abstract={This paper studies web object classification problem with the novel exploration of social tags. More and more web objects are increasingly annotated with human interpretable labels (i.e., tags), which can be considered as an auxiliary attribute to assist the object classification. Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental pre-process for indexing, browsing, searching, and mining heterogeneous web objects. However, such heterogeneous web objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable and uniform descriptive features. In this paper, we propose a discriminative tag-centric model for web object classification by jointly modeling the objects category labels and their corresponding social tags and un-coding the relevance among social tags. Our approach is based on recent techniques for learning large-scale discriminative models. We conduct experiments to validate our approach using real-life data. The results show the feasibility and good performance of our approach. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging systems allow users to easily create, organize, and share collections of Web resources in a collaborative fashion. Videos, pictures, research papers, and Web pages are shared and annotated in sites such as Del.icio.us, CiteULike, or Flickr, among others. The rising popularity of these systems leads to a constant increase in the number of users actively publishing and annotating resources and, consequently, an exponential growth in the amount of data contained in their folksonomies, the underlying data structure of tagging systems. In turn, the user task of discovering interesting resources becomes more and more difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, the problem of filtering resources from social tagging systems according to individual user interests using purely tagging data is studied. One-class support vector machine classification is evaluated as a means to identify relevant information for users based exclusively on positive examples of their information preferences. It is assumed that users express their interest on resources belonging to a folksonomy by assigning tags to them, whereas there is no straightforward method to collect uninterestingness judgments. Filtering interesting resources based on social tags is an important benefit of exploiting the collective knowledge generated by tagging activities of Web communities. In this paper, the results achieved with tag-based classification are compared with those obtained using more traditional information sources such as the full text of Web pages. Experimental evaluation showed that tag-based classifiers outperformed those learned using the text of documents as well as other content-related sources. Moreover, tag-based classification becomes essential for folksonomies in which no additional content is available because of the nature of resources being stored (e.g., tagging of photos or videos).

abstract={Category systems have traditionally been created by small committees of people who had authority over the system they were designing. With the rise of large-scale social media systems, category schemes are being created by groups with differing perspectives, values, and expectations for how categories will be used. Prior studies of social tagging and folksonomy focused on the application and evolution of the collective category scheme, but struggled to uncover some of the collective rationale undergirding the decision-making processes in those schemes. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze the early discussions among editors of Wikipedia about the design and creation of its category system. We highlight three themes that dominated the discussion: hierarchy, scope and navigation, and relate these themes to their more formal roots in the information science literature. We distill out four styles of collaboration with regard to category systems that apply broadly to social tagging and other folksonomies. We conclude the paper with implications for collaborative tools and category systems as applied to large-scale collaborative systems. Copyright © 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

abstract={Social tagging systems allow people to classify resources by using a set of freely chosen terms named tags. However, by shifting the classification task from a set of experts to a larger and not trained set of people, the results of the classification are not accurate. The lack of control and guidelines generates noisy tags (i.e. tags without a clear semantics) which deteriorate the precision of the user generated classifications. In order to face this limitation several tools have been proposed in the literature for suggesting to the users tags which properly describe a given resource. In this paper we propose to suggest n-grams (named keyphrases) by following the idea that sequences of two/three terms can better face potential ambiguities. More specifically, in this work, we identify a set of features which characterize n-grams able to describe meaningful aspects reported in Web pages. By means of these features we developed a mechanism which can support people to manually classify Web pages by automatically suggesting meaningful keyphrases expressed in English.

abstract={A new collaborative approach in information organization and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI), which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric. The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree.

abstract={This paper explores the search effectiveness of social tagging which allows the public to freely tag resources, denoted as keywords, with any words as well as to share personal opinions on those resources. Social tagging potentially helps users to organize, manage, and retrieve resources. Efficient retrieval can help users put more of their focus on studying the resources rather than the retrieval process. This study was an investigation into the relations between social tags and user queries. Our findings were summarized into 4 main points: 1) 85% of the surveyed users agreed that social tags assisted them in searching for resources; 2) Over 40% of user queries searches, found their resources via the matching of social tags; 3) Social tags matched over 70% of user queries; 4) 14% of the social tags for a resource did not appear in the context of the resource. The experimental results demonstrated that social tags can improve users' efficiency in searching for resources. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

abstract={With the expansion of e-commerce, recommender systems are drawing more and more attentions. Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular algorithm used for recommendation, but it performs not very well for sparse data and new users. The emergence of trust-based recommender system has solved the problem of CF in a better way. A system of this kind is commonly constructed based upon social network with trust relations. It contains not only user-item rating relations, but also friendships between users, and the friendships are very meaningful in recommendation. However, the trust values in the networks are all specified by users, which are subjective processes. In this paper, we propose a Top-K recommender system on social tagging network, and design a user-item rating matrix construction method on user browsed or searched information. We use tags, which can be regarded as users and items feature information, to compute the similarity between users or items. Moreover, we propose a Top-K recommender system construction method on the network with trust values computed from users' interest similarity. In our experiments we use the Last fm dataset, and we employ the RMSE and hit-radios benchmarks to evaluate the quality and performance of prediction on single item and Top-K recommendation. We compare our approach with two traditional CF algorithms. The experimental results show that our system has good performance, and it solves the defects of CF and existing Trust-based recommender systems. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={While recent progress has been achieved in understanding the structure and dynamics of social tagging systems, we know little about the underlying user motivations for tagging, and how they influence resulting folksonomies and tags. This paper addresses three issues related to this question. (1) What distinctions of user motivations are identified by previous research, and in what ways are the motivations of users amenable to quantitative analysis? (2) To what extent does tagging motivation vary across different social tagging systems? (3) How does variability in user motivation influence resulting tags and folksonomies? In this paper, we present measures to detect whether a tagger is primarily motivated by categorizing or describing resources, and apply these measures to datasets from seven different tagging systems. Our results show that (a) users' motivation for tagging varies not only across, but also within tagging systems, and that (b) tag agreement among users who are motivated by categorizing resources is significantly lower than among users who are motivated by describing resources. Our findings are relevant for (1) the development of tag-based user interfaces, (2) the analysis of tag semantics and (3) the design of search algorithms for social tagging systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Assessing the quality of the clustering process is fundamental in unsupervised clustering. In literature we can find three different clustering validity techniques: external criteria; internal criteria and relative criteria. In this paper, we focus on external criteria and present an algorithm that allows the implementation of external measures to assess clustering quality when the structure of the data set is unknown. To obtain an automatic partition of a data set and to reflect how documents must be grouped according to human intuition we use internal information present in data like descriptions provide by the users as tags and the distance between documents. The results show an evident correlation between manual and automatic classes indicating it is acceptable to use an automatic partition. In addition to presenting an alternative to finding the structure of the data set using meta-data such as tags, we also wanted to test the impact of their integration in the k-means++ algorithm and verify how it influences the quality of the formed clusters, suggesting a model of integration based on the occurrence of tags in document content. The experimental results indicate a positive impact when external measures are calculated, although there was no apparent correlation between the weight assigned to the tags and the quality of the obtained clusters. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Social annotations provide additional document description contributed by online users and they have been explored for improving search performance. However, most existing methods need offline analysis of the whole tagged corpus, which is computationally expensive and cannot fit specific queries well. In this paper, we propose to use tags for document re-ranking. Specifically, we first estimate document similarity by combining words and tags and then adjust the document ranks with the assumption that similar documents should have similar retrieval scores. On similarity estimation, we present a new feature extraction method, called CRMF, from which document similarity can be derived. The CRMF can integrate the content and relation properties of multiple views and mine their correspondence. Besides, it does not require that all the documents to have tags. We tested the proposed approach on collections which are derived from Clue Web and contain Delicious tags. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tags on document re-ranking, where CRMF is significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods using tags. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging systems, which allow users to freely annotate online resources with tags, become popular in the Web 2.0 era. In order to ease the annotation process, research on social tag recommendation has drawn much attention in recent years. Modeling the social tagging behavior could better reflect the nature of this issue and improve the result of recommendation. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for bringing the associative ability to model the social tagging behavior and then to enhance the performance of automatic tag recommendation. To simulate human tagging process, our approach ranks the candidate tags on a weighted digraph built by the semantic relationships among meaningful words in the summary and the corresponding tags for a given resource. The semantic relationships are learnt via a word alignment model in statistical machine translation on large datasets. Experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our method is effective, robust and language-independent compared with the stateof- The-art methods. © 2012 The Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={Over the past years, several Open Educational Resources (OERs) initiatives have been emerged worldwide aiming to create, share and reuse digital educational resources among educational communities. As a result, organizing, offering and accessing these resources over the web have been key issues for both the research and the educational community. Traditionally, a popular way for characterizing digital educational resources is by using a formal and centrally agreed classification system, such as the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (LOM). On the other hand, with the emerging Web 2.0 applications, the issue of characterizing digital educational resources tends to move from the expert-based description based on formal classification systems to a less formal user-based tagging referred to as social tagging. As a result, a number of studies have been reported in the field of Technology-enhanced Learning (TeL) aiming to evaluate whether social tagging can improve the discovery of new digital educational resources and the retrieval of known ones stored in web-based repositories. Additionally, recent studies in the field of social tagging systems has provided initial evidence that users' tagging motivation has a direct influence on the properties of the resulted tags and folksonomies. Thus, in this paper we aim to propose a methodology for investigating this issue and examine whether different end-users' tagging motivations (that is teachers) could enlarge the metadata descriptions of digital educational resources. The results of our study provided us evidence that there is a direct influence of users' tagging motivation on the enlargement of metadata descriptions of digital educational resources, as well as to the resulted folksonomy when it is compared with formal structured vocabularies used by metadata experts or content providers for characterizing digital educational resources.},

abstract={In recent years, tagging methods have been widely used on the Web for multimedia search and recommendation systems. Social tags are the keywords annotated by users to the multimedia objects. These tags contain the information which allows multimedia objects to be located and classified. Unfortunately, irrelevant information and noise are frequently included in such tags, especially when we use social tagging systems. Imperfect as they may be, social tags are still a significant source of human-generated contextual knowledge. We present the Waking And Sleeping (WAS) algorithm to overcome the obstacle of noisy tags. WAS refines social tags of each image and assigns each tag into either the waking state or the sleeping state. With WAS, the recommendation system not only enhances the accuracy of the recommendation results based on tags with higher quality but also reduces the consumption of computational resources. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to compared methods. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergence of social tagging and crowdsourcing systems provides a unique platform where multiple weak labelers can form a crowd to fulfill a labeling task. Yet crowd labelers are often noisy, inaccurate, and have limited labeling knowledge, and worst of all, they act independently without seeking complementary knowledge from each other to improve labeling performance. In this paper, we propose a Self-Taught Active Learning (STAL) paradigm, where imperfect labelers are able to learn complementary knowledge from one another to expand their knowledge sets and benefit the underlying active learner. We employ a probabilistic model to characterize the knowledge of each labeler through which a weak labeler can learn complementary knowledge from a stronger peer. As a result, the self-taught active learning process eventually helps achieve high classification accuracy with minimized labeling costs and labeling errors. © 2012 IEEE.},

In order to uncover their hidden semantics, several researches have attempted to induce an ontology-like taxonomy from tags.

In this paper, we propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering framework which relies only on how similar every two tags are. We enhance our framework by integrating it with a topic model to capture thematic correlations among tags. By experimenting on a designated online tagging system, we show that our method can disclose new semantic structures that supplement the output of previous approaches.

abstract={Social influences, the phenomena that one individual's actions can induce similar behaviors among his/her friends via their social ties, have been observed prevailingly in socially networked systems. While most existing work focuses on studying general, macro-level influence (e.g., diffusion); equally important is to understand social influence at microscopic scales (i.e., at the granularity of single individuals, actions, and time-stamps), which may benefit a range of applications. We propose μSI, a microscopic social-influence model wherein: individuals' actions are modeled as temporary interactions between social network (formed by individuals) and object network (formed by targets of actions); one individual's actions influence his/her friends in a dynamic, network-wisemanner (i.e., dependent on both social and object networks). We develop for μSI a suite of novel inference tools that enable to answer questions of the form: How may an occurred interaction trigger another? More importantly, when and where may a new interaction be observed? We carefully address the computational challenges for inferencing over such semantically rich models by dynamically identifying sub-domains of interest and varying the precision of solutions over different subdomains. We demonstrate the breadth and generality of μSI using two seemingly disparate applications. In the context of social tagging service, we show how it can help improve the accuracy and freshness of resource recommendation; in the context of mobile phone call service, we show how it can help improve the efficiency of paging operation.

abstract={The power law distribution of social tag frequency is one of the most important statistic characteristics in social tagging system. Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, social tagging systems become more and more popular in many Web 2.0 applications. In such systems, Users are allowed to annotate a particular resource with a freely chosen a set of tags. These user-generated tags can represent users' interests more concise and closer to human understanding. Interests will change over time. Thus, how to describe users' interests and interests transfer path become a big challenge for personalized recommendation systems. In this approach, we propose a variable-length time interval division algorithm and user interest model based on time interval. Then, in order to draw users' interests transfer path over a specific time period, we suggest interest transfer model. After that, we apply a classical community partition algorithm in our approach to separate users into communities.

abstract={Content-based social tagging recommendation, which considers the relationship between the tags and the descriptions contained in resources, is proposed to remedy the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering. There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods. © 2012 IEEE.},

Cost-sensitive learning is a natural approach toward unsupervised visual concept learning because it fundamentally optimizes the learning system accuracy regarding the cost of an error.

abstract={Public online social network services have achieved dazzling success in recent years. As a result, vertical social network services for universities are expected warmly by campus users. As the majority of activities in university campus are knowledge and social interaction intensive, one of the core functions of campus social network system is to facilitate knowledge sharing on campus. In the cyberspace of universities, knowledge is stored in various kinds of digital resources such as documents, photos, videos etc. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of our campus social network system, concentrating on knowledge sharing mechanism in the system. The knowledge sharing mechanism has five features including the utilization of users' personal social network to facilitate the dissemination of digital resources, the use of a six-tuple model based tagging to realize the unified labeling for digital resources, the fine- grained access control based on friend lists for safer knowledge sharing, the adoption of a multi-scale evaluation method for digital resources and personalized recommendation for digital resource with social graph based collaborative filtering as its core idea. With all these considerations, we expect to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge while enlarging the dissemination scope of digital resources carrying it in cyberspace of universities.},

abstract={The common usage of tags in these systems is to add the tagging attribute as an additional feature to re-model users or resources over the tag vector space, and in turn, making tag-based recommendation or personalized recommendation. With the help of tagging data, user annotation preference and document topical tendency are substantially coded into the profiles of users or documents. However, obtaining the proper relationship among user, resource and tag is still a challenge in social annotation based recommendation researches. In this paper, we utilize the relationship from between tags and resources and between tags and users to extract group information. With the help of such relationship, we can obtain the Topic-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and resources, and Interest-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and users. The preliminary experiments have been conducted on Movie Lens dataset to compare our proposed approach with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation approach approach in terms of precision, and the result demonstrates that our approach could considerably improve the performance of recommendations. © 2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposed a latent Dirichlet allocation like probabilistic approach, which modeled user autonomy information such as one's preferences on tag and resource use, to provide autonomy oriented personalized tag recommendations. The parameters of the proposed method were estimated following a Gibbs sampling approach, which allowed a quick calculation of the values. Experiment results showed that the proposed approach can provide personalized tag recommendations with higher quality.},

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach by making use of enhanced social context to aid personalized summary generation. In the proposed method, document expansion, user expansion, and implicit induction of the intended user's interest aspects are achieved simultaneously by adopting a fuzzy tripartite clustering algorithm. And both the informativeness of sentences and the user's interest aspects are incorporated in a unified ranking process. Preliminary experimental results on a social tagging dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2012 The COLING.},

abstract={Originally introduced by social bookmarking systems, collaborative tagging, or social tagging, has been widely adopted by many web-based systems like wikis, e-commerce platforms, or social networks. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Firstly, the reduced user-book-tag tensor model is adjusted by the interest transferring curves, which fitted by the temporal tagging behavior of each tags. Then, the candidate social tags are extracted from the social community by the rebuild User-Tag matrix C. After constructing the user model and the item model by matrix factorization, the books with the highest posterior of the tags are recommended by the naïve Bayes classifier.

A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to measure our approach. Our evaluation shows that the topic sense induction in a folksonomy allows for precise and complete search, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social tagging is one of the most important ways to organize and index online resources. Recommendation in social tagging systems, e.g. tag recommendation, item recommendation and user recommendation, is used to improve the quality of tags and to ease the tagging or searching process. Existing works usually provide recommendations by analyzing relation information in social tagging systems, suffering a lot from the over sparse problem. These approaches ignore information contained in the content of resources, which we believe should be considered to improve recommendation quality and to deal with the over sparse problem. In this paper we propose a recommendation approach for social tagging systems that combines content and relation analysis in a single model. By modeling the generating process of social tagging systems in a latent Dirichlet allocation approach, we build a fully generative model for social tagging, leverage it to estimate the relation between users, tags and resources and achieve tag, item and user recommendation tasks. The model is evaluated using a CiteULike data snapshot, and results show improvements in metrics for various recommendation tasks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Web document clustering is one of the most important research branches of Clustering Analyzing. The objective of web document clustering is to meet the need of retrieving web document efficiently from massive information in Internet. Recently social tagging is the important form of document organization in web 2.0, and the tagging as a document descriptor is used to improve the effectiveness of web searching. But a web document usually belongs to various category of tagging, which may lead to the difficulty of browsing web document based on single tagging. This paper explores the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as mathematical tool to analyze the social tagging of web document, and presents a model for web document clustering based on tagging semantic. Furthermore, taking community web site Douban as an example, the model is applied to allow users to tag and serendipitously browse web document using Formal Concept Analysis. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Web search that utilizes social tagging data suffers from an extreme example of the vocabulary mismatch problem encountered in traditional Information Retrieval (IR). This is due to the personalized, unrestricted vocabulary that users choose to describe and tag each resource. Previous research has proposed the utilization of query expansion to deal with search in this rather complicated space. However, non-personalized approaches based on relevance feedback and personalized approaches based on co-occurrence statistics have only demonstrated limited improvements. This paper proposes an Iterative Personalized Query Expansion Algorithm for Web Search (iPAW), which is based on individual user profiles mined from the annotations and resources the user has marked. The method also incorporates a user model constructed from a co-occurrence matrix and from a Tag-Topic model where annotations and web documents are connected in a latent graph. The experimental results suggest that the proposed personalized query expansion method can produce better results than both the classical non-personalized search approach and other personalized query expansion methods. An "adaptivity factor" was further investigated to adjust the level of personalization. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

LC plays a vital part in discipline creation and maintenance, as it actively reproduces specific discourses, while silencing others, such as those from the humanities, social sciences, and the general public. Alternatively, social tagging seems to disregard conventions of disciplinarity and allows much more diversity of representations. Tagging may provide important insight for organizing materials in research libraries, as choices between single disciplines are no longer necessary and voices from various fields and audiences can name resources using their own terms, whether they prefer medical/technical jargon or everyday words. As the academy moves more toward interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary studies and aims to find the intersections across political, social, scientific, and cultural phenomena, the implications and effects of library organization based on classes and subjects needs to be interrogated.},

abstract={The perception of art is a subjective affair - being influenced by our feelings, education and cultural background. Contrary, the study of art history uses formal methods to classify artworks. This discrepancy often poses a risk of being insurmountable - especially for users without prior knowledge of art history. The concept of social tagging provides the possibility to merge art historical information with the subjective perception of users. For our art Web platform explorARTorium, social tags augment exiting art historical information. In order to better understand how social tagging is best applied, it is necessary to examine the user's motivation to assign tags. We adopt the differentiation between users who are motivated by categorizing, and users who are motivated by describing resources. By evaluating our folksonomy according to this paradigm, we show that the preference for certain artworks has an effect on the user's tagging motivation, whereas the presentation of an artwork does not. While measures exist that are able to identify the user's motivation for annotating artworks, we propose an heuristic that aims to classify categorizing, respectively descriptive, tags. After evaluating this proposed heuristic, we show that it is indeed possible to identify categorizing and descriptive tags, even though the results are somewhat biased by the content of the resources and the individual tagging behaviour of the users. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Purely hierarchical classification schemes such as taxonomies have been the primary means for knowledge organization for millennia and are still predominant in current information systems, for example in the form of hierarchical menus or folder hierarchies. However, due to the growing amount of digital information as well as improved technical possibilities, other organization schemes such as faceted classification schemes or so-called folksonomies, the result of social tagging activity, recently gained popularity. While these approaches address particular shortcomings of purely hierarchical organization of information, they exhibit certain characteristics limiting their general applicability. In this paper, we first give an overview of the particular strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to knowledge organization. Subsequently, we present a formal model of TACKO, a novel organization scheme that is inspired by the flexibility of tagging systems, i.e., the assignment of keywords to information resources, and incorporates elements of hierarchical and faceted organization schemes, so it can be considered a synthesis of the aforementioned schemes. We illustrate TACKO using a small example scenario. Additionally, we present a user interface for our approach, that we implemented in a modern web-based collaboration software. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Contextual factors can greatly inuence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discov- ered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to postfilter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.

abstract={With the growing popularity of social tagging, more and more images are annotated by users on web sites(e.g., Flickr, Blogspace and Youtube). Since the tags annotated by users are often noisy, ambiguous, and subjective, it is beneficial to fully utilize the multiview information and borrow strength from multiple data sources to boost the performance of image annotation and tag-based image retrieval. Therefore, the appropriate integration and utilization of complimentary cues from multiple modality in multiple data sources is an important research topic. Inspired by the recent advances of multiview learning and shared subspace learning, this paper proposes an approach, namely Multimodality Multi-source Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M2NMF) to learn a shared and corresponding individual structures from multimodality data via nonnegative matrix factorization. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A famous Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka left a statement "The whole is other than the sum of its parts." Similarly, collective intelligence such as social tagging exposes a social milieu that cannot be obtained from the descriptions of each individual. Previous automatic (or passive) life logging projects mainly focused on recording the individual life activity however, sometimes it is difficult to recollect the situation from their own perspective logs alone. In this project, we propose a social life logging system called "KiokuHacker" (Kioku means memory in Japanese) that encourages the user to describe their life activity by using a massive amount of processed geotagged social tagging from the Internet. The result of a one year user test not only shows that our social life logging system encourages the user's reminiscence which the user cannot recollect by oneself but also indicates that the user evokes their reminiscence which is not directly related with to the tags/scenes the system displayed.

abstract={Previous metric learning approaches learn a unified metric for all the classes on single feature representation, thus cannot be directly transplanted to applications involving multiple features, hundreds to thousands of hierarchical structured semantics and abundant social tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task multi-feature metric learning method which models the information sharing mechanism among different learning tasks. We decompose the real world multi-class problems such as semantic categorization or automatic tagging into a set of tasks where each task corresponds to several classes with strong visual correlation. We conduct metric learning to learn a set of (hyper)category-specific metrics for all the tasks. By encouraging model sharing among tasks, more generalization power is acquired. Another advantage is the capability of simultaneous learning with semantic information and social tagging based on the multi-task learning framework, and thus they both benefit from the information provided by each other. Experiments demonstrate the advantages on applications including semantic categorization and automatic tagging compared with other popular metric learning approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, the use of social networking has been transitioning from the recreational to more formal uses in corporate and educational contexts. As more businesses begin to adopt social networking as a means of communication and collaboration in the workplace, the effective use of social networks by students for formal communication (as opposed to recreational or informal) becomes an imperative skill for achieving efficiency and productivity. In this paper, we discuss our experience with different social networking sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Google+) to engage learners in various computer science courses at Miami University. Based on our experience, we have categorized the strengths and weaknesses of using different social networks by looking at generic activities that happen within the workplace and then identifying how a particular social network feature supports the given activity. Specifically, our experience encompasses several different use cases including using status updates as a means for addressing technical issues, social tagging to mark areas of interest, and video teleconferencing for virtual office hours. Our observations reflect some interesting trends in academic achievement and student engagement which may have implications for future use of social networks in education and, in turn, in the workplace.},

abstract={A social tagging system provides users an effective way to collaboratively annotate and organize items with their own tags. A social tagging system contains heterogeneous information like users' tagging behaviors, social networks, tag semantics and item profiles. All the heterogeneous information helps alleviate the cold start problem due to data sparsity. In this paper, we model a social tagging system as a multi-type graph. To learn the weights of different types of nodes and edges, we propose an optimization framework, called OptRank. OptRank can be characterized as follows:(1) Edges and nodes are represented by features. Different types of edges and nodes have different set of features. (2) OptRank learns the best feature weights by maximizing the average AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of the tag recommender. We conducted experiments on two publicly available datasets, i.e., Delicious and Last.fm. Experimental results show that: (1) OptRank outperforms the existing graph based methods when only (user, tag, item) relation is available. (2) OptRank successfully improves the results by incorporating social network, tag semantics and item profiles. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging systems allow users to publish different type of resources, such as Web pages or pictures, annotate them using keywords or tags and share their resources with other users. These systems achieved widespread success on the Web on account of the simplicity for organizing resources using open-ended tags. Recently, tag recommendation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problems of ambiguity, syntactic variations and noise in tags cause by the inherent characteristics of natural language. In this work we proposed a content-based approach that generates a list of suggested tags for annotating a given resource starting from an analysis of its textual content exclusively. Thus, the proposed method can be used in situations in which there is not enough information for creating a tag-based user profile or compare the user with others. For extracting the more relevant words different term weighting approaches were evaluated, particularly considering the HTML structure of Web pages and the grammatical category of words in order to determine promising tag candidates. Experimental results of applying this technique to tag recommendation using several term weighting approaches are reported and compared. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Regarding to the complex network composed of the vast amount of tags in social tagging systems in Internet with their co-occurrences, the weights as the statistical semantic similarity of tag-tag edges and two abstract operators for weights computation were introduced, and a model of tag semantic similarity measurement is established. Comparing with traditional "users-items-tags" tripartite graph based statistic measures or network topology focused nodes similarity measures, this model provides a well defined formal system, which explicitly addresses both the statistical influential factors and the topological influential factors in computation of tag semantic similarities. A cluster of concrete implementations of the abstract operators are devised, which have similar format with T norms and S norms in fuzzy logics. In this cluster, concrete operators of different types or addressing different scopes of network topological factors are configurated with particular parameters (e. g., parameter h and order l). By incorporating the AUC index and precision index in link prediction of complex network, an experiment is conducted to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of these concrete operators. The experimental results show that these concrete operators introduce the effects of "semantic complementation" as well as the effects of "semantic destruction" when they are applied, but lower ordered calculations (e. g., 2 ≤ l ≤ 5 in the model) with these operators are helpful for precise analysis of tag semantic similarities, therefore they are useful in devising high accurate tag-aware recommendation algorithms for social tagging systems.},

abstract={Social tagging and controlled indexing both facilitate access to information resources. Given the increasing popularity of social tagging and the limitations of controlled indexing (primarily cost and scalability), it is reasonable to investigate to what degree social tagging could substitute for controlled indexing. In this study, we compared CiteULike tags to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for 231,388 citations indexed in MEDLINE. In addition to descriptive analyses of the data sets, we present a paper-by-paper analysis of tags and MeSH terms: the number of common annotations, Jaccard similarity, and coverage ratio. In the analysis, we apply three increasingly progressive levels of text processing, ranging from normalization to stemming, to reduce the impact of lexical differences. Annotations of our corpus consisted of over 76,968 distinct tags and 21,129 distinct MeSH terms. The top 20 tags/MeSH terms showed little direct overlap. On a paper-by-paper basis, the number of common annotations ranged from 0.29 to 0.5 and the Jaccard similarity from 2.12% to 3.3% using increased levels of text processing. At most, 77,834 citations (33.6%) shared at least one annotation. Our results show that CiteULike tags and MeSH terms are quite distinct lexically, reflecting different viewpoints/processes between social tagging and controlled indexing. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Social tags have recently become popular for use as keywords for searching and annotating Web resources. The main limitation of using social tags is the focus on the keyword and human interpretability rather than on semantics and computer interpretability. Hence, although social tags are useful for information sharing and organizing, they lack the semantic metadata needed for the reasoning and inference functions that facilitate a personalized Web resource search. This study addresses this issue by defining a Semantic Tag-based Profile Framework (STPF) for integrating ontology technologies into user profiles and Web resource annotations. The proposed STPF is applied in a novel algorithm for automatically generating user profiles by combining the traditional term frequency scheme and the semantic technology. A Semantic Tag-based User Profile Platform (STUPP) based on the proposed STPF and algorithm is also used as a broker for personalized Web resource searches made for individual needs. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has higher precision and recall than the traditional term frequency scheme. © 2011 The Author.

abstract={Algorithms for constructing hierarchical structures from user-generated metadata have caught the interest of the academic community in recent years. In social tagging systems, the output of these algorithms is usually referred to as folksonomies (from folk-generated taxonomies). Evaluation of folksonomies and folksonomy induction algorithms is a challenging issue complicated by the lack of golden standards, lack of comprehensive methods and tools as well as a lack of research and empirical/simulation studies applying these methods. In this article, we report results from a broad comparative study of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms that we have applied and evaluated in the context of five social tagging systems. In addition to adopting semantic evaluation techniques, we present and adopt a new technique that can be used to evaluate the usefulness of folksonomies for navigation. Our work sheds new light on the properties and characteristics of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms and introduces a new pragmatic approach to folksonomy evaluation, while at the same time identifying some important limitations and challenges of folksonomy evaluation. Our results show that folksonomy induction algorithms specifically developed to capture intuitions of social tagging systems outperform traditional hierarchical clustering techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the largest and most comprehensive evaluation study of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms to date. © 2012 ACM.},

When the user logged for first time his/her profile is null which is critical problem in these systems, so by using approach based on collaboration any similar user for this user is not found which represent Cold-Start problem.In this issue we proposed tag based on resource recommendation system which can help to user in select suitable resources. In this system offers to user based on user's personal interests, interests of similar users, content resources, databases which associated with ontology and related words. The present method resolved Cold-Start problem in the beginning executes system by combined and integrated methods based on content, collaboration, related words and user profile that means it is greatest advantage of present system rather than previous systems. The proposed system's evaluation performed on a dataset collected from Delicious.com. Evaluation results of proposed method illustrate this method general quality of recommendations that has been improved. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The usage of digital content on social web-based systems is becoming a part of human daily life. Social bookmarking for academic papers is an example of social web-based systems that allow researchers from all over the world to create their own research communities, share interesting research papers to others, and find other researchers who are working in similar research areas. An approach that may help the system to improve search results is personalized re-ranking. This method investigates user profiles by creating personalized algorithms. This paper proposes a persona lized reranking technique for academic paper searching. The assumptions of this work are studying the performance of the profiler and combining the result with another factor to improve search results. The experimental results show that social tagging is suitable for creating a user profile. Consequently, the year of paper publication was combined with a personalized re-ranking technique called "PTYRank" which provides the best personalized re-ranking technique for academic paper by using a weight score with 80:20 ratio. This implies that search result of personalized re-ranking by using "Tag, Title and Abstract" to create indices and using social tagging from researcher individual profiles can be used to create user profiles. Moreover static ranking can also be combined to effectively improve the performance of the academic paper searching.},

abstract={Recent years have seen an increasing diffusion of online communities giving their members the ability of specifying and sharing metadata concerning online resources. Such practice, also known as social or collaborative tagging, has the purpose of collecting and sharing opinions about Web resources and simplifying their retrieval. In this paper, we go one step further and show how tags can have more enhanced applications to be exploited for customizing Web content fruition. More precisely, we propose a multi-layer framework where data collected by social tagging communities are complemented with additional services. Such services provide users the ability of expressing their dis/agreement with existing tags, denoting the members they trust based on their characteristics and relationships, or specifying policies on which "quality" assessment of resources should be returned. Besides providing the formal specification of the proposed framework, we illustrate two case studies we have implemented and the experiments we have carried out in order to verify the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Recently, the use of social networking has been transitioning from the recreational to more formal uses in corporate and educational contexts. As more businesses begin to adopt social networking as a means of communication and collaboration in the workplace, the effective use of social networks by students for formal communication (as opposed to recreational or informal) becomes an imperative skill for achieving efficiency and productivity. In this paper, we discuss our experience with different social networking sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Google+) to engage learners in various computer science courses at Miami University. Based on our experience, we have categorized the strengths and weaknesses of using different social networks by looking at generic activities that happen within the workplace and then identifying how a particular social network feature supports the given activity. Specifically, our experience encompasses several different use cases including using status updates as a means for addressing technical issues, social tagging to mark areas of interest, and video teleconferencing for virtual office hours. Our observations reflect some interesting trends in academic achievement and student engagement which may have implications for future use of social networks in education and in turn in the workplace. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.},

abstract={Social communication websites has been an emerging type of a Web service that helps users to share their resources. For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Over the past years, the number of available informatics resources in medicine has grown exponentially. While specific inventories of such resources have already begun to be developed for Bioinformatics (BI), comparable inventories are as yet not available for the Medical Informatics (MI) field, so that locating and accessing them currently remains a difficult and time-consuming task. Description: We have created a repository of MI resources from the scientific literature, providing free access to its contents through a web-based service. We define informatics resources as all those elements that constitute, serve to define or are used by informatics systems, ranging from architectures or development methodologies to terminologies, vocabularies, databases or tools. Relevant information describing the resources is automatically extracted from manuscripts published in top-ranked MI journals. We used a pattern matching approach to detect the resources names and their main features. Detected resources are classified according to three different criteria: functionality, resource type and domain. To facilitate these tasks, we have built three different classification schemas by following a novel approach based on folksonomies and social tagging. We adopted the terminology most frequently used by MI researchers in their publications to create the concepts and hierarchical relationships belonging to the classification schemas. The classification algorithm identifies the categories associated with resources and annotates them accordingly. The database is then populated with this data after manual curation and validation. Conclusions: We have created an online repository of MI resources to assist researchers in locating and accessing the most suitable resources to perform specific tasks. The database contains 609 resources at the time of writing and is available at http://www.gib.fi.upm.es/ eMIR2. We are continuing to expand the number of available resources by taking into account further publications as well as suggestions from users and resource developers. © 2012 de la Calle et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Keywords have played an important role not only for searchers who formulate a query, but also for search engines that index documents and evaluate the query. Recently, tags chosen by users to annotate web resources are gaining significance for improving information retrieval (IR) tasks, in that they can act as meaningful keywords bridging the gap between humans and machines. One critical aspect of tagging (besides the tag and the resource) is the user (or tagger); there exists a ternary relationship among the tag, resource, and user. The traditional inverted index, however, does not consider the user aspect, and is based on the binary relationship between term and document. In this paper we propose a social inverted index-a novel inverted index extended for social-tagging-based IR-that maintains a separate user sublist for each resource in a resource-posting list to contain each user's various features as weights. The social inverted index is different from the normal inverted index in that it regards each user as a unique person, rather than simply count the number of users, and highlights the value of a user who has participated in tagging. This extended structure facilitates the use of dynamic resource weights, which are expected to be more meaningful than simple user-frequency-based weights. It also allows a flexible response to the conditional queries that are increasingly required in tag-based IR. Our experiments have shown that this user-considering indexing performs better in IR tasks than a normal inverted index with no user sublists. The time and space overhead required for index construction and maintenance was also acceptable. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Social or collaborative tagging systems emerged as a novel classification scheme on the Web based on the collective knowledge of people. In sites such as Del.icio.us, Technorati or Flickr, users annotate a variety of resources, including Web pages, blogs, pictures, videos or bibliographic references; using freely chosen textual labels or tags. Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web. In this paper we present an empirical study carried out to determine the value of tags in resource classification. Furthermore, the use of several filtering and pre-processing operations to reduce the ambiguity and noise in tags are analyzed to determine whether they allow to increase the quality of resource classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Several approaches have been proposed to visualize tag relations in these systems. However, results of previous research rely on qualitative evaluation methods, and do not provide robust and sound comparison criteria. In order to allow quantitative evaluation we present a benchmark social tagging dataset, where a subset of 140 tags from a well-known social bookmarking site, delicious, have been manually categorized according to the open directory project (ODP). The manual categorization is utilized as a ground truth that enables quantitative evaluation providing a way of inferring the best of different clustering approaches. With this dataset we also explore different tag representation approaches to present a reorganized tag cloud by using self organizing maps. In addition, we present an approach to enrich the resultant tag cloud with the most characteristic terms for each tag and group of tags, making possible a further filtered navigation, both by tag and document content, and easing a deeper qualitative evaluation of the clusters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The JPSearch standard is composed of six parts, which are Part 1: System framework and components, Part 2: Registration, identification and management of schema and ontology, Part 3: Query format, Part 4: File format for metadata embedded in image data (JPEG and JPEG 2000), Part 5: Data interchange format between image repositories, Part 6: Reference software. The Part 1 provides motivation and overview of the JPSearch framework. The Part 2 supports interoperability among various metadata specifications and social tagging using the specification of core metadata and translation rule description language. The Part 3 provides powerful image query language for interoperability among multiple image databases. The Part 4 specifies a file format based on JPEG and JPEG 2000 file format in which arbitrary number of metadata description of a image can be embedded. The Part 5 supports interoperability in interchanging images with metadata between image repositories. Finally, the Part 6 provides reference and utility softwares based on which the JPSearch compliant systems can be easily developed.

abstract={In social tagging systems the tagging activities of users leave a huge amount of implicit information about them. The users choose tags for the resources they annotate based on their interests, background knowledge, personal opinion and other criteria. Whilst existing research in mining social tagging data mostly focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the user's interests and the emerging structures in those systems, little work has yet been done to use the rich implicit information in tagging activities to unveil to what degree users' tags convey information about their background. The automatic inference of user background information can be used to complete user profiles which in turn supports various recommendation mechanisms. This work illustrates the application of supervised learning mechanisms to analyze a large online corpus of tagged academic literature for extraction of user characteristics from tagging behavior. As a representative example of background characteristics we mine the user's research discipline. Our results show that tags convey rich information that can help designers of those systems to better understand and support their prolific users - users that tag actively - beyond their interests.

abstract={Although many social tagging systems share a common tripartite graph structure, the collaborative processes that are generating these structures can differ significantly. For example, while resources on Delicious are usually tagged by all users who bookmark the web page cnn.com, photos on Flickr are usually tagged just by a single user who uploads the photo. In the literature, this distinction has been described as a distinction between broad vs. narrow folksonomies. This paper sets out to explore navigational differences between broad and narrow folksonomies in social hypertextual systems. We study both kinds of folksonomies on a dataset provided by Mendeley - a collaborative platform where users can annotate and organize scientific articles with tags. Our experiments suggest that broad folksonomies are more useful for navigation, and that the collaborative processes that are generating folksonomies matter qualitatively. Our findings are relevant for system designers and engineers aiming to improve the navigability of social tagging systems. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Tagging systems allow users to assign arbitrary text labels (i.e., tags) to various types of resources, such as photos or web pages, to facilitate future retrieval and selective sharing of contents. The resulting system of classification is referred to as a folksonomy. The uncontrolled nature of tags leads to inconsistencies in the usage of terms which impairs the utility of the system. Approaches to this problem that map tags to concepts of external knowledge representations, such as ontologies, are often inapplicable since they require that corresponding concepts exist and that they reflect the meaning of tags as intended by the users. In this paper, we present the notion of implicit tag relations. Our aim is to improve the accessibility of contents in tagging systems without significantly reducing the flexibility and universal applicability of tags. Instead of explicitly relating tags to each other, we propose to give users the ability to retroactively alter folksonomies by changing the tags of many resources with a single operation. This way, the usage of tags can be harmonized and it can be controlled how they are used in combination. We highlight the benefits of our approach compared to explicit tag relations and discuss important implications as well as its limitations.},

abstract={In most social networks, measuring similarity between users is crucial for providing new functionalities, understanding the dynamics of such networks, and growing them (e.g., people you may know recommendations depend on similarity, as does link prediction). In this paper, we study a large sample of Flickr user actions and compare tags across different explicit and implicit network relations. In particular, we compare tag similarities in explicit networks (based on contact, friend, and family links), and implicit networks (created by actions such as comments and selecting favorite photos). We perform an in-depth analysis of these five types of links specifically focusing on tagging, and compare different tag similarity metrics. Our motivation is that understanding the differences in such networks, as well as how different similarity metrics perform, can be useful in similarity-based recommendation applications (e.g., collaborative filtering), and in traditional social network analysis problems (e.g., link prediction). We specifically show that different types of relationships require different similarity metrics. Our findings could lead to the construction of better user models, among others. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Latent relationships and patterns can be discovered by applying tensor factorization techniques like Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), Canonical Decomposition etc. STS accumulate large amount of sparse data that restricts factorization techniques to detect latent relations and also significantly slows down the process of a factorization. We propose to reduce tag space by exploiting clustering techniques so that the quality of the recommendations and execution time are improved and memory requirements are decreased. The clustering is motivated by the fact that many tags in a tag space are semantically similar thus the tags can be grouped.

abstract={User-based collaborative filtering is one of the most widely-used recommender methods. It recommends items to a user according to her similar users' opinions. The key point of user-based collaborative filtering is to compute users' similarities. In traditional user-based collaborative filtering, the similarity between two users is determined by their ratings to co-rated items. In some cases, two users rate few common items, such that the similarity between them may be inaccurate and it results in misleading recommendations. With the rapid development of social tagging systems, social tagging data poses new opportunities for recommender systems. Many researchers have proposed different methods to exploit tagging data to improve the performance of recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach to compute users' similarities using the inferred tag ratings. A user's preference for a tag t can be inferred based on her ratings of items tagged with t. A user rates too few such items, then her inferred rating to t may be inaccurate. Hence the relationships among tags are used to infer her preference for t based on all her item ratings, such that the preference of user could be accurate. Experiments were done on the MovieLens data set to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results show that our approach outperform traditional user-based collaborative filtering. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing popularity of social sharing sites, the traditional manual indexing techniques are no longer feasible to cope with the growing amount of multimedia content. Emerging folksonomies of user tags through crowdsourcing provide a potential for the collaborative annotation of various types of online multimedia resources. However, the shortcomings of folksonomies still present researchers with challenges to effectively use the collected user tags in professional or public collections. Examples of such challenges are determining how to tackle the quality of tags, to understand tags' meaning and relevance to the resource material, and to define quality parameters of the final (targeted) annotations of multimedia resources. This work addresses such challenges in a concrete use case - the crowdsourcing video annotation game called Waisda?. This game is used to collect user tags for videos from the Dutch National Audiovisual Archive 'Sound and Vision'. In this paper we explore the interactive aspects of a post-game crowdsourcing tool called 'Tag Gardening' for curating user tags. We tackle the challenges of bringing out quality and extracting meaning from the user tags in order to finally achieve satisfactory video annotations. © 2012 Authors.},

abstract={Social tagging, the process by which users assign tags to resources and share it with each other within their community, has emerged on a number of major and popular music, news, video, and commercial websites, as well as on Social Network Sites, such as Flickr, Technorati, Del.icio.us, Yahoo!, and others. They employ the folksonomy as their core data structure that stores the results of social tagging activity in the systems. Three main elements of social tagging assignments in folksonomies (i.e., users, tags, and resources) can be seen as a rich source of data to be mined for semantic and social insights. Therefore, various data mining techniques to the three main elements as well as the triadic relationships among them are necessary to better understand their characteristics and insights as well as to gain valuable information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a new approach for mining folksonomies based on the triadic class hierarchies. In order to deal with the complexity of the intrinsic triadic relations among users, tags and resources, the triadic equivalent classes and an order relation between them are defined. Based on them, three hierarchical structures can be organized from the triadic context. The class hierarchies of the users, tags and resources can be integrated into a triadic class hierarchy. With some examples, we demonstrate various and complex data of folksonomy can be easily analyzed via a triadic class hierarchy, and show our approach provides some useful and effective ways of analyzing important characteristics on the tagging assignments of the folksonomies. Also, our approach has a wide range of applications and potentialities to explore classify and organize the folksonomies more efficiently. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={Social tagging systems enable users to assign arbitrary tags to various digital resources. However, they face vague-meaning problems when users retrieve or present resources with the keyword-based tags. In order to solve these problems, this study takes advantage of Semantic Web technology and the topological characteristics of knowledge maps to develop a system that comprises a semantic tagging mechanism and triple-pattern and visual searching mechanisms. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and user acceptance of these mechanisms in a knowledge sharing context. The results show that the semantic social tagging system is more effective than a keyword-based system. The visualized knowledge map helps users capture an overview of the knowledge domain, reduce cognitive effort for the search, and obtain more enjoyment. Traditional keyword tagging with a keyword search still has the advantage of ease of use and the users had higher intention to use it. This study also proposes directions for future development of semantic social tagging systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three com-ponents, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by cer-tain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this pa-per, we explore common analysis tasks and propose a dual mining framework for social tagging behavior mining. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, sim-ilarity and diversity, being applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analy-sis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging di-verse items with similar tags, or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags, etc. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We de-sign efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2012 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={We demonstrate the Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tagging systems (also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items from a public pool of items (e.g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a query should be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers' search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully-personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). © 2012 ACM.},

In this model, the results of the statistics based tag relatedness measures are used to extend the topological graph of tags co-occurrence network with weights of edges, two operators are invented to synthetically compute the overall effect of the weights within the extended graph, so that the interplay of semantic co-relations of tags can be explicitly represented and the semantic relatedness of tags can also be measured soundly. To illustrate the calculating process and to testify the validness and feasibility of the calculating results for this model, an experiment is conducted with the set of the most popular tags crawled from Flickr.com, a famous photos sharing website. Experimental results show that the model can lead to better results, and is highly applicable to the guidance and constraint of annotating behaviors in Web2.0 environments.},

abstract={The common ground behind most approaches that analyze social tagging systems is addressing the information challenge that emerges from the massive activity of millions of users who interact and share resources and/or metadata online. However, lack of any time-related data in the analysis process implicitly denies much of the dynamic nature of social tagging activity. In this paper we claim that holding a temporal dimension, allows for tracking macroscopic and microscopic users' interests, detecting emerging trends and recognizing events. To this end, we propose a time-aware co-clustering approach for acquiring semantic and temporal patterns out of the tagging activity. The resulted clusters contain both users and tags of similar patterns over time, and reveal non-obvious or "hidden" relations among users and topics of their common interest. Zoom in & out views serve as visualization methods on different aspects of the clusters' structure, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have gained increasing popularity as a method of annotating and categorizing a wide range of different web resources. Web search that utilizes social tagging data suffers from an extreme example of the vocabulary mismatch problem encountered in traditional information retrieval (IR). This is due to the personalized, unrestricted vocabulary that users choose to describe and tag each resource. Previous research has proposed the utilization of query expansion to deal with search in this rather complicated space. However, non-personalized approaches based on relevance feedback and personalized approaches based on co-occurrence statistics only showed limited improvements. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework based on individual user profiles mined from the annotations and resources the user has marked. The underlying theory is to regularize the smoothness of word associations over a connected graph using a regularizer function on terms extracted from top-ranked documents. The intuition behind the model is the prior assumption of term consistency: the most appropriate expansion terms for a query are likely to be associated with, and influenced by terms extracted from the documents ranked highly for the initial query. The framework also simultaneously incorporates annotations and web documents through a Tag-Topic model in a latent graph. The experimental results suggest that the proposed personalized query expansion method can produce better results than both the classical non-personalized search approach and other personalized query expansion methods. Hence, the proposed approach significantly benefits personalized web search by leveraging users' social media data. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Social Tagging is a recent widespread phenomenon on the Web where people assign labels (tags) to Web resources. It has been hypothesized to support collaborative sensemaking. In this paper, we examine some of the cognitive mechanisms assumed to underlie sensemaking, namely social imitation. In line with the semantic imitation model of Fu et al., we assume that implicit processing can be understood as a semantic reconstruction of gist. Our model contrasts this process with a recall of tags from an explicit verbatim memory trace. We tested this model in an experimental study in which after the search task students had to generate tags themselves. We exposed their answers to a multinomial model derived from Fuzzy Trace Theory to obtain independent parameter estimates for the processes of explicit recall, semantic gist reconstruction and familiarity-based recall. A model that assumes all processes are at play explains the data well. Similar to results of our previous study, we find an influence of search intentions on the two processes. Our results have implications for interface and interaction design of social tagging systems, as well as for tag recommendation in these environments. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={The emergence of social tagging websites such as Last.fm has provided new opportunities for learning computational models that automatically tag music. Researchers typically obtain music tags from the Internet and use them to construct machine learning models. Nevertheless, such tags are usually noisy and sparse. In this paper, we present a preliminary study that aims at refining (retagging) social tags by exploiting the content similarity between tracks and the semantic redundancy of the track-tag matrix. The evaluated algorithms include a graph-based label propagation method that is often used in semi-supervised learning and a robust principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm that has led to state-of-the-art results in matrix completion. The results indicate that robust PCA with content similarity constraint is particularly effective; it improves the robustness of tagging against three types of synthetic errors and boosts the recall rate of music auto-tagging by 7% in a real-world setting.

It also allows enterprise knowledge workers to easily subscribe to new information. It enables self organization of information in conversations while it carefully avoids requiring users to substantially change their usual work-flow of exchanging emails. Incorporating this system in an enterprise improves productivity by: • discovery of connections among employees with converging interests and expertise, similar to social networks naturally leading to formation of interest groups, • avoiding the problem of information lost in mountains of emails, • creating expert profiles by mapping areas of expertise or interests to organizational map.

abstract={Tag-based social image search enables users to formulate queries using keywords. However, as queries are usually very short and users have very different interpretations of a particular tag in annotating and searching images, the returned images to a tag query usually contain a collection of images related to multiple concepts. We demonstrate Casis, a system for concept-aware social image search. Casis detects tag concepts based on the collective knowledge embedded in social tagging from the initial results to a query. A tag concept is a set of tags highly associated with each other and collectively conveys a semantic meaning. Images to a query are then organized by tag concepts. Casis provides intuitive and interactive browsing of search results through a tag concept graph, which visualizes the tags defining each tag concept and their relationships within and across concepts. Supporting multiple retrieval methods and multiple concept detection algorithms, Casis offers superior social image search experiences by choosing the most suitable retrieval methods and concept-aware image organizations.

Design/methodology/approach - Divided equally between developing and advanced economies, a total of 200 government web sites were analysed using content analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings - The prevalence of seven Web 2.0 applications in descending order was: RSS, multimedia sharing services, blogs, forums, social tagging services, social networking services and wikis. More web sites in advanced countries include Web 2.0 applications than those in developing countries. The presence of Web 2.0 applications was found to have a correlation with the overall web site quality, and in particular, service quality. Research limitations/implications - This paper only covers government web sites in English. Emerging genres of Web 2.0 applications such as mashups and virtual worlds have not been included. Moreover the data were drawn solely from the public domain. Practical implications - Decision makers and e-government web developers may benchmark their own efforts in deploying Web 2.0 applications against this study. The numerous exemplars cited here serve as a springboard to generate more ideas on how Web 2.0 applications could be used and harnessed to improve the overall quality of government web sites.

abstract={The quality and user acceptance of personalized services such as personalized information retrieval and navigation or content recommendation depends depends besides the personalization mechanism on the quality, validity and accuracy of the employed user model. In literature a variety of user model construction methods based on tagging activity in social tagging systems (STS) are presented, relying on different user contexts, e.g., the personal or social context. But up to now there is neither a concise overview of existing construction methods available nor a deeper analysis and discussion of the differences between these models. Such an analysis would for example ease evaluation but also enable system designers to choose the most appropriate one. Our work tackles this problem by providing a short overview of state-of-the art user model construction methods which employ social tags. This is followed by a statistical comparison of four different user model construction methods for STS based on tag-frequency. This analysis unveils that depending on the method chosen (based user's personal tagging behavior as well as community-based social strategies), the user model consists of different tags and tag frequency rankings, thus services employing different models will lead to different results.

Our model makes it possible to localize meaningful pieces in sections across the entire digital library. In this way it is possible to, for instance, find similar papers in a highly accurate manner. We are initially working with the entire collection of PubMed Central. Our ultimate goal is to improve information retrieval over our digital library and facilitate the discovery of hidden relationships across papers. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The emergence of social tagging systems enables users to organize and share their interested resources. In order to ease the human-computer interaction with such systems, extensive researches have been done on how to recommend personalized tags for rescources. These researches mainly consider user profile, resource content, or the graph structure of users, resources and tags. Users' preferences towards different tags are usually regarded as invariable against time, neglecting the switch of users' short-term interests. In this paper, we examine the temporal factor in users' tagging behaviors by investigating the occurrence patterns of tags and then incorporate this into a novel method for ranking tags. To assess a tag for a user-resource pair, we first consider the user's general interest in it, then we calculate its recurrence probability based on the temporal usage pattern, and at last we consider its tag relevance to the content of the post. Experiments conducted on real datasets from Bibsonomy and Delicious demonstrate that our method outperforms other temporal models and state-of-the-art tag prediction methods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This mixed methods study is based on a collection of digital images of paintings for which tags in Spanish and English were collected. The results show that the level of agreement in the vocabulary describing an image does not change significantly when adding a second language, but different cultural perspectives can be found for certain images when comparing less frequent tags across languages. Understanding and comparing tagging behaviors across languages is necessary for the design of user interfaces that support diversity and encourage sharing of perspectives about the artwork images. © 2012 ACM.},

T@gz is a system that enables dynamic, non-intrusive and effortless sharing of information within an enterprise and automatically harvests knowledge from such daily interactions. It also allows enterprise knowledge workers to easily subscribe to new information. It enables self organization of information in conversations while it carefully avoids requiring users to substantially change their usual work-ow-of exchanging emails. Incorporating this system in an enterprise improves productivity by: • discovery of connections among employees with converging interests and expertise, similar to social networks naturally leading to formation of interest groups, • avoiding the problem of information lost in mountains of emails, • creating expert profiles by mapping areas of expertise or interests to organizational map. Harvested information includes folksonomy appropriate to an organization, tagged and organized conversations and expertise map. © Copyright WWW Conference 2012.},

abstract={Assessing the value of individual users' contributions in peer-production systems is paramount to the design of mechanisms that support collaboration and improve users' experience. For instance, to incentivize contributions, file sharing systems based on the BitTorrent protocol equate value with volume of contributed content and use a prioritization mechanism to reward users who contribute more. This approach and similar techniques used in resource sharing systems rely on the fact that the physical resources shared among users are easily quantifiable. In contrast, information-sharing systems, like social tagging systems, lack the notion of a physical resource unit (e.g., content size, bandwidth) that facilitates the task of evaluating user contributions. For this reason, the issue of estimating the value of user contributions in information sharing systems remains largely unexplored. This paper outlines a research project to tackle the problem of assessing the value of contributions in social tagging systems.},

To handle the disadvantages of tagging systems such as inconsistentcies, redundancy and incompleteness, tag recommendation methods improve the quality of tags by providing candidate tags. In order to further improve the quality of tag recommendations, a tag recommendation method is proposed which bases on a combined analysis of the relations of objects in a tagging system and the content of resources. An LDA based generative tagging system model TSM/Forc that models object relation and resource content in a combined way is introduced, together with a probabilistic based tag recommendation method and a Gibbs sampling based model parameter estimation approach. Experiment results show that the proposed method could provide more accurate recommendations than the latest methods. © 2012 ISCAS.},

abstract={Many existing studies have investigated to discover a variety of co-occurrence patterns between entities (e.g. users, tags and resources) from a folksonomy system. The common purposes among them are (i) to understand collective behaviors between online users and (ii) to provide online services (e.g. tag recommendation and information searching) to users. However, most of the existing studies assume that all tags in the folksonomy should be written in an identical language. In this paper, we focus on analyzing a multilingual folksonomy generated by various lingual practices of online users, and discovering meaningful relationships between multilingual tags (e.g. between 'Seoul' in English and 'Corée' in French) co-occurred in the folksonomy. Thereby, we propose novel methods for (i) identifying lingual practices from user tagging patterns to build a community of lingual practice and (ii) exploiting the tag matchings to extend simple term-based queries. Thus, additional resources tagged by other languages can be retrieved. To evaluate the proposed multilingual tag matching method, we have collected real tagging datasets from several well-known social tagging websites (e.g. Del.icio.us), and applied to translating queries to other languages without any external dictionaries. © 2011 The Author.

abstract={In recent years, social Web users have been overwhelmed by the huge numbers of social media available. Consequentially, users have trouble finding social media suited to their needs. To help such users retrieve useful social media content, we propose a new model of tag-based personalized searches to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. By leveraging social tagging as a preference indicator, we build two models: (i) a latent tag preference model that reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and (ii) a latent tag annotation model that captures how users have tagged a certain tag to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly map the tags onto items, depending on an individual users query, to find the most desirable content relevant to the users needs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the art algorithms and show our methods feasibility for personalized searches in social media services. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Broken hypertext links are a frequent problem in the Web. Sometimes the page which a link points to has disappeared forever, but in many other cases the page has simply been moved to another location in the same web site or to another one. In some cases the page besides being moved, is updated, becoming a bit different to the original one but rather similar. In all these cases it can be very useful to have a tool that provides us with pages highly related to the broken link, since we could select the most appropriate one. The relationship between the broken link and its possible linkable pages, can be defined as a function of many factors. In this work we have employed several resources both in the context of the link and in the Web to look for pages related to a broken link. From the resources in the context of a link, we have analyzed several sources of information such as the anchor text, the text surrounding the anchor, the URL and the page containing the link. We have also extracted information about a link from the Web infrastructure such as search engines, Internet archives and social tagging systems. We have combined all of these resources to design a system that recommends pages that can be used to recover the broken link. A novel methodology is presented to evaluate the system without resorting to user judgments, thus increasing the objectivity of the results, and helping to adjust the parameters of the algorithm. We have also compiled a web page collection with true broken links, which has been used to test the full system by humans. Results show that the system is able to recommend the correct page among the first ten results when the page has been moved, and to recommend highly related pages when the original one has disappeared. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Depending on the service provider, users can link videos, photos or web sites and describe them with arbitrarily selected tags. The resulting voluntary disclosure of often private information in the internet raises questions concerning the right to control this data. For many of the typical features of social tagging systems (for example recommender systems or the provision of an API) such control mechanisms are difficult to implement.

Previous approaches for finding researchers interests exploit writing styles and links connectivity by considering time of documents, while semantics-based intrinsic structure of words is ignored. Consequently, a topic model named Author-Topic model is proposed, which exploits semantics-based intrinsic structure of words present between the authors of research papers. It ignores simultaneous modeling of time factor which results in exchangeability of topics problem, which is, important factor to deal with when finding dynamic research interests. For example, in many real world applications, like finding reviewers for papers and finding taggers in the social tagging systems one needs to consider different time periods. In this paper, we present time topic modeling approach named Temporal-Author-Topic (TAT) which can simultaneously model text, researchers and time of research papers to overcome the exchangeability of topic problem. The mixture distribution over topics is influenced by both co-occurrences of words and timestamps of the research papers. Consequently, topics occurrence and their related researchers change over time, while the meaning of particular topic almost remains unchanged. Proposed approach is used to discover topically related researchers for different time periods. We also show how their interests and relationships change over a time period. Empirical results on large research papers corpus show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and dominance over Author-Topic (AT) model, by handling the exchangeability of topics problem, which enables it to obtain similar meaning of a particular topic overtime. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Social tagging is an innovative and powerful mechanism introduced by social Web: it shifts the task of classifying resources from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. However, due to the lack of rules for managing the tagging process and of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications do not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing; for this reason the most recent research in this area is dedicated to empower the social perspective applying semantic approaches in order to support tagging, browsing, searching, and adaptive personalization in innovative recommender systems. This paper proposes a survey on existing recommender systems, discussing how they extract social semantic relations (i.e. relations among users, resources and tags of a folksonomy), and how they utilize this knowledge for recommending tags and resources. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

For the current problem of insufficient capacity of semantic web service description, this paper proposes a social tagging method for the web services semantics based on RGPS meta-model framework. The approach uses theories and techniques of MFI international standards and RGPS meta-model framework, enable the public users to annotate the service, as well as amend and improve the tags extracted by the system automatically, identifying service semantic annotation type, and improve semantic integrity of the web service description. Meanwhile, TOS and SRS algorithm is proposed, using RGPS reasoning rules to organize the social tags of service semantics, enable service discovery accurately later. Finally, an experimental example is given to verify this approach, which improves significantly the accuracy and integrity of semantic description of services. © 2012 Binary Information Press January 2012.},

abstract={Social or collaborative tagging enables users to organize and label resources on the web. Libraries and other information environments hope that tagging can complement professional subject access with user-created terms. But who are the taggers, and does their language represent that of the user population? Some language theorists believe that inherent variables, such as gender or race, can be responsible for language use, whereas other researchers endorse more multiply-influenced practice-based approaches, where interactions with others affect language use more than a single variable. To explore whether linguistic variation in tagging is influenced more by gender or context, in this exploratory study, I will analyze the content and quantity of tags used on LibraryThing. This study seeks to dismantle stereotypical views of women's language use and to suggest a community of practice-based approach to analyzing social tags.},

abstract={Tagging in online social networks is very popular these days, as it facilitates search and retrieval of diverse resources available online. However, noisy and spam annotations often make it difficult to perform an efficient search. Users may make mistakes in tagging and irrelevant tags and resources may be maliciously added for advertisement or self-promotion. Since filtering spam annotations and spammers is time-consuming if it is done manually, machine learning approaches can be employed to facilitate this process. In this paper, we propose and analyze a set of distinct features based on user behavior in tagging and tags popularity to distinguish between legitimate users and spammers. The effectiveness of the proposed features is demonstrated through a set of experiments on a dataset of social bookmarks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={Social Tagging has become a method of choice for enriching data (like pictures) with meta-data which in turn can be used for searching (like retrieving art pictures) or tag recommendations relying on Singular Value Decompositions (SVD) to reduce dimensionality. We observed that social tagging-based search or tag-recommendation is more successful, if several dimensions describing the tagging community (like age, interests, cultural background) are considered. In other words, social tagging-based search calls for higher-order, or tensor-based, SVD instead of standard, matrix-based, SVD. This article reports on a parallelization of higher-order SVD which achieves a significantly better time complexity by comparison to single processor approaches. This time complexity is possible thanks to a careful use of Hestenes' SVD. This article also reports on a first experimental evaluation of the approach for a tag recommendation system.},

abstract={Folksonomies such as Delicious, Flickr, and BibSonomy are now widespread with thousands of users using them daily to upload, tag, and retrieve on-line resources (e.g., web pages, photos, and videos). Tags are keywords freely chosen by users that reflect the vocabulary employed by these users to annotate resources. The automatic detection of semantic relations (e.g. synonym, hypernym, and hyponym) between tags may improve the ability of users in finding relevant resources, e.g., queries may be expanded with semantically related tags. Several works in the literature propose approaches to automatically detect semantic relations between tags in folksonomies. In general, these works adopt similarity/distance measures (e.g. edit distance, tag-tag co-occurrence, and cosine) as heuristics for semantic similarity detection. In this paper, we present a more principled approach that learns a pairwise decision model for predicting synonym relations between pairs of tags directly from folksonomy data. The features are extracted from pairs of tags through the application of similarity/distance measures that capture the different aspects of a synonym relation. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on a recent snapshot of BibSonomy, a real-world social tagging system, and show that our approach is up to 8.1% superior than the best performing baseline.},

abstract={Tag recommendation encourages users to add more tags in bridging the semantic gap between human concept and the features of media object, which provides a feasible solution for content-based multimedia information retrieval. In this paper, we study personalized tag recommendation in a popular online photo sharing site - Flickr. Social relationship information of users is collected to generate an online social network. From the perspective of network topology, we propose node topological potential to characterize user's social influence. With this metric, we distinguish different social relations between users and find out those who really have influence on the target users. Tag recommendations are based on tagging history and the latent personalized preference learned from those who have most influence in user's social network. We evaluate our method on large scale real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can outperform the non-personalized global co-occurrence method and other two state-of-the-art personalized approaches using social networks. We also analyze the further usage of our approach for the cold-start problem of tag recommendation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

In the past years, research therefore proposed several models for music sales prediction. These models have, however, some shortcomings which we want to overcome with a new approach. We suggest using a novel data set that is a byproduct of smartphone apps that help users to identify music. Shazam is probably the most popular of these music identification services for smartphones. This study examines the relationship between Shazam charts and song sales using data from the UK over a period from September 2010 to May 2011. Using seemingly unrelated regression we identify that Shazam charts precede sales charts by about two weeks and serve as good predictors for sales charts. Further, we find that the rock, pop, and hip hop genre and artist's popularity positively affect song sales.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe our participation in the INEX 2012 Social Book Search track. We investigate the contribution of different types of document metadata, both social and controlled, and examine the effectiveness of re-ranking retrieval results using different social features, such as user ratings, tags, and authorship information. We find that the best results are obtained using all available document fields and topic representations. Reranking retrieval results works better on shorter topic representations, where there is less information for the retrieval algorithm to work with; longer topic representations do not benefit from our social re-ranking approaches.},

abstract={Mashups have become popular in recent years in the context of Web 2.0 developments. They represent a way of allowing an application to grow beyond the capabilities of its original developers through an incorporation of external functionality. This paper first introduces several approaches to integrating mashups into the Web pages or services, which commonly implement ways to determine which mashups are potentially relevant for display in a certain Web page context. It then describes in detail a novel approach called ActiveTags, which enables users to create reliable mashups based on tags and hence customized views of Web pages with tagged content. A scenario that demonstrates the potential benefits of this approach is presented. Moreover, a formalization is presented which suitably combines previous work on modeling the Web with relational meta-programming, thereby showing that ActiveTags (as well as related approaches) can conceptually be described in terms of the relational model of data.

Traditional studies on prior knowledge generation during language learning have focused on providing additional supplemental materials from reading materials that are manually generated by educators. This is time-consuming and hence personalized prior knowledge recommendation is difficult to perform and monitor. To cope with these problems, we purpose a novel tag-cloud visualization learning approach to automatically monitor running activities and student status. In addition, we incorporate cloud tags into a prior knowledge learning system (TAK), which provides students an engaging way to reinforce meaningful topics, identifies suitable supplementary materials through tag cloud navigation, and helps students reevaluate their reading process. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves the efficiency of prior knowledge learning but also helps teachers assist students in improving their reading ability.},

abstract={The World Wide Web provides a tremendously large quantity of information. When users search for information or products on the Web, they will presumably be inclined to choose their path of navigation on the basis of their prior knowledge. In those cases in which the prior knowledge of users is incorrect, however, this navigation process is assumed to lead to suboptimal search results. In an experimental study with 180 participants, we examined to what extent both the users' prior knowledge and social tags - which capture the collective knowledge of a Web community in tag clouds - influenced the navigation of users and triggered incidental learning processes during the Web search. The results supported the assumption that the users' prior knowledge is indeed crucial for navigation, as users followed those tags which corresponded to their internal associations. Moreover, we found that social tags also affected the navigation behavior of users, as a strong collective association of social tags led to a high selection rate for these tags. Finally, the results showed that social tags triggered incidental learning processes, as those internal associations which corresponded to tags with a strong collective association were strengthened during navigation. The implications of these findings for further research are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Museums have recognized the need for supporting visitors in fulfilling a personalized experience when visiting artwork collections, and they have started to adopt recommender systems as a way to meet this requirement. Content-based recommender systems analyze features of artworks previously rated by a visitor and build a visitor model or profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, based on those features. For example, the profile of a visitor might store the names of his or her favorite painters or painting techniques, extracted from short textual descriptions associated with artworks. The user profile is then matched against the attributes of new items in order to provide personalized suggestions. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution has changed the game for personalization from "elitist" Web 1.0, written by few and read by many, to Web content potentially generated by everyone (user-generated content - UGC). One of the forms of UGC that has drawn most attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this work, we investigate the problem of deciding whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests in the context of recommending digital artworks. We present FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), a content-based recommender system which integrates UGC through social tagging in a classic content-based model, letting users express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as by annotating items with free tags. Experiments show that the accuracy of recommendations increases when tags are exploited in the recommendation process to enrich user profiles, provided that tags are not used as a surrogate for the item descriptions, but in conjunction with them. FIRSt has been developed within the CHAT project "Cultural Heritage fruition & e-learning applications of new Advanced (multimodal) Technologies", and it is the core of a bouquet of Web services designed for personalized museum tours. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Purpose: With the aim of developing a conceptual framework which aims to facilitate semantic metadata interoperability, this paper explores overarching conceptual issues on how traditional library information organisation schemes such as online public access catalogues (OPACs), taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies on the one hand versus Web 2.0 technologies such as social tagging (folksonomies) can be harnessed to provide users with satisfying experiences. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews works in relation to current metadata creation, utilisation and interoperability approaches, focusing on how a social constructivist philosophical perspective can be employed to underpin metadata decisions in digital libraries. Articles are retrieved from databases such as EBSCO host and Emerald and online magazines such as D-Lib and Ariadne. Books, news articles and blog posts that are deemed relevant are also used to support the arguments put forward in this paper. Findings: Current metadata approaches are deeply authoritative and metadata deployments in digital libraries tend to favour an objectivist approach with focus on metadata simplicity. It is argued that unless information objects are enriched with metadata generated through a collaborative and user-driven approach, achieving semantic metadata interoperability in digital libraries will remain difficult. Practical implications: In this paper, it is indicated that the number of metadata elements (fields) constituting a standard has a direct bearing on metadata richness, which in turn directly affects semantic interoperability. It is expected that this paper will contribute towards a better understanding of harnessing user-driven metadata. Originality/value: As suggested in this paper, a conceptual metadata framework underpinned by a social constructivist approach substantially contributes to semantic interoperability in digital libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

By means of process dissociation and a multinomial model we tested our dual-process model (implicit vs. explicit) of social tagging. Findings/Design - We conclude that implicit and explicit processes can be dissociated and that tags are important cues during an information search: they leave robust explicit memory representations. Research limitations/Implications - A laboratory setting was chosen to care for conclusive findings. Our methods may have to be applied in the natural field to increase external validity.

abstract={In social annotation systems, users label digital resources by using tags which are freely chosen textual descriptions. Tags are used to index, annotate and retrieve resource as an additional metadata of resource. Poor retrieval performance remains a major problem of most social tagging systems resulting from the severe difficulty of ambiguity, redundancy and less semantic nature of tags. Clustering method is a useful tool to address the aforementioned difficulties. Most of the researches on tag clustering are directly using traditional clustering algorithms such as K-means or Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering on tagging data, which possess the inherent drawbacks, such as the sensitivity of initialization. In this paper, we instead make use of the approximate backbone of tag clustering results to find out better tag clusters. In particular, we propose an APProximate backbonE-based Clustering algorithm for Tags (APPECT).The main steps of APPECT are: (1) we execute the K-means algorithm on a tag similarity matrix for M times and collect a set of tag clustering results Z = C 1,C 2,...,C m ; (2) we form the approximate backbone of Z by executing a greedy search; (3) we fix the approximate backbone as the initial tag clustering result and then assign the rest tags into the corresponding clusters based on the similarity. Experimental results on three real world datasets namely MedWorm, MovieLens and Dmoz demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method against the traditional approaches. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Then we immerge the two factors into a unified representation.

abstract={Icon system could represent an efficient solution for collective iconic categorization of knowledge by providing graphical interpretation. Their pictorial characters assist visualizing the structure of text to become more understandable beyond vocabulary obstacle. In this paper we are proposing a Knowledge Engineering (KM) based iconic representation approach. We assume that these systematic icons improve collective knowledge management. Meanwhile, text (constructed under our knowledge management model - Hypertopic) helps to reduce the diversity of graphical understanding belonging to different users. This position paper also prepares to demonstrate our hypothesis by an iconic social tagging experiment which is to be accomplished in 2011 with UTT students. We describe the socio semantic web information portal involved in this project, and a part of the icons already designed for this experiment in Sustainability field. We have reviewed existing theoretical works on icons from various origins, which can be used to lay the foundation of robust icons systems. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, a number of algorithms exist for constructing tag hierarchies from social tagging data. While these algorithms were designed with ontological goals in mind, we know very little about their properties from an information retrieval perspective, such as whether these tag hierarchies support efficient navigation in social tagging systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the usefulness of such tag hierarchies (sometimes also called folksonomies - from folk-generated taxonomy) as directories that aid navigation in social tagging systems. To this end, we simulate navigation of directories as decentralized search on a network of tags using Kleinberg's model. In this model, a tag hierarchy can be applied as background knowledge for decentralized search. By constraining the visibility of nodes in the directories we aim to mimic typical constraints imposed by a practical user interface (UI), such as limiting the number of displayed subcategories or related categories. Our experiments on five different social tagging datasets show that existing tag hierarchy algorithms can support navigation in theory, but our results also demonstrate that they face tremendous challenges when user interface (UI) restrictions are taken into account. Based on this observation, we introduce a new algorithm that constructs efficiently navigable directories on our datasets. The results are relevant for engineers and scientists aiming to improve navigability of social tagging systems. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={An important way to improve users' satisfaction in Web search is to assist them to issue more effective queries. One such approach is query refinement (reformulation), which generates new queries according to the current query issued by users. A common procedure for conducting refinement is to generate some candidate queries first, and then a scoring method is designed to assess the quality of these candidates. Currently, most of the existing methods are context based. They rely heavily on the context relation of terms in the historical queries, and cannot detect and maintain the semantic consistency of queries. In this paper, we propose a graphical model to score queries. The proposed model exploits a latent topic space, which is automatically derived from the query log, to assess the semantic dependency of terms in a query. In the graphical model, both term context dependency and topic context dependency are considered. This also makes it feasible to score some queries which do not have much available historical term context information. We also utilize social tagging data in the candidate query generation process. Based on the observation that different users may tag the same resource with different tags of similar meaning, we propose a method to mine these term pairs for new candidate query construction. © 2011 ACM.},

Clustering divides a long list of disparate search results into a few topic-coherent clusters, allowing the user to quickly locate relevant results by topic navigation. While many clustering algorithms have been proposed that innovate on the automatic clustering procedure, we introduce ClusteringWiki, the first prototype and framework for personalized clustering that allows direct user editing of the clustering results. Through a Wiki interface, the user can edit and annotate the membership, structure and labels of clusters for a personalized presentation. In addition, the edits and annotations can be shared among users as a mass-collaborative way of improving search result organization and search engine utility. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The paper's focus is on the analysis of the feasibility of using social tagging as a tool for knowledge collecting and retrieval, in the context of the Product Development Process. This process is a social activity which involves groups of individuals that share a common goal: "to design a product". Traditional Knowledge Base Systems are not very well suited to capture the tacit knowledge that embeds this process. Social tagging is proposed in this paper as the mechanism to externalize the tacit knowledge about the best CAD modeling strategies between the design team members. This knowledge is especially relevant for the management of "Engineering Change Orders" because this process is very related to the modeling methodology used to create the 3D CAD models, that have to be adapted to accomplish a specific design modification. In order to analyze the feasibility of this approach, an experimental study has been conducted to understand the tagging process in this context and the benefit of using this information in the modification procedure of 3D CAD models. Preliminary experimental results show that tagging represents a feasible approach to support knowledge collecting about best CAD modeling practices.},

abstract={In the social tagging systems, tags are the results of users' annotations. The appearance of the tags changes the two-dimensional "user-item" recommendation model into three dimensional "user-tag-item" recommendation model, which brings the traditional recommender systems into a new development direction. Recommender systems have utilized tags for identifying similar resources and generate personalized recommendations. In the paper, we propose a personalized recommendation approach based on community tag clouds. The proposed approach can be realized through the two aspects. Firstly, we cluster items into communities by analyzing the tags they have been annotated by users. At the same time, we can also cluster users into communities by analyzing the tags they have utilized, and assign one tag cloud to each community. Secondly, we calculate the similarity between the item's community tag cloud and user's community tag cloud to make personalized recommendation. The results of empirical evaluation indicate the superiority of the approach in improving the precision and diversity of the recommendation. © 2011 Binary Information Press December, 2011.},

abstract={Social tagging has become a popular solution for recognition and management of resources in Web2.0 era. To solve the current problem of insufficient capacity of semantic description of Web services, a multi-dimensional social tagging approach for Web services semantics is proposed. Under the guidance of social tagging model, users can choose several tags to annotate services from the three sets of recommendation set, candidate set and free set; simultaneously, social tagging framework of service semantics is established from five dimensions of functional semantics, non functional semantics, objective semantics, interactive semantics and complementary semantics, and specific tagging types given, which are divided into machine's annotation and human's annotation, with the support of collective intelligence, machine's tags can be modified and perfected so that the semantic coverage rate of Web service can be enhanced; Moreover, an approach of service semantics emerges automatically is proposed in this paper, through setting the priority of service semantics dimensions, according to frequency to sort the social tags, so that Web services can show semantic information which the public users approve, and which lays the foundation for later discovering the Web services accurately. Finally, experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.},

We then describe a Tag-based Collaborative System (TaCS), meant for supporting social and collaborative learning thanks to tagging, and detail the learning processes expected by the use of the system. We conducted an exploratory study to observe (1) the evolution of the students' tags as an indicator of the learning of new concepts and (2) the evolution of the tags assigned to documents as an indicator of the learning of new conceptual relations. The results show that the students make their tags and their relations to documents evolve, mainly due to two activities: the comparison of individual and collective tag clouds and the negotiation for an agreement on a common tag cloud in the groups. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

The tremendous growth of users require the recommender system to produce tag recommendations for millions of users and items at any minute. The triplets of users, items and tags are most naturally described by a 3D tensor, and tensor decomposition-based algorithms can produce high quality recommendations. However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, ParaFac, and Low-order tensor decompositions. We show that these algorithm can very efficiently compute the needed decompositions. We evaluate the fold-in algorithms experimentally on several datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms. © 2011 IEEE.},

We first map topics of user interest, represented by keywords, to a set of twitter hashtags that we use as query terms to retrieve twitter docu- ments (tweets) based on tf-idf scores, with the additional re- strictions that the documents retrieved should occur before the query timestamp. We show that this simple method per- forms significantly better than a disjunctive baseline based on the topic description.},

Tags generate folksonomies; in the current popular social tagging systems (such as delicious or Bibsonomy), they are difficult to manage, modify, and visualize in dynamic and personalized ways. The aim of this paper is to describe Folkview, an innovative way to conceive a folksonomy in terms of a multi-agent system.

In the traditional forms of storytelling, a story is told to learners in a predefined way (also known as plot). This approach is called plot-based. An alternative approach is known as character-based. The plot-based approach fails to model the dynamic behaviors of virtual characters. On the other hand, the character-based approach focuses on designing the specific behaviors or actions of the virtual characters. In this work a Storytelling Design Model is defined in order to provide pedagogy-based guidelines to the design of Storytelling Complex Learning Objects taking care of both the plot-based and character-based approaches. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, a number of algorithms have been proposed to obtain hierarchical structures - so-called folksonomies - from social tagging data. Work on these algorithms is in part driven by a belief that folksonomies are useful for tasks such as: (a) Navigating social tagging systems and (b) Acquiring semantic relationships between tags. While the promises and pitfalls of the latter have been studied to some extent, we know very little about the extent to which folksonomies are pragmatically useful for navigating social tagging systems. This paper sets out to address this gap by presenting and applying a pragmatic framework for evaluating folksonomies. We model exploratory navigation of a tagging system as decentralized search on a network of tags. Evaluation is based on the fact that the performance of a decentralized search algorithm depends on the quality of the background knowledge used. The key idea of our approach is to use hierarchical structures learned by folksonomy algorithm as background knowledge for decentralized search. Utilizing decentralized search on tag networks in combination with different folksonomies as hierarchical background knowledge allows us to evaluate navigational tasks in social tagging systems. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art folksonomy algorithms on five different social tagging datasets reveal that existing folksonomy algorithms exhibit significant, previously undiscovered, differences with regard to their utility for navigation. Our results are relevant for engineers aiming to improve navigability of social tagging systems and for scientists aiming to evaluate different folksonomy algorithms from a pragmatic perspective.

abstract={Recent research has shown the usefulness of social tags as a data source to feed resource classification. Little is known about the effect of settings on folksonomies created on social tagging systems. In this work, we consider the settings of social tagging systems to further understand tag distributions in folksonomies. We analyze in depth the tag distributions on three large-scale social tagging datasets, and analyze the effect on a resource classification task. To this end, we study the appropriateness of applying weighting schemes based on the well-known TF-IDF for resource classification. We show the great importance of settings as to altering tag distributions. Among those settings, tag suggestions produce very different folksonomies, which condition the success of the employed weighting schemes. Our findings and analyses are relevant for researchers studying tag-based resource classification, user behavior in social networks, the structure of folksonomies and tag distributions, as well as for developers of social tagging systems in search of an appropriate setting. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tagabstrcatsness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of wordabstrcatness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and Wikitaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data.},

abstract={Reading is an important skill for gaining knowledge and discovering new information in a global society. Reading competence also strongly influences a person's learning ability. However, in building better reading skills, one of the major difficulties is an absence of background knowledge to help learners read and understand material. Background knowledge helps learners make connections to construct clues within the text and determine the meaning of new vocabulary or sentences. Often, learners lack a mechanism to help them construct prior knowledge, preventing them from fully understanding their reading. To cope with these problems, this study adopts one of the most popular Web 2.0 techniques-social tagging-to help learners both read and understand English articles. We test our approach using a tag-based collaborative reading learning system. Our conclusions demonstrate the approach's effectiveness, and reveal areas for future research.},

In this paper we propose a user preferences model based on tag clustering. This model is inspired by the Data Field theory. It can depict users' different aspects of interests and dynamically generate users' preferences against different search queries. We apply this model in the data set of flickr.

abstract={Facilitated by advanced Web technologies, service mashups are currently popular for composing new value-added applications. Mashup developers might often struggle to locate the relevant and appropriate services to satisfy their dynamic and personalized requirements. This paper proposes the concept of iSocialMash, a framework that assists the rapid, on-demand and intuitive composition of service mashups, by leveraging social networks. There two key observations guiding the development of iSocialMash. On the one hand, social networks can capture both common interests and personal preferences of different users in the same or similar application contexts; they might use similar candidate services and glue them together in similar manner. On the other hand, social networks can identify potential value-added composition of mashups; different users might have complementary collaboration opportunities for newly emergent goals. iSocialMash exploits the successful experiences of social networks to provide users with useful composition recommendations (such as missing or potentially proper services as well as connections between them). Capturing such composition knowledge, the users are presented by a set of ranked recommendations from which they can choose for their personalized needs. In iSocialMash, the data model leverages the social tagging to enrich the semantics and simplify the presentation and extraction of composition knowledge. We model the composition knowledge into some mashup patterns to accommodate different social networks interactions, and generate on-the-fly recommendations according to user personal requirements. We also experimentally evaluate the efficiency of our approach and present the current status of the prototype. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Tagging refers to the metadata that many users added in the form of keywords on photos, videos, and other resources for sharing the contents via the internet. However, there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve users' or groups of users' satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users' behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve users' experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a user's needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging on online websites provides users interfaces of describing resources with their own tags, and vast user-provided image tags facilitate image retrieval and management. However, these tags are often not related to the actual image content, affecting the performance of tag related applications. In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the image tags is proposed. Firstly, information entropy of the tag is defined to refine tag frequency to predict tag initial relevance. Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Social (orfolksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies enable end-users to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as lags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. To address this issue, a variety of approaches have been proposed that recommend users what tags to use, both when labelling and when looking for resources. As we illustrate in this paper, real world folksonomies are characterized by power law distributions of tags, over which commonly used similarity metrics, including the Jaccard coefficient and the cosine similarity, fail to compute. We thus propose a novel metric, specifically developed to capture similarity in large-scale folksonomies, that is based on a mutual reinforcement principle: that is, two tags are deemed similar if they have been associated to similar resources, and vice-versa two resources are deemed similar if they have been labelled by similar tags. We offer an efficient realisation of this similarity metric, and assess its quality experimentally, by comparing it against cosine similarity, on three large-scale datasets, namely Bib-sonomy, MovieLens and CiteULike.},

abstract={Following the increased convenience and availability of personal recording devices, the number of photographs and video clips one possesses can be multiplied at an accelerated speed. As a result of owning such a huge amount of digital data, one may encounter the difficulty of locating a specific photograph or video. Reformatting of the computer system or damaging on the hard disk also cause a potential risk of losing valuable personal data. Kuo, Aoki and Yasuda proposed an experiment personal archiving and retrieving image system called PARIS (Personal Archiving and Retrieving Image System) [2]. In PARIS, A MPEG-7 based multimedia description schema with extended spatial and temporal attributes is proposed to annotate personal multimedia data. While PARIS, the proposed experiment system, is designed and implemented specially towards the trend of continuous capture and storage for personal experience; it did not manage to utilize annotations that might come from recent emerging social networking enabled services. As a continuing project of PARIS, we initiated an experiment platform with thirty smart phone users. At the first stage, which last around six months, we encourage users to capture life events with smart phone cameras and to accumulate related photographs and video clips into our experiment database. In addition, we plan to extend this experiment with another 60 participants, which equipped with personal recording devices such as consumer digital cameras or digital video cameras in the near future. In this experiment database, we encourage users to upload their media files and provide related annotations. While we provide annotation options with previous proposed MPEG-7 based multimedia description schema, the new system generates annotation suggestions semi-automatically according to various on-line photograph-hosting services. Known as social-tagging, our proposed system allows users and visitors to create tags based on our previous proposed MPEG-7 structure and utilize pre-defined spatial and temporal ontology as well as resources provided via various on-line crowd generated resources. Users are allowed to create free personal tags and utilize our system generated suggestions in order to create relevant annotations which can lead to increased retrieval precision. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.},

This is especially evident in how people talk about places in social media, where 'Los Angeles', for instance, could include areas well outside of the city or even in another county. In order to make best use of the information in social media, we need to understand what people mean when they refer to a place. Social annotations provide valuable evidence for harvesting knowledge about places, e.g., learning their boundaries and relations to other places. However, social annotations are noisy, and this can dramatically distort the learned boundaries. In this paper we propose a method that exploits the distinctive property of social annotations - that it is created by many people - to filter out noise. Using a large data set extracted from Flickr we show that our crowd-based noise filtering method can learn accurate boundaries of places, including vague places. © 2011 Authors.},

abstract={The name ambiguity problem is a challenge in many areas, especially in the field of bibliographic digital libraries. For example, in services that use citation data to compute the impact of authors, ambiguous names lead to biased measures. The problem is amplified where names are collected from heterogeneous sources, including crowdsourced annotations. This is the case in the Scholarometer system, which cross-correlates author names in user queries with those retrieved from bibliographic data. The uncontrolled nature of user-generated annotations is very valuable, but creates the need to detect ambiguous names. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect ambiguous names at query time, which makes it applicable in the context of a social computing application. We explore two kinds of heuristic features based on citations and crowdsourced topics. Our approach can detect ambiguous author names in crowdsourced scholarly data with an accuracy of 75%. © 2011 IEEE.},

The findings indicate that a number of quality criteria of image indexing are different from those of textual document indexing, such as moods, importance, generality, level of detail, and ease of use.

abstract={Recently Web 2.0 has emerged as a framework to study collaborative learning. Assessing learning in team projects is one mechanism used to improve teaching methodologies and tool support. Web 2.0 technologies enable automated assessment capabilities, leading to both rapid and incremental feedback. Such feedback can catch problems in time for pedagogic adjustment, to better guide students toward reaching learning objectives. Our courseware, SEREBRO, couples a social, tagging enabled, idea network with a range of modular toolkits, such as wikis, feeds and project management tools into a Web 2.0 environment for collaborating teams. In this paper, we first refine a set of published learning indicators into communication patterns that are facilitated in SEREBRO. We apply these indicators to student software development team discussions regarding their collaborative activities. We show how the refined patterns, captured by SEREBRO's Web 2.0 modules, are catalysts to the learning process involved in software development.},

abstract={Objective: To determine the prevalence and use of web 2.0 applications in library websites and to determine whether or not their presence enhances the quality of the sites. Design: Content analysis. Setting: Public and academic libraries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Subjects: A total of 120 academic and public library websites in English. Methods: This study identified and selected library websites from academic and public libraries using a combination of directories, ratings reports, and ranking lists from three geographic regions. Over a four-month period in 2009, three coders conducted a three-step content analysis of the selected library websites. This analysis was conducted after having established inter-coder reliability using Cohen's Kappa and analytic procedure familiarity, using a randomly selected pilot set of 30 library websites. The remaining 90 websites were evenly distributed among the three coders for analysis. They determined whether web 2.0 applications were present, examined how those applications were used, and gave an overall appraisal of website quality. Coders inspected library website links, conducted site searches, used search engines, and searched within major social networking sites to determine the presence of web 2.0 applications. A quality framework classification scheme was used during coding to identify how the web 2.0 applications were being used within library websites. This framework was established around four dimensions of library services: information acquisition (blogs and wikis), information dissemination (Rich Site Summary, or "RSS"), information organization (social tagging), and information sharing (social networking and instant messaging). A five-point Likert scale was also used in concert with a website quality evaluation framework to assess the quality of the library websites. This framework included three aspects of website quality: system quality, information quality, and service quality. A combination of statistical techniques such as Chi-square analysis, Cramer's V, analysis of variance, Tukey's statistic, and multiple regression were then used to analyze the findings. Main Results: Web 2.0 applications have been adopted by libraries across North America, Europe, and Asia. The most popular web 2.0 applications were blogs (56.6%), RSS (50%), and instant messaging services (46.6%) while less prevalent were social networking services (20%), wikis (16.6%), and social tagging applications (16.6%). The extent of libraries' adoption of web 2.0 applications also varied according to region. North American libraries used all web 2.0 applications most consistently and were more attuned to heavier users, particularly with regard to information sharing applications (e.g., instant messaging, social networking). European libraries lagged behind those in Asia in embracing information acquisition applications (e.g., blogs, wikis) but were comparable to other regions. Social networking services and instant messaging were strongly associated with region; RSS, blogs, and social tagging showed moderate to moderately strong associations; and only wikis did not demonstrate a statistically significant association with region. This study also identified how web 2.0 applications were being used. Blogs were used to generate interest, engage users, and endear users to library personnel, while wikis culled resources from users thematically. RSS feeds communicated news, events or resource updates, and were also used in combination with library blogs. Social tagging invited users to save, organize, and share information, while some websites used librarian-generated tags for search and discovery or included them as tag clouds in library blogs. Instant messaging was used to assist users synchronously during scheduled timeslots; meanwhile, social networking sites offered alternate channels to communicate and build connections with users. The authors found a relationship between website quality and the presence of web 2.0 applications based on the criteria presented in their quality evaluation framework. Applications facilitating information sharing (i.e., social networks and instant messaging) had a stronger influence on a website's overall quality than those being used for information acquisition and dissemination (i.e., RSS, wikis, and blogs). Web 2.0 applications among academic and public libraries shared a similar level of presence on the library websites; therefore, the type of library is not associated with the quality of the library website. North American websites tended to be higher in quality than European or Asian library websites, and differences in quality between European and Asian sites were insignificant. Conclusion: This study reveals that libraries in various geographic regions adopt web 2.0 applications differently. Web 2.0 applications in library websites enhance users' experience with library resources and support their interests. Library websites are implementing web 2.0 applications in a myriad of ways, including using these applications in concert with one another to increase user engagement. The presence of web 2.0 applications strongly affects service quality but only weakly influences information quality. © 2011 Bussert.},

abstract={User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) systems generate recommendations for a specific user by combining feedback (i.e. information about what is relevant for a user) provided by a set of people similar to that user. In these system the similarity among people is computed by taking into account the set of shared resources. However, there are several application domains, such as social tagging systems, where each user may have several different Topic of Interests (ToIs). In these cases, two users could share only some interests and, therefore, only a part of the feedback should be considered for producing recommendations. Focusing on social tagging systems, we propose here a novel approach to detect ToIs in the collection of the bookmarks of a user. Given a specific ToI, we adaptively identify similar people (i.e., sharing the same ToI) and select only the resources relevant to the specific ToI. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Typical tagging systems merely capture that part of the tagging interactions that enrich the semantics of tag assignments according to the system's purposes. The common practice is to build tag-based resource or user profiles on the basis of statistics about tags, disregarding the additional evidence that pertain to the resource, the user or the tag assignment itself. Thus, the main bulk of this valuable information is ignored when generating user or resource profiles. In this work, we formalize the notion of tag-based and context-based resource profiles and introduce a generic strategy for building such profiles by incorporating available context information from all parts involved in a tag assignment. Our method takes into account not only the contextual information attached to the tag, the user and the resource, but also the metadata attached to the tag assignment itself. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach on two different social tagging systems and analyze the impact of several context-based resource modeling strategies within the scope of tag recommendations. The outcomes of our study suggest a significant improvement over other methods typically employed for this task. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

The social context is described by different types of information, such as a user's personal objects, the objects of a user's social contacts, the importance of the user in the social network, etc. Both object features and the social context are first used to guide the k-nearest neighbour method for the tag recommendation. We then enhance the method by the local topology adjustment on how the nearest neighbours are selected. We learn a local transformation of the feature space surrounding a given object which pushes together objects with the same tags and puts apart objects with different tags. We show how to learn the Mahalanobis distance metric on multi-tag objects and adopt it to the tag recommendation problem. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Tagging introduces an intuitive and easy method to organize resources in information systems. Although tags exhibit useful properties for e.g. personal organization of information, recent research has shown that the navigability of social tagging systems leaves much to be desired. When browsing social tagging systems users often have to navigate through huge lists of potential results before arriving at the desired resource. Thus, from a user point of view tagging systems are typically hard to navigate. To overcome this issue, we present in this paper a novel approach to supporting navigation in social tagging systems. We introduce tag-resource taxonomies that aim to support efficient navigation of tagging systems. To that end, we introduce an algorithm for the generation of these hierarchical structures. We evaluate the proposed algorithm and hierarchies from a theoretical, semantic and empirical point of view. With these evaluations we are able to show the high performance and usefulness of the proposed hierarchies.},

This paper introduces a pair of customized operators for the network of semantic similarity among tags, i.e. NSST, constructs a network based measure to evaluate the semantic similarity among random pair of tags, and presents a case study using the empirical data retrieved from delicious website. Comparing to the traditional measures, our network based measure is capable of evaluating similarities between random tags even not co-occurred, can better reflect the structural influence of the network of tag co-occurrence, and is feasible for applications like intelligent search in user-centric Web2.0 environment. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={ExpertRec is a collaborative Web search engine, which is differ from current main search engine and allows users share search histories through a Web browser toolbar or a proxy browser. In addition, it can be taken as a novel social Web search engine and utilize expert's search histories for building recommendations. In this paper, we give an anatomy of ExpertRec and specially introduce its architecture and core techniques. It includes two basic components: a client agent and a back-end server. The former is implemented as a Mozilla Firefox toolbar (a Firefox extension), which can integrate with mainstream search engines like Google, Yahoo!, et al., to meet users' teamwork needs. And it allows users to generate high-quality tags, votes, comments over current Web including search histories, personal archival content in local host typically beyond the reach of existing Web 2.0 social tagging system. The latter is a CBR (case-based reasoning)-based recommendation engine and implemented according to some core techniques, such recommendation rules, a scalable method to identify search expertise based on a hierarchical user profile in order to improve users' search quality, and so on.

abstract={Users of social tagging systems spontaneously annotate resources providing, in this way, useful information about their interests. A collaborative filtering recommender system can use this feedback in order to identify people and resources more strictly related to a specific topic of interest. Such a collaborative filtering approach can compute similarities among tags in order to select resources associated to tags relevant for a specific interest of the user. Several research works try to infer these similarities by evaluating co-occurrences of tags over the entire set of annotated resources discarding, in this way, information about the personal classification provided by users. This paper, on the other hand, proposes an approach aimed at observing only the set of annotations of a single user in order to identify his topic of interests and to produce personalized recommendations. More specifically, following the idea that each user may have several distinct interests and people may share just some of these interests, our approach adaptively filters and combines the feedback of users according to a specific topic of interest of a user. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Recently, some have questioned the effectiveness of user-generated tags on several grounds, one of which being its lack of structure. To explore this issue, our study conducts an experiment to investigate whether user-generated tags can be enhanced with a faceted structure particularly on book tagging. Two different kinds of tagging interfaces (with and without faceted temvlate) and two differ-kinds of tagging interfaces (with and without faceted template) and two different genres of works (fiction and non-fiction) are manipulated in this experiment. According to the results of assessment, it was found that the tag sets of faceted template display more distinct tags, more number of assigned tags on average, higher degree of tag similarity, and higher convergence of tags. While the re suits suggest that the faceted interface generated tags of better quality, it also incurred more user effort. Although it is hard to make clear conclusions based on one single study, the data suggested the usefulness of a faceted template as it tends to generate tags with higher viewpoint exhaustivity as well as consensus. Nevertheless, the actual retrieval effectiveness of the combination of tagging and faceted structure still has to be examined and assessed in further empirical research.},

abstract={Folksonomies have become a powerful tool to describe, discover, search, and navigate online resources (e.g., pictures, videos, blogs) on the Social Web. Unlike taxonomies and ontologies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users, by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe a piece of information. However, the freedom afforded to users comes at a cost: as tags are informally defined and ungoverned, the retrieval of information becomes more challenging. In this paper, we propose Clustered Social Ranking (CSR), a novel search and recommendation technique specifically developed to support new users of Web 2.0 websites finding content of interest. The observation underpinning CSR is that the vast majority of content on Web 2.0 websites is created by a small proportion of users (leaders), while the others (followers) mainly browse such content. CSR first identifies who the leaders are; it then clusters them into communities with shared interests, based on their tagging activity. Users' queries (be them searches or recommendations) are then directed to the community of leaders who can best answer them. Our evaluation, conducted on the CiteULike dataset, demonstrates that CSR achieves an accuracy that is comparable to the best state-of-the-art techniques, but at a much smaller computational cost, thus affording it better scalability in these fast growing settings. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Moreover, previous research has demonstrated that the use of social tagging technologies allows teachers to empower learners and create exciting new learning opportunities. However, in building a teaching support system, one of the major difficulties is the lack of a mechanism to assist teachers in monitoring running activities and student progress, such that constructive suggestions can be given to the students, and tutoring strategies can be improved accordingly.

abstract={Social tagging is an increasingly popular way to describe latent semantic information of web resources and thus is widely used to improve the performance of information retrieval system. However, there also has been significant variance of the quality of social tags because they can be annotated by folks on the web freely. As a consequence, how to measure the quality of social tags (referred to as social tag confidence) becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose a statistic model to measure the confidence of social tags by utilizing a combination of three attributes of a social tag: web resource, tag, and tagging user. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our model, two experiments are performed with datasets crawled from del.icio.us. Experimental results show that our model has a better performance than other approaches with respect to Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (NDCG). In addition, F-1 measure of tagged web page clustering performance is also increased when our model is applied to filter the noisy social tags with low tag confidence. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Social tagging also facilitates sharing of Web resources. This study reviews the chronological variation of social tagging data and tracks social trends by clustering tag time series. The data corpus in this study is collected from Hemidemi.com. A tag is represented in a time series form according to its annotating Web pages. Then time series clustering is applied to group tag time series with similar patterns and trends in the same time period. Finally, the similarities between clusters in different time periods are calculated to determine which clusters have similar themes, and the trend variation of a specific tag in different time periods is also analyzed. The evaluation shows the recommendation accuracy of the proposed approach is about 75%.

abstract={The association of a high-level semantics to the geometric components of 3D worlds for the net is gaining popularity, because it enables advanced uses of the 3D objects and it may improve their findability, extended to a network of annotated 3D worlds. Most of the proposals for annotating 3D worlds for the net are characterized by top-down approaches, where selected authors annotate 3D worlds in relation to predefined classes and relations. A different approach - introduced only in recent times for the 3D web but widely diffused in the hypertextual web - permits to users to annotate freely objects and spaces, originating bottom-up structures defined as folksonomies. This work introduces a web-based specification, a software architecture and a set of interfaces for annotating 3D worlds. The proposal is based on the X3D standard and enables both top-down and bottom-up annotation styles. The components of the software architecture - named ToBoA-3D - can be used in different scenarios, ranging from the complete management of a centralized set of annotated 3D worlds to the creation of a network of top-down annotated 3D worlds distributed on the net. Besides, the solution proposed can be applied to many X3D worlds already available on the net, without compromising the interaction possibilities implemented by the world designers. The architecture includes a search module that may use the annotations retrieved during the browsing phase for triggering the research of other objects and spaces that share the same labels but are part of other 3D worlds. The integration of navigation and searching - introduced in ToBoA-3D but unavailable for most of the 3D worlds for the net - represents an additional feature that may improve furthermore the findability of the resources. The paper defines also an enhanced model for defining the spatial limits of complex spaces, that is used as a basis for annotating these entities. The presentation of the user interfaces, applied to an example related to the architectural domain, concludes the work. © 2011 ACM.},

In this paper, we investigate how to enhance Web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method called Tripartite Clustering which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation- based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, people can annotate arbitrary tags to online data to categorize and index them. However, the lack of the "a priori" set of words makes it difficult for people to reach consensus about the semantics of tags and how to categorize data. Ontologies based approaches can help reaching such consensus, but they are still facing problems such as inability of model ambiguous and new concepts properly. For tags that are used very few times, since they can only be used in very specific contexts, their semantics are very clear and detailed. Although people have no consensus on these tags, it is still possible to leverage these detailed semantics to model the other tags. In this paper we introduce a random walk and spreading activation like model to represent the semantics of tags using semantics of unpopular tags. By comparing the proposed model to the classic Latent Semantic Analysis approach in a concept clustering task, we show that the proposed model can properly capture the semantics of tags. ©2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

abstract={The presence of social networks in complex systems has made networks and community structure a focal point of study in many domains. Previous studies have focused on the structural emergence and growth of communities and on the topics displayed within the network. However, few scholars have closely examined the relationship between the thematic and structural properties of networks. Therefore, this article proposes the Tagger Tag Resource-Latent Dirichlet Allocation-Community model (TTR-LDA-Community model), which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm through an inference mechanism. Using social tagging data from Delicious, this article demonstrates the clustering of active taggers into communities, the topic distributions within communities, and the ranking of taggers, tags, and resources within these communities. The data analysis evaluates patterns in community structure and topical affiliations diachronically. The article evaluates the effectiveness of community detection and the inference mechanism embedded in the model and finds that the TTR-LDA-Community model outperforms other traditional models in tag prediction. This has implications for scholars in domains interested in community detection, profiling, and recommender systems. © 2011 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Social tags have become an important tool for improving access to online resources, particularly non-text media. With the dramatic growth of user-generated content, the importance of tags is likely to grow. However, while tagging behavior is well studied, the relationship between tagging behavior and features of the media being tagged is not well understood. In this paper, we examine the relationship between tagging behavior and image type. Through a lab-based study with 51 subjects and an analysis of an online dataset of image tags, we show that there are significant differences in the number, order, and type of tags that users assign based on their past experience with an image, the type of image being tagged, and other image features. We present these results and discuss the significant implications this work has for tag-based search algorithms, tag recommendation systems, and other interface issues. © 2011 ASIS&T.},

abstract={In the past decade, Social Tagging Systems have attracted increasing attention from both physical and computer science communities. Besides the underlying structure and dynamics of tagging systems, many efforts have been addressed to unify tagging information to reveal user behaviors and preferences, extract the latent semantic relations among items, make recommendations, and so on. Specifically, this article summarizes recent progress about tag-aware recommender systems, emphasizing on the contributions from three mainstream perspectives and approaches: network-based methods, tensor-based methods, and the topic-based methods.

abstract={In social tagging systems such as Delicious and Flickr, users collaboratively manage tags to annotate resources. Naturally, a social tagging system can be modeled as a (user, tag, resource) hypernetwork, where there are three different types of nodes, namely users, resources and tags, and each hyperedge has three end nodes, connecting a user, a resource and a tag that the user employs to annotate the resource. Then how can we automatically cluster related users, resources and tags, respectively? This is a problem of community detection in a 3-partite, 3-uniform hypernetwork. More generally, given a K-partite K-uniform (hyper)network, where each (hyper)edge is a K-tuple composed of nodes of K different types, how can we automatically detect communities for nodes of different types? In this paper, by turning this problem into a problem of finding an efficient compression of the (hyper)network's structure, we propose a quality function for measuring the goodness of partitions of a K-partite K-uniform (hyper)network into communities, and develop a fast community detection method based on optimization. Our method overcomes the limitations of state of the art techniques and has several desired properties such as comprehensive, parameter-free, and scalable. We compare our method with existing methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets. ©2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

abstract={Many organizational innovations can be explained by the movement of ideas and information from one social context to another, "from where they are known to where they are not" (Hargadon 2002, p. 41). A relatively new technology, social bookmarking, is increasingly being used in many organizations (McAfee 2006), and may enhance employee innovativeness by providing a new, socially mediated channel for discovering information. Users of such systems create publicly viewable lists of bookmarks (each being a hyperlink to an information resource) and often assign searchable keywords ("tags") to these bookmarks. We explore two different perspectives on how accessing others' bookmarks could enhance how innovative an individual is at work. First, we develop two hypotheses around the idea that quantity may be a proxy for diversity, following a well established literature that holds that the more information obtained and the larger the number of sources consulted, the higher the likelihood an individual will come across novel ideas. Next, we offer two hypotheses adapted from social network research that argue that the shape of the network of connections that is created when individuals access each others' bookmarks can reflect information novelty, and that individuals whose networks bridge more structural holes and have greater effective reach are likely to be more innovative. An analysis of bookmarking system use in a global professional services firm provides strong support for the social diversity of information sources as a predictor of employee innovativeness, but no support that the number of bookmarks accessed matters. By extending the social networks literature to theorize the functionalities offered by social bookmarking systems, this research establishes structural holes theory as a valuable lens through which social technologies may be understood.},

abstract={As a new and emerging problem space, engineering education research continues to define its core content, methods, and theory. However, the field of engineering education research has not fully utilized or innovated new methods that leverage more modern web 2.0 techniques to understand systemic trends within the problem space. In this paper, we introduce a new technique called weighted social tagging as a research methodology. As opposed to simple frequency counts to generate word clouds, weighted social tagging allows users to assign relative weights and corresponding confidence ratings to each of the tags. We demonstrate the application of weighted social tagging on a small-scale dataset of papers from the Journal of Engineering Education (JEE) that extend over a period of 5 years from 2005 to 2009-a total of 152 papers. We attempt to address the following questions: (1) How effective is weighted social tagging compared to frequency counting in identifying trends and core concepts? (2) What trends and core topics in JEE from 2005 to 2009 can be identified through weighted social tagging method? (3) How do they vary qualitatively from the trends identified by just counting word frequencies (e.g. Wordle)? Using techniques found in the field of data mining and visual analytics, we show how the weighted social tagging method can be combined with graph-based visualization techniques to gain a deeper understanding of engineering education research literature. The power of this technique lies in its ability to quickly leverage the collective intelligence of a community of researchers. Clearly, just one reader's tags will be insufficient to derive the full context and meaning of a paper. However, when we engage a large community of researchers, the tags as a collection render a significant portion of the meaning of a dataset. When this dataset is placed on a timeline, trends of concepts, methodologies, and findings begin to emerge. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.},

abstract={Social tagging is an increasingly popular way to describe and classify documents on the web. However, the quality of the tags varies considerably since the tags are authored freely. How to rate the tags becomes an important issue. Most social tagging systems order tags just according to the input sequence with little information about the importance and relevance. This limits the applications of tags such as information search, tag recommendation, and so on. In this paper, we pay attention to finding the authority score of tags in the whole tag space conditional on topics and put forward a topic-sensitive tag ranking (TSTR) approach to rank tags automatically according to their topic relevance. We first extract topics from folksonomy using a probabilistic model, and then construct a transition probability graph. Finally, we perform random walk over the topic level on the graph to get topic rank scores of tags. Experimental results show that the proposed tag ranking method is both effective and efficient. We also apply tag ranking into tag recommendation, which demonstrates that the proposed tag ranking approach really boosts the performances of social-tagging related applications. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Drawing our dataset from a popular social tagging system, Delicious, we conducted six text categorization experiments using the top 100 frequently occurring tags. We also conducted a human evaluation experiment to manually evaluate the relevance of some 2000 documents related to these tags. The results from the text categorization experiments suggest that not all tags are useful for content discovery regardless of the tag weighting schemes. Moreover, there were cases where the evaluators did not perform as well as the classifiers, especially when there was a lack of cues in the documents for them to ascertain the relationship with the tag assigned. This paper discusses three implications arising from the findings and suggests a number of directions for further research. © The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract={Context-aware music recommender systems are capable to suggest music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user mood or location, that may influence the user preferences at a particular moment. In this paper we consider a particular kind of context aware recommendation task - selecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags attached by a users' population to both music and POIs. Moreover, we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not. The results of the experiment show that there is a strong overlap between the users' selections and the best matching music that is recommended by the system for a POI. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Biologically inspired design is an important emerging movement in engineering design. Finding relevant biological sources of inspiration from existing biology literature is one of the important challenges of this activity. We conjecture that annotating biology articles with lightweight Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) models is one way to address this challenge. We present Biologue, a social citation cataloging system that allows its users to gather, organize, share, and most importantly, annotate scholarly articles with SBF models. This feature not only allows the implementation of search mechanism that is more targeted to the needs of designers seeking bio-inspiration, but also helps designers make sense of the articles returned by the search mechanism. © 2011 Authors.},

In this paper, we provide further evidence for this observation by demonstrating that tagging data obtained from certain types of users - so-called Categorizers - outperforms data from other users on a social classification task. We show that segmenting users based on their tagging behavior has significant impact on the performance of automated classification of tagged data by using (i) tagging data from two different social tagging systems, (ii) a Support Vector Machine as a classification mechanism and (iii) existing classification systems such as the Library of Congress Classification System as ground truth.

abstract={Social tagging is one of the hallmarks of Web2.0. The most common role of tags is descriptive. However, tags are being used for other purposes such as to indicate some actions to be conducted on the resource (e.g. "toread"). This work focuses on "prescriptive tags" that have associated some implicit behaviour in the user's mind. So far, little support is given for the automation of this "implicit behaviour", more to the point, if this behaviour is outside the tagging site. This paper introduces the notion of "reactive tags" as a means for tagging to impact sites other than the tagging site itself. The operational semantics of reactive tags is defined through event-condition-action rules. Events are the action of tagging. Conditions check for additional data. Finally, rule's actions might impact someone else's account in a different website. The specification of this behaviour semantics is hidden through a graphical interface that permits users with no programming background to easily associate "reactions" to the act of tagging. A working system, TABASCO, is presented as proof of concept. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tag abstractness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of word abstractness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and WikiTaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

By leveraging social tagging, we propose a new personalized search method to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. Our approach first determines the similarities between resources and between tags. Thereafter, we build two models: a user-tag relation model that reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and a tag-item relation model that captures how a certain tag has been tagged to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly map the tags on the items depending on a particular user's query in order to find the most attractive media content relevant to the user needs.

Social tagging is embedded into the space spanned by current structuring approaches like taxonomies, meta-data, and ontologies in order to identify its semantic and pragmatic foundations. Thereby, we use the Inclusive Universal Access paradigm to assess social tagging with respect to socio-technical criteria for inclusive and barrier-free provision and usage of web services. As a result of this analysis we propose a concept we chose to call "Inclusive Social Tagging". We subsequently use the requirements set forth by this concept to assess the tagging functionality of currently popular Web 2.0 services. We found that these services differ significantly in their implementation of tagging functionality, and we did not discover any service providing full compliance with Inclusive Social Tagging requirements. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The World Wide Web, the world's largest resource for information, has evolved from organizing information using controlled, top-down taxonomies to a bottom up approach that emphasizes assigning meaning to data via mechanisms such as the Social Web (Web 2.0).

We propose a multi-phase approach that exploits user-defined tags to identify and extract domain-level concepts. We operationalize this approach and assess its feasibility by application to a publicly available tag repository.

abstract={With the popularity of social media services, the sheer amount of content is increasing exponentially on the Social Web that leads to attract considerable attention to recommender systems. Recommender systems provide users with recommendations of items suited to their needs. To provide proper recommendations to users, recommender systems require an accurate user model that can reflect a user's characteristics, preferences and needs. In this study, by leveraging user-generated tags as preference indicators, we propose a new collaborative approach to user modeling that can be exploited to recommender systems. Our approach first discovers relevant and irrelevant topics for users, and then enriches an individual user model with collaboration from other similar users. In order to evaluate the performance of our model, we compare experimental results with a user model based on collaborative filtering approaches and a vector space model. The experimental results have shown the proposed model provides a better representation in user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of accuracy and ranking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, owing to the size and dynamic nature of the information resources, the end user must sift through a large amount of retrieved information in order to find the desired information. To alleviate this difficulty, we present a novel approach for mapping users to the relevant information, by constructing specialized domains in which the users have demonstrated interest. We use reinforcement learning and social tagging in the approach to assist end users to select the concept domains most relevant to their needs. Our approach involves enriching the user's query with related linguistic ontologies and statistical semantic-related concept terms. We employ the Natural Language Process (NLP) techniques to enrich the user's query with semantic, lexical, synonymous terms, and probabilistic topic models, such as Latent Dirichet Allocation (LDA), to extract highly ranked topics from a query's retrieved information.},

An analysis of 45 interviews with heavy Web users reveals that user perceptions of tags differ from common assumptions held by researchers and designers of social tagging systems. Among beliefs held by participants were that tags were query suggestions or links to other pages, sites, or advertisements - although most identified tags as categories or keywords - and that tags were generated automatically by the computer system. Several participants believed that tags were intended for not only other users but also systems such as search engines. Our findings indicate that Web users, including those who are taggers themselves, experience a high level of uncertainty and confusion about the nature, purpose and value of tags.

abstract={Individuals often imitate each other to fall into the typical group, leading to a self-organized state of typical behaviors in a community. In this paper, we model self-organization in social tagging systems and illustrate the underlying interaction and dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a model in which individuals adjust their own tagging tendency to imitate the average tagging tendency. We found that when users are of low confidence, they tend to imitate others and lead to a self-organized state with active tagging. On the other hand, when users are of high confidence and are stubborn to change, tagging becomes inactive. We observe a phase transition at a critical level of user confidence when the system changes from one regime to the other. The distributions of post length obtained from the model are compared to real data, which show good agreement. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={In a social tagging system, resources (such as photos, video and web pages) are associated with tags. These tags allow the resources to be effectively searched through tag-based keyword matching using traditional IR techniques. We note that in many such systems, tags of a resource are often assigned by a diverse audience of causal users (taggers). This leads to two issues that gravely affect the effectiveness of resource retrieval: (1) Noise: tags are picked from an uncontrolled vocabulary and are assigned by untrained taggers. The tags are thus noisy features in resource retrieval. (2) A multitude of aspects: different taggers focus on different aspects of a resource. Representing a resource using a flattened bag of tags ignores this important diversity of taggers. To improve the effectiveness of resource retrieval in social tagging systems, we propose CubeLSI a technique that extends traditional LSI to include taggers as another dimension of feature space of resources. We compare CubeLSI against a number of other tag-based retrieval models and show that CubeLSI significantly outperforms the other models in terms of retrieval accuracy. We also prove two interesting theorems that allow CubeLSI to be very efficiently computed despite the much enlarged feature space it employs. © 2011 IEEE.},

This implies that in the social tagging system, the newly tagged items by the user are more relevant than older items. This study proposes a novel recommender system that considers the users' recent tag preferences. The proposed system includes the following stages: grouping similar users into clusters using an E-M clustering algorithm, finding similar resources based on the user's bookmarks, and recommending the top-N items to the target user. The study examines the system's information retrieval performance using a dataset from del.icio.us, which is a famous social bookmarking web site. Experimental results show that the proposed system is better and more effective than traditional approaches.},

With more subject terms brought into information systems via social tagging, manual cataloging, or automated indexing, many more partially relevant results can be retrieved. Using examples from digital image collections and online library catalog systems, we explore the problem and advocate for adding a weighting mechanism to subject indexing and tagging to make web search and navigation more effective and efficient. We argue that the zveighting of subject terms is more important than ever in today's world of growing collections, more federated searching, and expansion of social tagging. Such a weighting mechanism needs to be considered and applied not only by indexers, catalogers, and taggers, but also needs to be incorporated into system functionality and metadata schemas.},

In this paper, we introduce a random walk-based method to measure relevance between tags by exploiting the relationship between tags and resources. Based on this, we also develop a novel clustering method, TagClus, which can address several challenges in tag clustering.

abstract={Recently, social tagging has become increasingly prevalent on the Internet, which provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems offer lots of useful information, such as tag, an expression of user's preference towards a certain resource; time, a denotation of user's interests drift. As information explosion, it is necessary to recommend resources that a user might like. Since collaborative filtering (CF) is aimed to provide personalized services, how to integrate tag and time information in CF to provide better personalized recommendations for social tagging systems becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate the importance and usefulness of tag and time information when predicting users' preference and examine how to exploit such information to build an effective resource-recommendation model. We design a recommender system to realize our computational approach. Also, we show empirically using data from a real-world dataset that tag and time information can well express users' taste and we also show that better performances can be achieved if such information is integrated into CF. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={With the emergence of social tagging systems and the possibility for users to extensively annotate web resources and any content enormous amounts of unordered information and user generated metadata circulate the Web. Accordingly a viable visualisation form needs to integrate this unclassified content into meaningful visual representations. We argue that tag clouds can make the grade. We assume that the application of clustering techniques for arranging tags can be a useful method to generate meaningful units within a tag cloud. We think that clustered tag clouds can potentially help to enhance user performance. In this paper we present a description of tag clouds including a theoretical discourse on the strengths and weaknesses of using them in common Web-based contexts. Further recent methods of semantic clustering for visualizing tag clouds are reviewed. Findings from user studies that investigated the visual perception of differently arranged depictions of tags follow. The main objective consists in the exploration of characteristical aspects in perceptual phenomenons and cognitive processes during the interaction with a tag cloud. This clears the way for useful implications on the constitution and design factors of that visualisation form. Finally a new approach is proposed in order to further develop on this concept. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper aims to examine whether users' watching networks can improve collaborative filtering-based recommendations (CF). Watching networks are established by users upon their perceived usefulness or interests about other users' information collections. The networks do not require mutual agreement between a watching party and a watched party. The typical example of this network is'following' in Twitter,'watching' on CiteULike, or'contacts' on Flickr. Once a user declares that'I want to watch user A', the user A's information collection is displayed to the watching user, continuously. It can beinterpreted to mean that a watching user found some shared interests in user A's collection and want to refer to it in future. The approaches explored in this paper take advantage of this watching network as a part of user's preferences for recommendations. To evaluate the potential of these approaches, we focus on a social tagging system, CiteULike. Our data shows that in this context, a hybrid recommendation approachthat fusesCF and watching network-based recommendations outperforms both CF and network-based recommendations.

The tags created by users in social tagging system not only contain rich semantic information about the described web objects, but also provide a window for information providers to learn a user's information interests and preferences.

abstract={Social tagging systems have recently become very popular as a method of categorising information online and have been used to annotate a wide range of different resources. In such systems users are free to choose whatever keywords or "tags" they wish to annotate each resource, resulting in a highly personalised, unrestricted vocabulary. While this freedom of choice has several notable advantages, it does come at the cost of making searching of these systems more difficult as the vocabulary problem introduced is more pronounced than in a normal information retrieval setting. In this paper we propose to use hidden topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall. We first describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a simple topic model and then introduce 2 extended models which can be used to personalise the results by including information about the user who made each annotation. We test these 3 models and compare them with 3 non-topic model baselines on a large data sample obtained from the Delicious social bookmarking site. Our evaluations show that our methods significantly outperform all of the baselines with the personalised models also improving significantly upon unpersonalised LDA. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The problem of efficiently managing massive datasets has gained increasing attention due to the availability of a plethora of data from various sources, such as the Web. Moreover, Web 2.0 applications seem to be one of the most fruitful sources of information as they have attracted the interest of a large number of users that are eager to contribute to the creation of new data, available online. Several Web 2.0 applications incorporate Social Tagging features, allowing users to upload and tag sets of online resources. This activity produces massive amounts of data on a daily basis, which can be represented by a tripartite graph structure that connects users, resources and tags. The analysis of Social Tagging Systems (STS) emerges as a promising research field, enabling the identification of common patterns in the behavior of users, or the identification of communities of semantically related tags and resources, and much more. The massive size of STS datasets dictates the necessity for a robust underlying infrastructure to be used for their storage and access. This chapter contains a survey of existing solutions to the problem of storing and managing massive graph data focusing particularly on the implications that the underlying technologies of such frameworks have on the support/operation of Web 2.0 applications using them as back-end storage solutions, as well as on the efficient execution of web mining tasks. Considering the category of STS as an example of Web 2.0 applications, the requirements that are posed for the management of STS data are thoroughly discussed. On the basis of these requirements three frameworks have been developed, using state-of-the-art technologies as backbones. The results of benchmarks conducted on the developed frameworks are presented and discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Teaching the machine has been a great challenge for computer vision scientists since the very first steps of artificial intelligence. Throughout the decades there have been remarkable achievements that drastically enhanced the capabilities of the machines both from the perspective of infrastructure (i.e., computer networks, processing power, storage capabilities), as well as from the perspective of processing and understanding of the data. Nevertheless, computer vision scientists are still confronted with the problem of designing techniques and frameworks that will be able to facilitate effortless learning and allow analysis methods to easily scale in many different domains and disciplines. It is true that state of the art approaches cannot produce highly effective models, unless there is dedicated, and thus costly, human supervision in the process of learning that dictates the relation between the content and its meaning (i.e., annotation). Recently, we have been witnessing the rapid growth of Social Media that emerged as the result of users' willingness to communicate, socialize, collaborate and share content. The outcome of this massive activity was the generation of a tremendous volume of user contributed data that have been made available on the Web, usually along with an indication of their meaning (i.e., tags). This has motivated the research objective of investigating whether the Collective Intelligence that emerges from the users' contributions inside a Web 2.0 application, can be used to remove the need for dedicated human supervision during the process of learning. In this chapter we deal with a very demanding learning problem in computer vision that consists of detecting and localizing an object within the image content. We present a method that exploits the Collective Intelligence that is fostered inside an image Social Tagging System in order to facilitate the automatic generation of training data and therefore object detection models. The experimental results shows that although there are still many issues to be addressed, computer vision technology can definitely benefit from Social Media. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={With the emergence of Web 2.0, social tagging systems become highly popular in recent years and thus form the so-called folksonomies. Personalized tag recommendation in social tagging systems is to provide a user with a ranked list of tags for a specific resource that best serves the user's needs. Many existing tag recommendation approaches assume that users are independent and identically distributed. This assumption ignores the social relations between users, which are increasingly popular nowadays. In this paper, we investigate the role of social relations in the task of tag recommendation and propose a personalized collaborative filtering algorithm. In addition to the social annotations made by collaborative users, we inject the social relations between users and the content similarities between resources into a graph representation of folksonomies. To fully explore the structure of this graph, instead of computing similarities between objects using feature vectors, we exploit the method of random-walk computation of similarities, which furthermore enable us to model a user's tag preferences with the similarities between the user and all the tags. We combine both the collaborative information and the tag preferences to recommend personalized tags to users. We conduct experiments on a dataset collected from a real-world system. The results of comparative experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art tag recommendation algorithms in terms of prediction quality measured by precision, recall and NDCG. © 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, users have different purposes when they annotate items. Tags not only depict the content of the annotated items, for example by listing the objects that appear in a photo, or express contextual information about the items, for example by providing the location or the time in which a photo was taken, but also describe subjective qualities and opinions about the items, or can be related to organisational aspects, such as self-references and personal tasks. Current folksonomy-based search and recommendation models exploit the social tag space as a whole to retrieve those items relevant to a tag-based query or user profile, and do not take into consideration the purposes of tags. We hypothesise that a significant percentage of tags are noisy for content retrieval, and believe that the distinction of the personal intentions underlying the tags may be beneficial to improve the accuracy of search and recommendation processes. We present a mechanism to automatically filter and classify raw tags in a set of purpose-oriented categories. Our approach finds the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. The obtained concepts are then transformed into semantic classes that can be uniquely assigned to content- and context-based categories. The identification of subjective and organisational tags is based on natural language processing heuristics. We collected a representative dataset from Flickr social tagging system, and conducted an empirical study to categorise real tagging data, and evaluate whether the resultant tags categories really benefit a recommendation model using the Random Walk with Restarts method. The results show that content- and context-based tags are considered superior to subjective and organisational tags, achieving equivalent performance to using the whole tag space. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of social search as a new concept, drawing upon the patterns of web search behaviour. It aims to: define social search; present a taxonomy of social search; and propose a user-centred social search method. A mixed method approach was adopted to investigate and conceptualise the notion of social search. A review of literature on social search was carried out to identify the key trends and topics. A model of online collaboration was adopted to delineate the types and categories of social search. Four use case scenarios were developed to provide a more pragmatic approach to the understanding of social search. The developed taxonomy of social search reveals important similarities and differences between many social search systems. This analysis reveals a gap in social search approaches. A practical method was identified that allows users to directly leverage social search without special features built into search engines. For feasibility reasons, Google was used as an example of a search system that can be used for carrying out social searches. The paper provides several practical implications for web searchers as well as web designers. In particular, some recommendations are provided for the design of search engines, digital libraries and browser add-ons. The study demonstrates the value and power of “collective intelligence” in web search. It shows how general web searches can be enhanced through using socially enhanced web-based tools such as social bookmarking systems, social tagging services and social media sites. This is the first study that provides a granular analysis of the notion of social search and puts forward a taxonomy of social search. The use cases developed and reported are created based on real search topics, and show the value and validity of the approach taken. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Free-tagging is one of the leading mechanisms characterizing the so-called web 2.0, enabling users to define collaboratively the meaning of web data for improving their findability. Tagging is applied in several forms to hypermedia data, that represent the largest part of the information on the web. In spite of that, there is a growing part of web data made of 3D vectors representing real objects such as trees, houses and people that lacks any semantic definition. Such situation prevents any advanced use of the data contained inside these 3D worlds, including seeking, filtering and manipulation of the objects represented by vectors. This work proposes a bottom-up approach for adding semantics to such data, based on the collaborative effort of users navigating the web. This paper, after describing the similarities and the differences that characterize tagging for hypermedia and interactive 3D worlds, discusses the design choices that have guided the definition of a specification for associating tags to 3D objects. The proposed specification is based on X3D the ISO standard for describing 3D interactive worlds for the net and permits to tag a large part of the existing 3D worlds compliant with this standard. A client-software web architecture for tagging and navigating 3D worlds compliant with the specification presented is illustrated. Finally, a web-based user interface for tagging and browsing the result of the cooperative activity of users is presented and applied to a complex 3D world related to the cultural heritage domain. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Additionally, TagMe! automatically maps tags and categories to DBpedia URIs to clearly define the meaning. In this work we discuss the differences between tags and categories and show how both facets can be applied to learn semantic relations between concepts referenced by tags and categories. We also expose the benefits of the visual (spatial) context of the tag assignments, with respect to ranking algorithms for search and retrieval of relevant items. We do so by analyzing metrics of size and position of the annotated areas. Finally, in our experiments we compare different strategies to realize semantic mappings and show that already lightweight approaches map tags and categories with high precisions (86.85% and 93.77% respectively).

abstract={Under social tagging systems, a typical Web2.0 application, users label digital data sources by using tags which are freely chosen textual descriptions. Tags are used to index, annotate and retrieve resource as an additional metadata of resource. Poor retrieval performance remains a major problem of most social tagging systems resulting from the severe difficulty of ambiguity, redundancy and less semantic nature of tags. Clustering method is a useful tool to increase the ability of information retrieval in the aforementioned systems. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm named LIPC (Local Information Passing Clustering algorithm). The main steps of LIPC are: (1) we estimate a KNN neighbor directed graph G of tags and calculate the kernel density of each tag in its neighborhood; (2) we generate local information, local coverage and local kernel of each tag; (3) we pass the local information on G by I and O operators until they are converged and tag priory are generated; (4) we use tag priory to find out the clusters of tags. Experimental results on two real world datasets namely MedWorm and MovieLens demonstrate the efficiency and the superiority of the proposed method. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={On many modern Web platforms users can annotate the available online resources with freely-chosen tags. This Social Tagging data can then be used for information organization or retrieval purposes. Tag recommenders in that context are designed to help the online user in the tagging process and suggest appropriate tags for resources with the purpose to increase the tagging quality. In recent years, different algorithms have been proposed to generate tag recommendations given the ternary relationships between users, resources, and tags. Many of these algorithms however suffer from scalability and performance problems, including the popular FolkRank algorithm. In this work, we propose a neighborhood-based tag recommendation algorithm called LocalRank, which in contrast to previous graph-based algorithms only considers a small part of the user-resource-tag graph. An analysis of the algorithm on a popular social bookmarking data set reveals that the recommendation accuracy is on a par with or slightly better than FolkRank while at the same time recommendations can be generated instantaneously using a compact in-memory representation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Our objective is to enrich the profiles of folksonomy users with pertinent resources. We argue that the automatic sharing of resources strengthens social links among actors and we exploit this idea to enrich user profiles by increasing the weights associated to web resources according to social relations. We base upon association rules which are a powerful method for discovering interesting relationships among a large set of data on the web. We extract association rules from folksonomies and use them to recommend supplementary resources associated to the tags involved in these rules. In this recommendation process, we reduce tag ambiguity by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies.},

abstract={The unfolding of Web 2.0 brought an increasing number of blogs. Accompanying this growth, social tagging became an important mechanism to assist users on blog searches, allowing people to generate tags for blog posts. However, social tagging also has its problems. Different keywords can share the same semantic meaning (synonyms). The same keyword can have multiple meanings (polysemy), and the keywords can be too specific or too general. In order to address these issues, this paper implements and evaluates four tag recommendation services. The main contribution of this work is to tackle these problems using different approaches; enabling users to choose the appropriate recommendation service according to their needs. Furthermore, some preliminary experiments were performed and the effectiveness of the services is presented.},

abstract={Affective computing is receiving increasing attention in many sectors, ranging from advertisement to politics. This work, set in a Social Semantic Web framework, presents ArsEmotica, an application software for associating the predominant emotions to artistic resources of a social tagging platform. Our aim is to extract a rich emotional semantics (i.e. not limited to a positive or a negative reception) of tagged resources through an ontology driven approach. This is done by exploiting and combining available computational and sentiment lexicons with an ontology of emotional categories. The information sources we rely upon are the tags by which users annotated resources, that are available through the ArsMeteo platform, and the ontology OntoEmotion, that was enriched by means of our tool with over four hundred Italian emotional words referring to the about eighty-five emotional concepts of the ontology. Tags directly referring to ontological concepts are identified, while potentially affective tags, can be annotated by using the ontology thanks to the spontaneous intervention of the user, in a pure Web 2.0 approach. Finally, the tagged artworks are related with the emerging predominant emotions.},

In this paper, we present a study of top-k search in social tagging sites by utilizing multiple social networks and temporal information. In particular, besides the global connection, we consider two main social networks, namely the friendship and the common interest networks in our scoring functions. Based on the degree of participation in various networks, users can be categorized into specific classes that differ in their weights on each scoring component. Temporal information, usually ignored by previous works, can enhance the popularity and freshness of the ranking results. Experiments and evaluations on real social tagging datasets show that our framework works well in practice and give useful and intuitive results. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

We propose a model that allows tagging as well as establishing relations between any pair of resources, not just objects and tags. Moreover, we propose to use this extension to enrich and facilitate the process of building semantic knowledge representations. We (1) provide a formal description for our approach, (2) introduce an architecture to facilitate semantic knowledge derivation, and (3) present a preliminary experiment. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of social tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and evaluated two enhancements of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike, a social tagging service for scientific articles. The result obtained after two phases of evaluation suggests that both enhancements are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms, as we do in our NwCF approach, leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 similarity measure, an alternative to Pearson correlation for calculating the similarity between users and their neighbors, increases the coverage of the recommendation process. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Ontologies have been an important role of supporting efficient interoperability among information systems in distributed environment. In this paper, we propose a query transformation method to efficiently collect as many relevant resources from the distributed information systems as possible. More importantly, the query from the source peer can be decomposed and propagated as maintaining the original contexts. Through the experiments, we have shown that query-activated concept (QAC)-based schemes have fulfilled an efficient query decomposition process. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recently, social tagging systems have been widely applied in web systems and some physical properties have been found applications in efficiently and effectively personalized recommendation. Social tags can provide highly abstract information about not only item contents but also personalized preferences, hence they might help generate better personalized recommendations. However, how to find out the relevant yet diverse items that are not associated with any tag remains an open question for us. In this paper, we assume a basic attraction may exist for each item. Moreover, considering both personal and global vocabulary, as well as such attractor, we apply diffusion-based recommendation algorithm in weighted social tagging networks. We then evaluate it in a real-world data set Del.icio.us. Experimental results demonstrate that the usage of both tag information and attractor can significantly improve diversity of personalized recommendations, and thus it can be regarded as an alternative recommendation method. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Social Tagging as a decentralized collaborative and collective approach to describe, structure, and share digital objects with user created keywords has become increasingly popular since 2004. Once evolved from a social bookmarking application service, meanwhile it is used for several private and corporate purposes. It is also applicable for e-HRM tasks, e.g. augmenting employees' profiles and competency models with tags. In this paper we pursue to detect its applicability to support competency acquisition. In detail we firstly answer the question, which characteristics social tagging systems offer to gather competency related information in order to describe competency profiles. To answer this question we present a conceptual framework that focuses on social tagging systems from an external and internal view. Secondly, we analyze if social tagging systems are able to ensure the provisioning of reliable and valid competency related information from the classical testing theories point of view. It has been detected, that both the ambiguity of language and the absence of rules aggravate the estimation of reliability and validity. Nevertheless, other strengths social tagging systems offer have been found. They equalize the lack of information quality and make social tagging systems valuable for competency acquisition.},

abstract={After the emergence of Web 2.0, online art museums have been evolving into participatory museums, in an attempt to increase the public's participation through utilizing social media. Among the many types of social media, social tagging has been receiving widespread attention as a tool for creating new metadata on museum collections through the participation and knowledge of the public. In the era of participatory museums, this study attempts to deduce a new method of museum management that utilizes social tagging as a means for communication between the museum and the audience. This study proposes specific museum management strategies and also provides a scenario using these strategies to reduce the semantic gap between museum experts (i.e. curators) and the audience. These were achieved by collecting and analyzing tags from users on actual museum collections. The strategies that are proposed discuss: 1) new museum collection information management, based on building public oriented museum collection metadata by social tagging, 2) public oriented curating, in which the visitors' perspective is reflected into exhibition planning, 3) a new way of surveying the public, through social tagging as a real-time public survey on how the public understands museum collections. These strategies, which showed worthy potential of being applied to museum management, were reviewed and discussed with museum experts at several workshops © Common Ground, Gunho Chae, Jungwha Kim, All Rights.},

abstract={While recent progress has been achieved in understanding the structure and dynamics of social tagging systems, we know little about the underlying user motivations for tagging, and how they influence resulting folksonomies and tags. This paper addresses three issues related to this question: 1.) What motivates users to tag resources, and in what ways is user motivation amenable to quantitative analysis? 2.) Does users' motivation for tagging vary within and across social tagging systems, and if so how? and 3.) How does variability in user motivation influence resulting tags and folksonomies? In this paper, we present measures to detect whether a tagger is primarily motivated by categorizing or describing resources, and apply the measures to datasets from 8 different tagging systems. Our results show that a) users' motivation for tagging varies not only across, but also within tagging systems, and that b) tag agreement among users who are motivated by categorizing resources is significantly lower than among users who are motivated by describing resources. Our findings are relevant for (i) the development of tag recommenders, (ii) the analysis of tag semantics and (iii) the design of search algorithms for social tagging systems.

abstract={Tapping into the wisdom of the crowd, social tagging can be considered an alternative mechanism - as opposed to Web search - for organizing and discovering information on the Web. Effective tag-based recommendation of information items, such as Web resources, is a critical aspect of this social information discovery mechanism. A precise understanding of the information structure of social tagging systems lies at the core of an effective tag-based recommendation method. While most of the existing research either implicitly or explicitly assumes a simple tripartite graph structure for this purpose, we propose a comprehensive information structure to capture all types of co-occurrence information in the tagging data. Based on the proposed information structure, we further propose a unified user profiling scheme to make full use of all available information. Finally, supported by our proposed user profile, we propose a novel framework for collaborative filtering in social tagging systems. In our proposed framework, we first generate joint item-tag recommendations, with tags indicating topical interests of users in target items. These joint recommendations are then refined by the wisdom from the crowd and projected to the item space for final item recommendations. Evaluation using three real-world datasets shows that our proposed recommendation approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging has become very popular with the rise of Web 2.0, making it an important piece of the puzzle that makes up the web phenomenon. In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand. Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the "noise". Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with 3-mode tensors, in order to capture the 3-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multi-way analysis, latent semantic correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Nevertheless, high-order tensors tend be sparse, a fact that hinders the application of multi-way analysis. To address this problem, we propose the application of kernel-based methods, which act as smoothing functions against sparsity. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Bibsonomy), indicates the superiority of the proposed method against the non kernel-based method and also against other baseline methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

It has been argued that the power of tagging lies in the ability for people to freely determine the appropriate tags for resources without having to rely on a predefined lexicon or hierarchy. The freeform nature of tagging causes a number of problems in this social classification scheme, such as synonymy and morphological variety. However, social tagging can be a valuable source of information to help in the organization of Web resources. In this paper we present an empirical analysis carried out to determine the importance of social tagging in Web page classification.

Choosing among so many options is challenging for users. As such, helping users easily find their desirable groups has become increasingly important. In this paper, we provide a systematic experimental evaluation of several collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend groups for Flickr users. In particular, we design and compare seven Flickr group recommendation models: three memory-based models and four model-based models. Our results suggest that model-based approaches are beneficial compared with memory-based approaches in terms of top-k recommendation metric. Models with tags perform well for sparse data, whereas models without tags are more suitable for dense data. Furthermore, incorporating tags in the recommendation algorithms leads to an improvement of precision on the top 2% performance. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={Social tagging, as a recent approach for creating metadata, has caught the attention of library and information science researchers. Many researchers recommend incorporating social tagging into the library environment and combining folksonomies with formal classification. However, some researchers are concerned with the quality issues of social annotation because of its uncontrolled nature. In this study, we compare social tags created by users from the LibraryThing website with the subject terms assigned by experts according to the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). The purpose of this study is to examine the difference and connections between social tags and expert-assigned subject terms and further explore the feasibility and obstacles of implementing social tagging in library systems. The results of our study show that it is possible to use social tags to improve the accessibility of library collections. However, the existence of non-subject-related tags may impede the application of social tagging in traditional library cataloguing systems. © 2010 The Author(s).},

Automatic tag suggestions can ease tagging activities of users. Various methods have been proposed for tag suggestions, which are roughly categorized into two approaches: content-based and graph-based. In this paper we present a heat diffusion method, i.e., FolkDiffusion, to rank tags for tag suggestions.

Experiments on real online social tagging datasets show the efficiency and effectiveness of FolkDiffusion compared to existing graph-based methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

However, user contributed tags lack explicit hierarchical structure, while many tag-based applications would benefit if such a structure presents. In this work, we explore the structure of tags with a directed and easy-to-evaluate relation, named as the subsumption relation. We propose three methods to discover the subsumption relation between tags. Specifically, the tagged document's content is used to find the relations, which leads to better result. Besides relation discovery, we also propose a greedy algorithm to eliminate the redundant relations by constructing a Layered Directed Acyclic Graph (Layered- DAG) of tags. We perform quantitative evaluations on two real world data sets. The results show that our methods outperform hierarchical clustering-based approach. Empirical study of the constructed Layered-DAG and error analysis are also provided.},

abstract={Tag recommender systems are often used in social tagging systems, a popular family of Web 2.0 applications, to assist users in the tagging process. But in cold-start situations i.e., when new users or resources enter the system, state-ofthe- art tag recommender systems perform poorly and are not always able to generate recommendations. Many user profiles contain untagged resources, which could provide valuable information especially for cold-start scenarios where tagged data is scarce. The existingmethods do not explore this additional information source. In this paper we propose to use a purely graph-based semi-supervised relational approach that uses untagged posts for addressing the cold-start problem. We conduct experiments on two real-life datasets and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in many cases. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper we propose a system that tackles the problem by two different angles: help (i) advertisers to create more efficient ads campaigns and (ii) ads providers to properly match ads content to keywords in search engines. We exploit semantic relations stored in the DBpedia dataset and use an hybrid ranking system to rank keywords and to expand queries formulated by the user. Inputs of our ranking system are (i) the DBpedia dataset; (ii) external information sources such as classical search engine results and social tagging systems. We compare our approach with other RDF similarity measures, proving the validity of our algorithm with an extensive evaluation involving real users. © 2010 ACM.},

Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a method which utilizes social tags as well as the content of academic conference in order to improve automatically identifying academic conference classification. The proposed method applies different automatic classification algorithms to improve classification quality by using social tags. Experimental results show that this method mentioned above performs better than the method which only utilizes the content to classify academic conference with 1% Precision measure score increase and 1.64% F1 measure score increase, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={By taking into account various co-occurence patterns from a folksonomy, semantic correspondences between tags have been discovered and applied to a number of applications (e.g., recommendation). In this paper, we propose a novel collective intelligence application for expanding and transforming queries for searching for multilingual resources. Thereby, multilingual tags (e.g., between 'Seoul' in English and 'Coree' in French) within a folksonomy have been analyzed whether they have a significant relationship or not. We have tested the proposed multilingual tag matching method by collecting real-world tagging information from several well-known social tagging websites (e.g., Del.icio.us), and applied to translating queries to other languages without any external dictionary. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

In this paper we propose to use hidden topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall. We first describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and then show how it can be used to rank resources in a social bookmarking system.

Our evaluations show that our LDA-based method significantly outperforms all of the baselines. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={In the past few years, tagging has gained large momentum as a user-driven approach for categorizing and indexing content on the Web. Mashups have recently joined the list of Web resources targeted for social tagging. In the context of the social Web, a mashup is a lightweight technique for integrating applications and data over the Web. Crafting new mashups is largely a subjective process motivated by the users' initial inspiration. In this paper, we propose a tag-based approach for predicting mashup patterns, thus deriving inspiration for potential new mashups from the community's consensus. Our approach applies association rule mining techniques to discover relationships between APIs and mashups based on their annotated tags. We also advocate the importance of the mined relationships as a valuable source for recommending mashup candidates while mitigating for common problems in recommender systems. We evaluate our methodology through experimentation using real-life dataset. Our results show that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy and outperforms a direct string matching approach that lacks the mining information. © 2010 ACM.},

In this context, recent web knowledge-sharing tools incite a growing change in the role of users from mere consumers to active knowledge producers. In this paper, we broaden the perspective on the approaches to information classification currently used in the web 2.0 by drawing on social theories that consider the production and consumption of categories as a situated activity that takes place within Communities of Practice. We analyze current approaches to information classification in the web (ontology-based versus social tagging approaches), arguing that approaches that impose standardization are not well suited to large-scale information systems in the web and its complex information ecology, where the existence of heterogeneous groups of users demands multiple perspectives of a given knowledge domain. We finally suggest that additional contextual information can be gathered in order to improve current classification approaches and the web systems in which these approaches are embedded. © 2010 IADIS.},

abstract={Social tagging can provide rich semantic information for large-scale retrieval in music discovery. Such collaborative intelligence, however, also generates a high degree of tags unhelpful to discovery, some of which obfuscate critical information. Towards addressing these shortcomings, tag recommendation for more robust music discovery is an emerging topic of significance for researchers. However, current methods do not consider diversity of music attributes, often using simple heuristics such as tag frequency for filtering out irrelevant tags. Music attributes encompass any number of perceived dimensions, for instance vocalness, genre, and instrumentation. Many of these are underrepresented by current tag recommenders. We propose a scheme for tag recommendation using Explicit Multiple Attributes based on tag semantic similarity and music content. In our approach, the attribute space is explicitly constrained at the outset to a set that minimizes semantic loss and tag noise, while ensuring attribute diversity. Once the user uploads or browses a song, the system recommends a list of relevant tags in each attribute independently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to consider Explicit Multiple Attributes for tag recommendation. Our system is designed for large-scale deployment, on the order of millions of objects. For processing large-scale music data sets, we design parallel algorithms based on the MapReduce framework to perform large-scale music content and social tag analysis, train a model, and compute tag similarity. We evaluate our tag recommendation system on CAL-500 and a large-scale data set (N = 77,448 songs) generated by crawling Youtube and Last.fm. Our results indicate that our proposed method is both effective for recommending attribute-diverse relevant tags and efficient at scalable processing. © 2010 ACM.},

However, due to resource constraints and a lack of accurate evaluation methods, English instructors can hardly assess student reading ability effectively. In past decades, learning by reading is known to be challenging for both teachers and students involved, especially for students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL). To cope with this problem, in this paper, we proposed a Tag-based assessment approach to both elicit reading behaviors from EFL learners and assist the teachers in tracing and evaluating the student reading ability effectively. The experimental results showed that the novel approach can not only find out the relations between learners' tags and their comprehension, but also help teachers to evaluate students' reading ability.},

However, even systems that apply this technique suffer with problems of lack of quality and information overload when the number of their users grows. Regardless of these problems, a wide range of systems became available allowing the categorization of several distinct kinds of objects, but without any level of integration among them. In this paper, we present a critical analysis about the folksonomy technique, their nature, advantages, problems and challenges. We also propose two approaches for improving the results obtained with folksonomy. Indeed, we argue that the question now is how and when assisting users when they are interacting with folksonomy-based systems, in order to make the use of folksonomy more useful in information organization and retrieval on the Web. © 2010 IADIS.},

abstract={Today folksonomies are of increasing importance, many different platforms emerged and millions of people use them. We consider the case of a user who enters such a social platform and wants to get an overview of a particular domain. The folksonomy provides abundant information for that task in the form of documents, tags on them and users who contribute documents and tags. We propose a process that identifies a small number of thematically "interesting objects" with respect to subject domains. Our novel algorithm CrossSense builds clusters composed of objects of different types upon a data tensor. It then selects pivot objects that are characteristic of one cluster and are associated with many objects of different types from the clusters. Then, CrossSense collects all the folksonomy content that is associated with a pivot object, i.e. the object's world: We rank pivot objects and present the top ones to the user. We have experimented with Bibsonomy data against a baseline that selects the most popular users, documents and tags, accompanied by the objects most frequently co-occurring with them. Our experiments show that our pivot objects exhibit more homogeneity and constitute a smaller set of entities to be inspected by the user.},

abstract={Collaboration and information sharing among government organizations is becoming increasingly important for promoting efficiency and productivity as well as for enhancing citizen services. With Internet connectivity widely available and with the ease-of-use of social media tools, citizens actively participate in producing content. However, the abundance of content causes another problem for governments-the difficulty of determining what truly useful and relevant information is to be shared for mission critical tasks and to produce better citizen services. Information resources, such as data, documents, multimedia objects and services stored in different agencies and produced by citizens need to be easily discovered and shared. We propose a data model of rich social tags and a Citizen-Government collaborative tagging environment} where governments and citizens can collaboratively annotate the resources, thus facilitating collaboration responsiveness through accessibility to information. The collaborative annotations capture not only the semantics but also the pragmatic and social aspects related to the resources, such as who, when, where, how and for what related tasks the resources are shared. The benefits of the a rich tag data model emphasizing the relationships of a tag to semantic, social, pragmatic and contextual reference frames include the ability to filter, discover and search new and dynamic as well as hidden resources, to navigate between resources in a search by traversing semantic relationships, and to recommend the most relevant government information even when distributed over different agencies. A distributed architecture of a government collaborative tagging system is proposed and tag-based search and recommendations are illustrated. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Automatic clustering of webpages helps a number of information retrieval tasks, such as improving user interfaces, collection clustering, introducing diversity in search results, etc. Typically, webpage clustering algorithms only use features extracted from the page-text. However, the advent of social-bookmarking websites, such as StumbleUpon1 and Delicious 2, has led to a huge amount of user-generated content such as the tag information that is associated with the webpages. In this paper, we present a subspace based feature extraction approach which leverages tag information to complement the page-contents of a webpage to extract highly discriminative features, with the goal of improved clustering performance. In our approach, we consider page-text and tags as two separate views of the data, and learn a shared subspace that maximizes the correlation between the two views. Any clustering algorithm can then be applied in this subspace. We compare our subspace based approach with a number of baselines that use tag information in various other ways, and show that the subspace based approach leads to improved performance on the webpage clustering task. Although our results here are on the webpage clustering task, the same approach can be used for webpage classification as well. In the end, we also suggest possible future work for leveraging tag information in webpage clustering, especially when tag information is present for not all, but only for a small number of webpages. © 2010 ACM.},

This study investigated the effects that the major context of use (work vs. non-work) has had on experiences with the social book marking service. A within-subject experiment was conducted with 77 subjects. Each took part in both work and non-work information tasks by interacting with six navigation aids. The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues. Understanding how users interact with various way finding cues can enlighten design considerations for refining social navigation functions. For social book marking service providers, the findings of this study offer new insights into user-centered design from an information interaction perspective. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a framework model that defines learning and knowledge building as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. This model brings together Scardamalia and Bereiter's theory of knowledge building and Nonaka's knowledge creation theory. We demonstrate how learning and knowledge building may occur when people interact with each other, using shared digital artifacts such as tag clouds (that result from social-tagging activities) or wikis. For both technologies, we provide illustrating data from two pilot studies. As an example, we refer to the learning processes that take place while searching for information in tag clouds. In addition, we illustrate processes of knowledge building by referring to users working on a wiki. In conclusion, the differences and similarities between these technologies are assessed, regarding their potential for knowledge building.},

abstract={Social tagging systems, known as "folksonomies," represent an important part of web resource discovery as they enable free and unrestricted browsing through information space. Folksonomies consisting of subject designators (tags) assigned by users, however, have one important drawback: they do not express semantic relationships, either hierarchical or associative, between tags. As a consequence, the use of tags to browse information resources requires moving from one resource to another, based on coincidence and not on the pre-established meaningful or logical connections that may exist between related resources. We suggest that the semantic structure of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) may be used in complementing and supporting tag-based browsing. In this work, two specific questions were investigated: 1) Are terms used as tags in folksonomies included in the UDC?; and, 2) Which facets of UDC match the characteristics of documents or information objects that are tagged in folksonomies? A collection of the most popular tags from Amazon, LibraryThing, Delicious, and 43 Things was investigated. The universal nature of UDC was examined through the universality of topics and facets covering diverse human interests which are at the same time interconnected and form a rich and intricate semantic structure. The results suggest that UDC-supported folksonomies could be implemented in resource discovery, in particular in library portals and catalogues.},

abstract={The terms 'learning objects' (LOs) and 'open educational resources' (OERs) are of interest in many areas of society, particularly in higher education, offering a valuable opportunity for equity and social justice through access, implementation and knowledge generation. For OERs to provide designers and users with all its advantages and features such as reusability, accessibility, interoperability, and applicability in the context of the objectives set for its creation, they must be aligned with the trends and developments in society as an end with technology as a medium. This paper presents research on three aspects of the future possibilities of OERs: accessibility standards, the incorporation of social components and the semantic web. Integrating social tools encourages the active involvement of OER designers and users, which in turn brings about collaborative learning. The creation of OER material is also faster, with easier access to them through search engines linked to educational platforms and social tools (Web 2.0). In addition, social tagging by users adds descriptive metadata to the OERs. Finally the use of intellectual property licenses which acknowledges the authors and allows free use of the material should be considered.},

abstract={It is a widely held belief among designers of social tagging systems that tag clouds represent a useful tool for navigation. This is evident in, for example, the increasing number of tagging systems offering tag clouds for navigational purposes, which hints towards an implicit assumption that tag clouds support efficient navigation. In this paper, we examine and test this assumption from a network-theoretic perspective, and show that in many cases it does not hold. We first model navigation in tagging systems as a bipartite graph of tags and resources and then simulate the navigation process in such a graph. We use network-theoretic properties to analyse the navigability of three tagging datasets with regard to different user interface restrictions imposed by tag clouds. Our results confirm that tag-resource networks have efficient navigation properties in theory, but they also show that popular user interface decisions (such as "pagination" combined with reverse-chronological listing of resources) significantly impair the potential of tag clouds as a useful tool for navigation. Based on our findings, we identify a number of avenues for further research and the design of novel tag cloud construction algorithms. Our work is relevant for researchers interested in navigability of emergent hypertext structures, and for engineers seeking to improve the navigability of social tagging systems. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We developed user models of knowledge exploration in a social tagging system to test the expertise rankings generated by a link-structure method and a semantic-structure method. The link-structure method assumed a referential definition of expertise, in which experts were users who tagged resources that were frequently tagged by other experts; the semantic-structure method assumed a representational definition of expertise, in which experts were users who had better knowledge of a particular domain and were better at assigning distinctive tags associated with certain domain-specific resources. Simulations results showed that the two methods of expert identification, although based on different assumptions, were in general consistent but did show significant differences. As expected, the link-structure method was better at facilitating exploration of popular "hot" topics than the semantic-structure method. However, the semantic-structure method was better at guiding users to find less popular "cold" topics than the link-structure method. Resources tagged by domain experts could contain cold topics that were associated with high quality tags, but these resources were less likely highlighted by the link-structure method. We argue that to facilitate knowledge exploration in social tagging systems, it is important to keep a good balance between helping user to follow hot topics and to discover cold topics by including expertise rankings generated by both link and semantic structures. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, we study the task of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging systems. To include candidate tags beyond the existing vocabularies of the query resource and of the query user, we examine recommendation methods that are based on personomy translation, and propose a probabilistic framework for adopting translations from similar users (neighbors). We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Assessing the value of individual users' contributions in peer-production systems is paramount to the design of mechanisms that support collaboration and improve users' experience. For instance, to incentivize contributions, file-sharing systems based on the BitTorrent protocol equate value with volume of contributed content and use a prioritization mechanism to reward users who contribute more. This approach and similar techniques used in resource-sharing systems rely on the fact that the physical resources shared among users are easily quantifiable. In contrast, information-sharing systems, like social tagging systems, lack the notion of a physical resource unit (e.g., content size, bandwidth) that facilitates the task of evaluating user contributions. For this reason, the issue of estimating the value of user contributions in information sharing systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces this problem and takes the first steps towards a solution. More precisely, it presents a framework to design algorithms that estimate the value of user contributions in tagging systems, proposes three complementary success criteria for potential solutions, and outlines the methodological evaluation challenges. © 2010 IEEE.},

Such a network is meant to simplify a search process for relevant content. The paper introduced the idea of constructing fuzzy sets based on the network of resources and tags.

abstract={Mashups are getting more complex with the addition of rich-media and real-time services. The new research challenges will be how to guarantee the quality of the aggregated services, and how to share them in a collaborative manner. This paper presents a metadata-based mashup framework in Next Generation Wireless Network (NGWN), which guarantees the quality and supports social interactions. In contrast to existing quality-assured approaches, the proposed mashup model addresses the quality management issue from a new perspective through defining the Quality of Service (QoS) metadata into two levels: fidelity (user perspective) and modality (application perspective). The quality is assured from quality-aware service selection and quality-adaptable service delivery. Furthermore, the mashup model is extended for users to annotate services collaboratively. The annotation occurs in two ways, social tagging (e.g., rating and comments) and QoS attributes (e.g., device type and access network, etc.). In order to apply this network-independent metadata model into NGWN architecture, we further introduce a new entity named Multimedia Mashup Engine (MME) which enables seamlessly access to the services and Adaptation Decision Taking (ADT). Finally, our prototype system and the simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed work. Copyright © 2010 Hongguang Zhang et al.},

abstract={Social tagging is an increasingly popular way to describe and classify documents on the web. However, the quality of the tags varies considerably since the tags are authored freely. How to rate the tags becomes an important issue. In this paper, we propose a topic-sensitive tag ranking (TSTR) approach to rate the tags on the web. We employ a generative probabilistic model to associate each tag with a distribution of topics. Then we construct a tag graph according to the co-tag relationships and perform a topic-level random walk over the graph to suggest a ranking score for each tag at different topics. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed tag ranking approach. © 2010 IEEE.},

Tags not only reflect users' preference, but also are a cue to describe the semantics of items. This paper formulates the problem of collaborative filtering as random walks over the user-item-tag tripartite graph. In order to alleviate the sparsity of tags, a lasso logistic regression model is conducted to accomplish tag expansion, i.e., adding relevant tags and removing irrelevant tags for each item.

abstract={Most approaches to classifying media content assume a fixed, closed vocabulary of labels. In contrast, we advocate machine learning approaches which take advantage of the millions of free-form tags obtainable via online crowd-sourcing platforms and social tagging websites. The use of such open vocabularies presents learning challenges due to typographical errors, synonymy, and a potentially unbounded set of tag labels. In this work, we present a new approach that organizes these noisy tags into well-behaved semantic classes using topic modeling, and learn to predict tags accurately using a mixture of topic classes. This method can utilize an arbitrary open vocabulary of tags, reduces training time by 94% compared to learning from these tags directly, and achieves comparable performance for classification and superior performance for retrieval. We also demonstrate that on open vocabulary tasks, human evaluations are essential for measuring the true performance of tag classifiers, which traditional evaluation methods will consistently underestimate. We focus on the domain of tagging music clips, and demonstrate our results using data collected with a human computation game called TagATune. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have emerged as an effective way for users to annotate and share objects on the Web. However, with the growth of social tagging systems, users are easily overwhelmed by the large amount of data and it is very difficult for users to dig out information that he/she is interested in. Though the tagging system has provided interest-based social network features to enable the user to keep track of other users' tagging activities, there is still no automatic and effective way for the user to discover other users with common interests. In this paper, we propose a User Recommendation (UserRec) framework for user interest modeling and interest-based user recommendation, aiming to boost information sharing among users with similar interests. Our work brings three major contributions to the research community: (1) we propose a tag-graph based community detection method to model the users' personal interests, which are further represented by discrete topic distributions; (2) the similarity values between users' topic distributions are measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence), and the similarity values are further used to perform interest-based user recommendation; and (3) by analyzing users' roles in a tagging system, we find users' roles in a tagging system are similar to Web pages in the Internet. Experiments on tagging dataset of Web pages (Yahoo! Delicious) show that UserRec outperforms other stat e-of - the-art recommender system approaches.

T hese social tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanism which assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them, where tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item. In this paper, we propose an approach for tag recommendation based on users' interest lattice matching(UILM). UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Web 2.0 and social/collaborative tagging have altered the traditional roles of indexer and user. Traditional indexing tools and systems assume the top-down approach to indexing in which a trained professional is responsible for assigning index terms to information sources with a potential user in mind. However, in today's Web, end users create, organize, index, and search for images and other information sources through social tagging and other collaborative activities. One of the impediments to user-centered indexing had been the cost of soliciting user-generated index terms or tags. Social tagging of images such as those on Flickr, an online photo management and sharing application, presents an opportunity that can be seized by designers of indexing tools and systems to bridge the semantic gap between indexer terms and user vocabularies. Empirical research on the differences and similarities between user-generated tags and index terms based on controlled vocabularies has the potential to inform future design of image indexing tools and systems. Toward this end, a random sample of Flickr images and the tags assigned to them were content analyzed and compared with another sample of index terms from a general image collection using established frameworks for image attributes and contents. The results show that there is a fundamental difference between the types of tags and types of index terms used. In light of this, implications for research into and design of user-centered image indexing tools and systems are discussed. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={For students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), reading exercises are critical not only for developing strong reading comprehension, but also for developing listening, speaking, and writing skills. Prior research suggests that social, collaborative learning environments are best suited for improving language ability. However, opportunities for English learners to collaboratively practice reading comprehension are minimal, and due to resource constraints and a lack of accurate evaluation methods, English instructors rarely assess student literacy effectively. In response to these problems, we propose a Tag-based Collaborative reading learning System (TACO) that makes use of Web 2.0 Internet social tagging techniques to provide a collaborative environment for reading English. We test our system's ability to both improve reading comprehension and aid teachers in accurately assessing literacy by conducting a three-month trial with 56 participating Taiwanese high school students from February to May 2009. During this period, post-testing results show a significant improvement in reading scores among participants in our tag-based system, and survey feedback from teachers suggests an improved capacity for literacy assessment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It analyzes the evolution of the usage of the most popular tags in each of these three social networks. We find that for different tagging systems, the dynamic features reflect different cognitive processes. At the macro level, the tag growth obeys power-law distribution for all three tagging systems with exponents lower than one. At the micro level, the tag growth of popular resources in all three tagging systems follows a similar power-law distribution. Moreover, we find that the exponents of tag growth varied in different evolving stages of popular individual resources. © 2010 IEEE.},

In spite of that, there is a growing mass of 3D content that is not associated to high-level information. This situation prevents any advanced use of the data available, such as searching, extraction or automatic manipulation of such content. In the last few years there have been a number of approaches for adding metadata to 3D content, but most of them use a top-down, designer driven, classification. This work proposes a different approach based on a bottom-up, user driven, classification.

The process of annotation and tag management by users of social networks is extremely easy and simple; however, it involves serious problems of navigation and search unlike what happens with taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies. The use of fuzzy similarity measures allows the correct identification of syntactic variations when tag lengths are greater or equal than five symbols, been inadequate for smaller length tags. This article presents a method that combines both fuzzy similarity and cosine measures in order to provide a proper classification of tags even with smaller tag lengths. This method allows the proper classification of the 95% of the syntactic variations of tags analyzed in the experiments.},

abstract={Web co-discovery, which means a certain group members collaboratively discover web resources for learning, has become imperative in authentic, open-ended learning environment. Group members may select, organize and further construct their own knowledge via web co-discovery activities. Current groupwares support web co-search, providing bookmark sharing, social tagging of bookmarks, and labor management functions. These groupwares efficiently facilitate distance Web co-discovery, however, face-to-face Web co-discovery is not supported. A framework to assist group members to integrate materials and ideas is not emphasized as well. In addition, a lack of a shared-focus may lead to barriers to social communications. Concept map, featuring linking related contributions, enables students to link, coordinate, organize and further integrate different ideas and discussion that reflect their reasoning. CELL (Contribution of Exchanging for Linking & Learning) is a groupware used concept map as the framework to facilitate group members to construct their collective knowledge (Liu and Kao, 2007). Therefore, this study implements CELL in a Web co-discovery activity and further explores whether 1:1 (1 mobile device for 1 person) better benefit members' communication and interaction. Nine graduate students participated in this study and were divided into three groups. Every group was asked use CELL to achieve Web co-discovery tasks in two settings both equipped with one shared-display, 1:1 and 1:3 (1 mobile device for 3 persons). The whole process was videotaped and transcribed in terms of interaction, conversation and users' operation behaviors. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to evaluate time ration of operate screen, classification of conversation and knowledge management. The result shows different environment may change group exploration strategy. 1:1 environment better supports the members' coordination and interaction and enrich the artifact of group exploration. However, participants in 1:1 environment may focus on personal device and thus show less oral communication than 1:3 environment. Future studies should be alerted to the limitation of 1:1 environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we present CRICOS, a web-based environment which enhances knowledge discovery and sharing within interconnected communities by integrating several community-driven technologies such as collaborative filtering, social navigation and social tagging. The communities are evolved in the system as their members create and improve both the content and the structure of their information spaces. The paper describes the facilities provided to the users by CRICOS and presents an empirical study of the use of the web-based environment in a university course. The results from the empirical study are encouraging regarding the usefulness and the usability of the provided facilities and revealed the students' positive attitude to the CRICOS web-based environment. © Common Ground, Stefanos Ziovas, Maria Grigoriadou, Maria Samarakou.},

abstract={The past few years have witnessed the great success of a new family of paradigms, so-called folksonomy, which allows users to freely associate tags with resources and efficiently manage them. In order to uncover the underlying structures and user behaviors in folksonomy, in this paper, we propose an evolutionary hypergraph model for explaining the emerging statistical properties. The present model introduces a novel mechanism that can not only assign tags to resources, but also retrieve resources via collaborative tags. We then compare the model with a real-world data set: Del.icio.us. Indeed, the present model shows considerable agreement with the empirical data in the following aspects: powerlaw hyperdegree distributions, negative correlation between clustering coefficients and hyperdegrees, and small average distances. Furthermore, the model indicates that most tagging behaviors are motivated by labeling tags on resources, and the tag plays a significant role in effectively retrieving interesting resources and making acquaintances with congenial friends. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the structure and function of folksonomy. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

In this paper, we propose a bipartite graph-based dynamic ranking algorithm, RicoRank (Relevance and Importance inCOrporated RANK), for improving search performance in folksonomies. We combine both the query relevance and importance effectively to generate the final ranking score. We derive the query relevance from a smoothed probabilistic generative model that demonstrates user interest and resource content. We characterize the importance with the mutual reinforcement between users and resources. We assign each mutual reinforcing relation with a weight corresponding to the coherence between the associated tags, the user interest and the resource content. Finally, we employ an iterative procedure, which incorporates well with both query relevance and importance, to simultaneously compute the ranking scores of users and resource. We conduct experiments on a dataset collected from a real-world system. Experimental results on both user expertise and resource quality ranking show a convincing performance of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic generative model, called Topic-Perspective Model, for simulating the generation process of social annotations. Different from other generative models, in our model, the tag generation process is separated from the content term generation process. While content terms are only generated from resource topics, social tags are generated by resource topics and user perspectives together. The proposed probabilistic model can produce more useful information than any other models proposed before. The parameters learned from this model include: (1) the topical distribution of each document, (2) the perspective distribution of each user, (3) the word distribution of each topic, (4) the tag distribution of each topic, (5) the tag distribution of each user perspective, (6) and the probabilistic of each tag being generated from resource topics or user perspectives. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better generalization performance or tag prediction ability than other two models proposed in previous research. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have become increasingly popular for sharing and organizing web resources. Tag recommendation is a common feature of social tagging systems. Social tagging by nature is an incremental process, meaning that once a user has saved a web page with tags, the tagging system can provide more accurate predictions for the user, based on the user's incremental behavior. However, existing tag prediction methods do not consider this important factor, in which their training and test datasets are either split by a fixed time stamp or randomly sampled from a larger corpus. In our temporal experiments, we perform a time-sensitive sampling on an existing public dataset, resulting in a new scenario which is much closer to "real-world". In this paper, we address the problem of tag prediction by proposing a probabilistic model for personalized tag prediction. The model is a Bayesian approach, and integrates three factors - an ego-centric effect, environmental effects and web page content. Two methods - both intuitive calculation and learning optimization - are provided for parameter estimation. Pure graph-based methods which may have significant constraints (such as every user, every item and every tag has to occur in at least p posts) cannot make a prediction in most "real world" cases while our model improves the F-measure by over 30% compared to a leading algorithm on a publicly-available real-world dataset. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The use of social software in libraries and the possibilities to open up and enhance on existing library services lately has received a lot of interest. At the library of the University of Hildesheim a social tagging service was developed and evaluated in use (cf. Heuwing 2008). Users were given the possibility to save resources from the online public access library catalogue in their personal collection and attach keywords to these resources. The service was deployed as a prototype and was positively received by a group of test users who used the service in different ways. A survey among users revealed that the key motivation to use the service was information sharing among students, while personal information management was only important to a smaller group of users. The results of the project demonstrate the possibilities of social tagging at university libraries and show the potential of integration with other services both inside and outside the university.},

abstract={In this paper, I describe a better way to compute the information similarity between two users who are unilaterally connected. Unilateral relations are unidirectional connections and gain attention with the success of social tagging and microblogging systems. The relations are convenient and less bounded since people can make the connection without mutual agreement once they perceive that other users' information is worth. Using a social bookmarking data set, Delicious, I found that the traditional item unit-based similarity measures are not enough to show the common interests between a pair of unilaterally connected users. The similarity measure on the higher level such as metadata (root address of each URL) and macro-level tags (tags regardless of the annotated information item) showed better results. The significantly better results in metadata and macro-tag level similarity were also shown in the indirect relations, as well. I interpreted this result to mean that semantic information such as metadata and tags represent users' cognitive understanding of corresponding information. Therefore, in social tagging systems, it is better to match users not based on item-level similarity but based on the similarity on a higher level which embeds more semantic meanings. © 2010 ACM.},

This paper seeks to investigate ways of enhancing social tagging via knowledge organization systems, with a view to improving the quality of tags for increased information discovery and retrieval performance. Design/methodology/approach: Enhanced tagging interfaces were developed for exemplar online repositories, and trials were undertaken with author and reader groups to evaluate the effectiveness of tagging augmented with control vocabulary for subject indexing of papers in online repositories. Findings: The results showed that using a knowledge organisation system to augment tagging does appear to increase the effectiveness of non-specialist users (that is, without information science training) in subject indexing. Research limitations/implications: While limited by the size and scope of the trials undertaken, these results do point to the usefulness of a mixed approach in supporting the subject indexing of online resources.

abstract={Social tagging is an innovative and powerful mechanism introduced with Web 2.0: it shifts the task of classifying resources from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems suggest resources to users based on collaborative filtering techniques, typically by exploiting correlations between individual user ratings of the resources they are interested in. Tags are a new form of metadata increasingly used in social bookmarking sites by users to annotate bookmarked resources. Our goal is to harness the implicit knowledge contained in these tags to improve the quality of recommendations to users. We use both tag and resource-interest knowledge in our user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to profile users and compute similarity between them. Sparsity is a challenge which occurs in a Social Recommendation System when the number of tags and resources to profile a user are inadequate to provide good quality recommendations. To address this problem, we designed a Tripartite Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (TRNNA) which combines three views of the data: the tags (TNNA), the resources (RNNA) and the collection of tags for a resource (Resource Vector of Tags or RVTA). TRNNA computes distance between users based on Cosine Similarity, which in turn is used to provide a high quality recommendation of resources. Our empirical evaluation, based on a user study in which research papers were recommended to participants and relevance of recommendation was evaluated, indicates that TRNNA and RNNA provide better recommendation than TNNA and RVTA. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The recent proliferation of crowd computing initiatives on the web calls for smarter methodologies and tools to annotate, query and explore repositories. There is the need for scalable techniques able to return also approximate results with respect to a given query as a ranked set of promising alternatives. In this paper we concentrate on annotation and retrieval of software components, exploiting semantic tagging relying on Linked Open Data. We focus on DBpedia and propose a new hybrid methodology to rank resources exploiting: (i) the graph-based nature of the underlying RDF structure, (ii) context independent semantic relations in the graph and (iii) external information sources such as classical search engine results and social tagging systems. We compare our approach with other RDF similarity measures, proving the validity of our algorithm with an extensive evaluation involving real users. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social tagging or collaborative tagging has become a new trend in the organization, management, and discovery of digital information. The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={While recent research has advanced our understanding about the structure and dynamics of social tagging systems, we know little about (i) the underlying motivations for tagging (why users tag), and (ii) how they inuence the properties of resulting tags and folksonomies. In this paper, we focus on problem (i) based on a distinction between two types of user motivations that we have identified in earlier work: Categorizers vs. Describers. To that end, we systematically define and evaluate a number of measures designed to discriminate between describers, i.e. users who use tags for describing resources as opposed to categorizers, i.e. users who use tags for categorizing resources. Subsequently, we present empirical findings from qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the measures on real world tagging behavior. In addition, we conducted a recommender evaluation in which we study the effectiveness of each of the presented measures and found the measure based on the tag content to be the most accurate in predicting the user behavior closely followed by a content independent measure. The overall contribution of this paper is the presentation of empirical evidence that tagging motivation can be approximated with simple statistical measures. Our research is relevant for (a) designers of tagging systems aiming to better understand the motivations of their users and (b) researchers interested in studying the effects of users' tagging motivation on the properties of resulting tags and emergent structures in social tagging systems.

abstract={Purpose - Knowledge capture from experts is important when that knowledge is of value, scarce, and threatened by loss, as is the case with the expected departure of "baby boomers" from the workforce. This paper seeks to provide a theoretically grounded, practical methodology for initial knowledge capture and ongoing maintenance of this knowledge using "Web 2.0" technologies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper used a participatory action research project in which a methodology was developed for the capture of knowledge from experts in an organization experiencing both knowledge loss and rapid growth. The methodology used simple, affordable technologies such as digital cameras and digital editors, Wikis with a "semantic web" and social tagging. Findings - The paper was able to integrate an initial knowledge capture into an ongoing cycle of knowledge organizing, sharing and maintenance. It was found that, whilst it is an economical and appropriate solution to problems of knowledge loss and knowledge sharing, sustainability of the information capture and its validation and ongoing maintenance by others require explicit management attention. Research limitations/implications - This methodology provides a process model for investigating the conversion of tacit to explicit knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge capture methods for inter-generational knowledge in particular, but knowledge capture from experts in general. Practical implications - The knowledge capture methodology derived in this project can be used by managers and practitioners to address knowledge loss and under-utilization. Originality/value - The methodology is original and based on a process model of tacit-explicit knowledge conversion. It uses cheap accessible tools, integrates an initial capture into an ongoing lifecycle, and uses modern, lightweight Web 2.0 tools and concepts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We propose an algorithm to predict users' future bookmarking using social bookmarking data. It is a problem that primitive collaborative filtering cannot exactly catch users' preferences in social bookmarkings containing enormous items (URLs) because in many cases user's adoption data is sparse. There can be various influences on bookmarking such as effects from the environment and changes in user preference. We use temporal sequence among the bookmarking-users to represent word-of-mouth and among the bookmarked-URLs to represent user's interest, and model each sequential order as a continuous-time Markov chain. This idea comes from diffusion of innovation theory. A transition probability from a state (user/URL) to another state is defined by the transition rate calculated from the time taken for the transition. We predicted user's preferences through a combination of estimating the most likely transition between users using URLs as input and between URLs using users as input. We conducted evaluation experiments with a social bookmarking service in Japan called Hatena bookmark. The proposed algorithm predicts users' preferences with higher accuracy than collaborative filtering or simple transition models based on either user or URL. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging services allow users to annotate various online resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). They not only facilitate the users in finding and organizing online resources, but also provide meaningful collaborative semantic data which can potentially be exploited by recommender systems. Traditional studies on recommender systems focused on user rating data, while recently social tagging data is becoming more and more prevalent. How to perform resource recommendation based on tagging data is an emerging research topic. In this paper we consider the problem of document (e.g. Web pages, research papers) recommendation using purely tagging data. That is, we only have data containing users, tags, documents and the relationships among them. We propose a novel graph-based representation learning algorithm for this purpose. The users, tags and documents are represented in the same semantic space in which two related objects are close to each other. For a given user, we recommend those documents that are sufficiently close to him/her. Experimental results on two data sets crawled from Del.icio.us and CiteULike show that our algorithm can generate promising recommendations and outperforms traditional recommendation algorithms. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract={Tag recommendation is a common way to enrich the textual annotation of multimedia contents. However, state-of-the-art recommendation methods are built upon the pair-wised tag relevance, which hardly capture the context of the web video, i.e., when who are doing what at where. In this paper we propose the context-oriented tag recommendation (CtextR) approach, which expands tags for web videos under the context-consistent constraint. Given a web video, CtextR first collects the multi-form WWW resources describing the same event with the video, which produce an informative and consistent context; and then, the tag recommendation is conducted based on the obtained context. Experiments on an 80,031 web video collection show CtextR recommends various relevant tags to web videos. Moreover, the enriched tags improve the performance of web video categorization. © 2010 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={The World Wide Web has provided users with the opportunity to access from any computer the largest set of information ever existing. Researchers have analyzed how such users surf the Web, and such analysis has been used to improve existing services (e.g., by means of data mining and personalization techniques) as well as the generation of new ones (e.g., online targeted advertisement). In recent years, a new trend has developed by which users do not need a computer to access the Web. Instead, the low prices of mobile data connections allow them to access it anywhere anytime. Some studies analyze how users access the Web on their handsets, but these studies use only navigation logs from a specific portal. Therefore, very little attention (due to the complexity of obtaining the data) has been given to how users surf the Web (off-portal) from their mobiles and how that information could be used to build user profiles. This paper analyzes full navigation logs of a large set of mobile users in a developed country, providing useful information about the way those users access the Web. Additionally, it explores how navigation logs can be categorized, and thus user's interest can be modeled, by using online sources of information such as Web directories and social tagging systems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube, del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success. State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a semantic imitation model of social tagging and exploratory search based on theories of cognitive science. The model assumes that social tags evoke a spontaneous tag-based topic inference process that primes the semantic interpretation of resource contents during exploratory search, and the semantic priming of existing tags in turn influences future tag choices. The model predicts that (1) users who can see tags created by others tend to create tags that are semantically similar to these existing tags, demonstrating the social influence of tag choices; and (2) users who have similar information goals tend to create tags that are semantically similar, but this effect is mediated by the semantic representation and interpretation of social tags. Results from the experiment comparing tagging behavior between a social group (where participants can see tags created by others) and a nominal group (where participants cannot see tags created by others) confirmed these predictions. The current results highlight the critical role of human semantic representations and interpretation processes in the analysis of large-scale social information systems. The model implies that analysis at both the individual and social levels are important for understanding the active, dynamic processes between human knowledge structures and external folksonomies. Implications on how social tagging systems can facilitate exploratory search, interactive information retrievals, knowledge exchange, and other higher-level cognitive and learning activities are discussed. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={People share pictures online to increase their social presence. However, recent studies have shown that most of the content shared in social networks is not looked at by peers. Proper metadata can be generated and used to improve the retrieval of this content. In spite of this, we still lack solutions for collecting valid descriptors of content that can be used effectively in the context of social information navigation. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on persuasive techniques to support peers in providing metadata for multimedia content that can be used for a person's self-promotion. Through an iterative design and experimentation process, we demonstrate how this methodology can be used effectively to increase one's social presence thus building more enjoyable, rich, and creative content that is shared in the social network. In addition, we highlight implications that inform the design of social games with a purpose. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Our study compared how experts and novices performed exploratory search using a traditional search engine and a social tagging system. As expected, results showed that social tagging systems could facilitate exploratory search for both experts and novices. We, however, also found that experts were better at interpreting the social tags and generating search keywords, which made them better at finding information in both interfaces. Specifically, experts found more general information than novices by better interpretation of social tags in the tagging system; and experts also found more domain-specific information by generating more of their own keywords. We found a dynamic interaction between knowledge-in-the-head and knowledge-in-the-social-web that although information seekers are more and more reliant on information from the social Web, domain expertise is still important in guiding them to find and evaluate the information. Implications on the design of social search systems that facilitate exploratory search are also discussed. © 2010 ACM.},

We observed that experts express greater feelings of ownership towards their contributions to the system and the museum in general.

abstract={Rather than a document that is constantly being written as in the wiki approach, the Living Document (LD) is a document that also acts as a document router, operating by means of structured and organized social tagging and using existing ontologies. It offers an environment where users can manage papers and related information, share their knowledge with their peers and discover hidden associations amongst the shared knowledge. The LD builds upon both the Semantic Web, which values the integration of well-structured data, and the Social Web, which aims to facilitate interaction amongst people by means of user-generated content. In this vein, the LD is similar to a social networking system, with users as central nodes in the network, with the difference that interaction is focused on papers rather than people. Papers, with their ability to represent research interests, expertise, affiliations, and links to web based tools and databanks, are the central axis for interaction amongst users. To support this, we have also implemented a novel web prototype that enables researchers to accomplish three activities central to the Semantic Web vision: organizing, sharing and discovering. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Web 2.0 represents an emerging suite of applications that hold immense potential in enriching communication, enabling collaboration and fostering innovation. However, little work has been done hitherto to research Web 2.0 applications in library websites. This paper addresses the following three research questions: (a) To what extent are Web 2.0 applications prevalent in libraries?; (b) In what ways have Web 2.0 applications been used in libraries?; and (c) Does the presence of Web 2.0 applications enhance the quality of library websites? Divided equally between public and academic, 120 libraries' websites from North America, Europe and Asia were sampled and analyzed using a three-step content analysis method. The findings suggest that the order of popularity of Web 2.0 applications implemented in libraries is: blogs, RSS, instant messaging, social networking services, wikis, and social tagging applications. Also, libraries have recognized how different Web 2.0 applications can be used complementarily to increase the level of user engagement. Finally, the presence of Web 2.0 applications was found to be associated with the overall quality, and in particular, service quality of library websites. This paper concludes by highlighting implications for both librarians and scholars interested to delve deeper into the implementation of Web 2.0 applications. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={One of the most exciting recent developments in web science is social tagging that enables users to easily annotate web content using free form keywords. Well known examples include Delicious, Flickr, and YouTube which respectively allow users to tag web pages, images, and videos. A tag cloud represents an aggregation of tags to characterize some entity of interest, and it has many potential applications particularly in the context of multimedia information retrieval and recommendation. In this paper, we present a novel method that computes the similarity between tag clouds through effectively incorporating tag similarity information. The considered problem has several unique characteristics mainly due to the informal nature of tag descriptions as well as the frequent tag updates, making it difficult to apply existing approaches in the information retrieval literature. Experimental results on Delicious data show that the proposed scheme can effectively utilize the tag similarity to improve the performance of tag cloud similarity ranking. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the rapid development of social tagging systems, large amount of social annotations have been created by large crowd of collaborative users, forming a new dimension of accessing the quality of Web pages. This paper proposes a novel page ranking algorithm for improving Web search performance. The authors explored the social annotations by effectively combining the language model of pages and users with the mutual reinforcement between pages and users, developed a probabilistic generative model to demonstrate the tagging scheme of users and resources, and modeled the mutual reinforcement relation between pages and users with a bipartite graph. Moreover, the authors assigned each one of the mutual reinforcement relations with a weight representing the coherence between annotating tags and language model of pages and users, and computed the importance of pages and users simultaneously in an iterative fashion based on both query relevance and mutual reinforcement. Experiments on a dataset collected from a real-world social tagging system show that the query model and mutual reinforcement model developed in this paper can effectively improve the performance of the ranking algorithm, outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in retrieval performance measured by MAP and NDCG.},

Such systems typically provide simple tag recommendations to increase the number of tags assigned to resources.

We describe the resulting tripartite topic model in detail and show how it can be utilised to make personalised tag suggestions. Then, using data from a large-scale, real life tagging system, test our system against several baseline methods. Our experiments show a statistically significant increase in performance of our model over all key metrics, indicating that the model could be successfully used to provide further social tagging tools such as resource suggestion and collaborative filtering. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative analysis of the "messiness" of the social tags in folksonomies to see how useful they might be for general search and retrieval in library catalogs. Design/methodology/approach: The study harvested tags for ten books from LibraryThing measuring characteristics which would hinder search and retrieval in library catalogs. Findings: Because there are no rules governing the way people tag, folksonomies suffer from a certain degree of messiness and inconsistency. More than a third of this messiness is in the form of tag variations followed by tags containing non-alphabetic characters. The other types of messiness measured were less significant, making tag variations the most prominent hindrance to search and retrieval. Originality/value: The paper supplies quantitative support for giving users guidance for creating tags in a library catalog. However, libraries should remember that part of the attraction of social tagging is its open and self-created environment and that too many rules and regulations may discourage participation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={When information is known only to friends in a social network, traditional crowdsourcing mechanisms struggle to motivate a large enough user population and to ensure accuracy of the collected information. We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={We present an extension of a computational cognitive model of social tagging and exploratory search called the semantic imitation model. The model assumes a probabilistic representation of semantics for both internal and external knowledge, and utilizes social tags as navigational cues during exploratory search. We used the model to generate a measure of information scent that controls exploratory search behavior, and simulated the effects of multiple presentations of navigational cues on both simple information retrieval and exploratory search performance based on a previous model called SNIF-ACT. We found that search performance can be significantly improved by these model-based presentations of navigational cues for both experts and novices. The result suggested that exploratory search performance depends critically on the match between internal knowledge (domain expertise) and external knowledge structures (folksonomies). Results have significant implications on how social information systems should be designed to facilitate knowledge exchange among users with different background knowledge. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Based on the finding that domain expertise could influence search behavior in traditional search engines, we hypothesized and tested the idea that domain expertise would have similar influence on search behavior in a social tagging system. We conducted an experiment comparing search behavior of experts and novices when they searched using a tradition search engine and a social tagging system. Results from our experiment showed that experts relied more on their own domain knowledge to generate search queries, while novices were influenced more by social cues in the social tagging system. Experts were also found to conform to each other more than novices in their choice of bookmarks and tags. Implications on the design of future social information systems are discussed.

abstract={Social tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. Thus, the tagging information can be used to make recommendations. This paper presents an overview of the field of social tagging systems which can be used for extending the capabilities of recommender systems. Various limitations of the current generation of social tagging systems and possible extensions that can provide better recommendation capabilities are also considered. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Social Tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, Web links, products, etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) method and the Kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Websites that provide content creation and sharing features have become quite popular recently. These sites allow users to categorize and browse content using tags or free-text keyword topics. Since users contribute and tag social media content across a variety of social web platforms, creating new knowledge from distributed tag data has become a matter of performing various tasks, including publishing, aggregating, integrating, and republishing tag data. However, there are a number of issues in relation to data sharing and interoperability when processing tag data across heterogeneous tagging platforms. In this paper we introduce a semantic tag model that aims to explicitly offer the necessary structure, semantics and relationships between tags. This approach provides an improved opportunity for representing tag data in the form of reusable constructs at a semantic level. We also demonstrate a prototype that consumes and makes use of shared tag metadata across heterogeneous sources.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a query expansion and user profile enrichment approach to improve the performance of recommender systems operating on a folksonomy, storing and classifying the tags used to label a set of available resources. Our approach builds and maintains a profile for each user. When he submits a query (consisting of a set of tags) on this folksonomy to retrieve a set of resources of his interest, it automatically finds further "authoritative" tags to enrich his query and proposes them to him. All "authoritative" tags considered interesting by the user are exploited to refine his query and, along with those tags directly specified by him, are stored in his profile in such a way to enrich it. The expansion of user queries and the enrichment of user profiles allow any content-based recommender system operating on the folksonomy to retrieve and suggest a high number of resources matching with user needs and desires. Moreover, enriched user profiles can guide any collaborative filtering recommender system to proactively discover and suggest to a user many resources relevant to him, even if he has not explicitly searched for them. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={As more people adopt tagging practices, social tagging systems tend to form rich knowledge repositories that enable the extraction of patterns reflecting the way content semantics is perceived by the web users. This is of particular importance, especially in the case of multimedia content, since the availability of such content in the web is very high and its efficient retrieval using textual annotations or content-based automatically extracted metadata still remains a challenge. It is argued that complementing multimedia analysis techniques with knowledge drawn from web social annotations may facilitate multimedia content management. This chapter focuses on analyzing tagging patterns and combining them with content feature extraction methods, generating, thus, intelligence from multimedia social tagging systems. Emphasis is placed on using all available “tracks” of knowledge, that is tag co-occurrence together with semantic relations among tags and low-level features of the content. Towards this direction, a survey on the theoretical background and the adopted practices for analysis of multimedia social content are presented.

abstract={Tagging has become a main tool for Internet users to describe and advertise various web resources. The relatively flat structure of the tag space poses lots of challenges in tag based query engines. Many data-centric algorithms have been proposed to discover structures from the flat tag space and to improve query results. At the same time, lots of social networking sites start to provide mechanisms allowing users to specify simple hierarchical structures. The group concept in Flickr is a good example of such user specified structure. Users can create a group with predefined themes. Other users can add their resources to several related groups voluntarily or by invitation. These groups are analogue to categories in a cataloguing system. This user specified structure would ideally improve the precision of tag based query. However, categories can be created by any user and public categories like groups are open for users to add resources in. More often than not, a simple category title does not give enough information on its content. In this paper we propose two algorithms, traditional IR cosine similarity approach and frequent pattern matching approach, to recommend categories to a given resource. We evaluate our algorithms using groups and photos from Flickr. Both algorithms achieve promising results in terms of precision in general. We also analyse strength and weakness of the two algorithms with respect to features of test data. We believe such recommendation mechanism is an important complement to any user specified hierarchical structure. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many cultural heritage organizations responsible for providing access to large online collections recognize the potential value that social tagging systems can add to their collections. Projects such as Steve.Museum aim to give online users a voice in describing the content of publicly-held collections of digital heritage, through online social tagging and annotation tools. However, there are a number of unresolved challenges associated with re-using community tags, aggregating them within the museum's authoritative metadata stores and incorporating them within museum "metasearch" services. Although social tagging sites provide simple, user-relevant tags, there are issues associated with the quality of the metadata, the scalability compared with conventional indexing systems and a lack of interoperability across social tagging and annotation systems. In this paper, we propose an integrated system that overcomes many of the limitations of social tagging systems and maximizes their potential value-add within the context of museum collections. The Harvesting and Aggregating Networked Annotations (HarvANA) system firstly enables communities to attach tags/annotations to digitized 3D museum artefacts through web-based annotation services. The annotations/tags are represented using a standardized but extensible Resource Description Framework (RDF) model and an ontology-directed folksonomy. This approach facilitates interoperability between tags/annotations. Secondly, the system uses the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) API to automatically harvest the annotations/tags from distributed community servers. The harvested annotations are aggregated with the authoritative museum metadata in a centralized metadata store. The HarvANA system provides a streamlined, interoperable, scalable approach that enables cultural organizations to leverage community enthusiasm for tagging and annotation, augment their institutional metadata with community tags and enhance their discovery and browse services over 3D models. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract={The recent blow up of crowd computing initiatives on the web calls for smarter methodologies and tools to annotate, query and explore repositories. There is the need for scalable techniques able to return also approximate results with respect to a given query as a ranked set of promising alternatives. In this paper we concentrate on annotation and retrieval of software components, exploiting semantic tagging relying on DBpedia. We propose a new hybrid methodology to rank resources in this dataset. Inputs of our ranking system are (i) the DBpedia dataset; (ii) external information sources such as classical search engine results, social tagging systems and wikipedia-related information. We compare our approach with other RDF similarity measures, proving the validity of our algorithm with an extensive evaluation involving real users.},

abstract={As opposed to Web search, social tagging can be considered an alternative technique tapping into the wisdom of the crowd for organizing and discovering information on the Web. Effective tag-based recommendation of information items is critical to the success of this social information discovery mechanism. Over the past few years, there have been a growing number of studies aiming at improving the item recommendation quality of collaborative filtering (CF) methods by leveraging tagging information. However, a critical problem that often severely undermines the performance of tag-based CF methods, i.e., sparsity of user-item and user-tag interactions, is still yet to be adequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, which deals with this data sparsity problem by making effective use of unlabeled items and propagating users' preference information between the item space and the tag space. Empirical evaluation using real-world tagging data demonstrates the utility of the proposed framework.},

abstract={Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in music information retrieval (MIR). It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former. © 2009, IEEE},

abstract={Increasing numbers of museums and cultural institutions are using 3D laser scanning techniques to preserve cultural artefacts as 3D digital models, that are then accessible to curators, scholars and the general public via Web interfaces to online galleries. Museums are finding the cost of providing metadata for such collections prohibitive and are keen to explore how they might exploit Web 2.0 social tagging and annotation services to capture community knowledge and enrich the contextual metadata associated with their collections. Although there exist some annotation services for 3D objects, they are designed for specific disciplines, not Web-based or depend on proprietary software and formats. The majority also only support the attachment of annotations to whole objects-not points, 3D surface regions or 3D segments. This paper describes the 3DSA (3D Semantic Annotation) system developed at the University of Queensland that enables users to attach annotations to 3D digital artefacts. The 3DSA system is based on a common interoperable annotation model (the Open Annotations Collaboration (OAC) model) and uses ontology-based tags to support further semantic annotation and reasoning. This common approach enables annotations to be re-used, migrated and shared-across annotation clients and across different 3D and 2.5D digital representations of the one cultural artifact. Such interoperability is essential if cultural institutions are to easily harness knowledge from a broad range of users, including curators, students and remote Indigenous communities, with different client capabilities. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2010.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general framework that incorporates collaborative social tagging with a novel ontology scheme conveying multiple perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a framework where multiple users tag the same object (an image in this case) and an ontology is extended based on these tags while being tolerant of different points of view. Both the tagging and the ontological models are intentionally designed to suit the multi-perspective environment. The paper develops a method based on a set of rules that determine how to associate new concepts to predefined perspectives (in addition to determining relations to topics or other concepts as typically done in previous research) and how to insert and maintain multiple perspectives. Findings - This case study experiment, with a set of selected annotated images, indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model. Originality/value - The proposed framework characterises the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development of a multi-perspective ontology and its application to improve image annotation, searching and browsing. The significance of this research is that it focuses on exploring the impact of creating a constantly evolving ontology based on collaborative tagging. The paper is not aware of any other work that has attempted to devise such an environment and to study its dynamics. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in many Web 2.0 applications where users can annotate resources (e.g. Web pages) with arbitrary keywords (i.e. tags). A tag recommendation module can assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them. It can also be directly used to expand the set of tags annotating a resource. The benefits are twofold: improving user experience and enriching the index of resources. However, the former one is not emphasized in previous studies, though a lot of work has reported that different users may describe the same concept in different ways. We address the problem of personalized tag recommendation for text documents. In particular, we model personalized tag recommendation as a "query and ranking" problem and propose a novel graph-based ranking algorithm for interrelated multi-type objects. When a user issues a tagging request, both the document and the user are treated as a part of the query. Tags are then ranked by our graph-based ranking algorithm which takes into consideration both relevance to the document and preference of the user. Finally, the top ranked tags are presented to the user as suggestions. Experiments on a large-scale tagging data set collected from Del.icio.us have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms algorithms which fail to consider the diversity of different users' interests.

The main issue in this problem is the sense disambiguation of tags given with few textual contexts. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method represents both tags and its translation candidates as networks of co-occurring tags since a network allows richer expression of contexts than other expressions such as co-occurrence vectors. The method translates a tag by selecting the optimal one from possible candidates based on a network similarity even when neither the textual contexts nor sophisticated language resources are available. The experiments on the MIR Flickr-2008 test set show that the proposed method achieves 90.44% accuracy in translating tags from English into German, which is significantly higher than the baseline methods of a frequency based translation and a co-occurrence-based translation.

abstract={Social network systems, like last.fm, play a significant role in Web 2.0, containing large amounts of multimedia-enriched data that are enhanced both by explicit user-provided annotations and implicit aggregated feedback describing the personal preferences of each user. It is also a common tendency for these systems to encourage the creation of virtual networks among their users by allowing them to establish bonds of friendship and thus provide a novel and direct medium for the exchange of data. We investigate the role of these additional relationships in developing a track recommendation system. Taking into account both the social annotation and friendships inherent in the social graph established among users, items and tags, we created a collaborative recommendation system that effectively adapts to the personal information needs of each user. We adopt the generic framework of Random Walk with Restarts in order to provide with a more natural and efficient way to represent social networks. In this work we collected a representative enough portion of the music social network last.fm, capturing explicitly expressed bonds of friendship of the user as well as social tags. We performed a series of comparison experiments between the Random Walk with Restarts model and a user-based collaborative filtering method using the Pearson Correlation similarity. The results show that the graph model system benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge. In addition, the graph model outperforms the standard collaborative filtering method. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.

abstract={Social tagging is an increasingly popular phenomenon with substantial impact on the way we perceive and understand the Web. For the many Web resources that are not self-descriptive, such as images, tagging is the sole way of associating them with concepts explicitly expressed in text. Consequently, users are encouraged to assign tags to Web resources, and tag recommenders are being developed to stimulate the re-use of existing tags in a consistent way. However, a tag still and inevitably expresses the personal perspective of each user upon the tagged resource. This personal perspective should be taken into account when assessing the similarity of resources with help of tags. In this paper, we focus on similarity-based clustering of tagged items, which can support several applications in social-tagging systems, like information retrieval, providing recommendations, or the establishment of user profiles and the discovery of topics. We show that it is necessary to capture and exploit the multiple values of similarity reflected in the tags assigned to the same item by different users. We model the items, the tags on them and the users who assigned the tags in a multigraph structure. To discover clusters of similar items, we extend spectral clustering, an approach successfully used for the clustering of complex data, into a method that captures multiple values of similarity between any two items. Our experiments with two real social-tagging data sets show that our new method is superior to conventional spectral clustering that ignores the existence of multiple values of similarity among the items. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Nowadays, geographical coordinates (geo-tags), social annotations (tags), and low-level features are available in large image datasets. In our paper, we exploit these three kinds of image descriptions to suggest possible annotations for new images uploaded to a social tagging system. In order to compare the benefits each of these description types brings to a tag recommender system on its own, we investigate them independently of each other. First, the existing data collection is clustered separately for the geographical coordinates, tags, and low-level features. Additionally, random clustering is performed in order to provide a baseline for experimental results. Once a new image has been uploaded to the system, it is assigned to one of the clusters using either its geographical or low-level representation. Finally, the most representative tags for the resulting cluster are suggested to the user for annotation of the new image. Large-scale experiments performed for more than 400,000 images compare the different image representation techniques in terms of precision and recall in tag recommendation. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe a semantic imitation model of social tagging that integrates formal representations of semantics and a stochastic tag choice process to explain and predict emergent behavioral patterns. The model adopts a probabilistic topic model to separately represent external word-topic and internal word-concept relations. These representations are coupled with a tag-based topic inference process that predicts how existing tags may influence the semantic interpretation of a document. The inferred topics influence the choice of tags assigned to a document through a random utility model of tag choices. We show that the model is successful in explaining the stability in tag proportions across time and power-law frequency-rank distributions of tag co-occurrences for semantically general and narrow tags. The model also generates novel predictions on how emergent behavioral patterns may change when users with different domain expertise interact with a social tagging system. The model demonstrates the weaknesses of single-level analyses and highlights the importance of adopting a multi-level modeling approach to explain online social behavior. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Tagging is one of the most popular services in Web 2.0. As a special form of tagging, social tagging is done collaboratively by many users, which forms a so-called folksonomy. As tagging has become widespread on the Web, the tag vocabulary is now very informal, uncontrolled, and personalized. For this reason, many tags are unfamiliar and ambiguous to users so that they fail to understand the meaning of each tag. In this paper, we propose a tag sense disambiguating method, called Tag Sense Disambiguation (TSD), which works in the social tagging environment. TSD can be applied to the vocabulary of social tags, thereby enabling users to understand the meaning of each tag through Wikipedia. To find the correct mappings from del.icio.us tags to Wikipedia articles, we define the Local )eighbor tags, the Global )eighbor tags, and finally the )eighbor tags that would be the useful keywords for disambiguating the sense of each tag based on the tag co-occurrences. The automatically built mappings are reasonable in most cases. The experiment shows that TSD can find the correct mappings with high accuracy. © 2009 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose and explore two probabilistic generative models of the social annotation (or tagging) process with an emphasis on user participation. These models leverage the inherent social communities implicit in these tagging services.

There have been conflicting opinions about the quality of user-contributed tags but the issue has not been systematically studied. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose a preliminary methodology for assessing tag quality. The methodology identifies three aspects of tag quality in a social tagging system: Individual tags, collections of tags, and the association of the tags with the corresponding resources. The proposed methodology is being empirically evaluated using the tags of several social tagging systems. In addition to validating and refining the tag quality assessment methodology, the empirical analysis is expected to provide new findings about various properties of the tags. These findings will be used to improve the design of tagging systems by incorporating mechanisms that induce the contribution of high quality tags.},

abstract={Social tagging systems allow collaborative users to annotate shared resources with tags. Since they rely on user-contributed content, social tagging systems are vulnerable to spam annotations, which are generated by malicious users to mislead or confuse legitimate users. Thus, mechanisms for spam detection need to be developed to combat the flexible strategies of spammers for the success of social tagging systems. Since annotations are lack of relevant feature, the classical method of training classifier to detect spam is hard to implement. However, with their collaborative nature, knowledge on the tagging scheme do exists in the way numerous participants annotating resources with tags. In this paper, we propose a simple but remarkably effective approach for detecting tag spam in social tagging systems with collaborative knowledge. We harness the wisdom of crowds to discover the knowledge on what should be high quality annotations for resources. This knowledge is then used to tell spam posts from the legitimate ones. A distinct feature of our approach is that, it can be easily extended for user level spam detection and can do well in both levels. The proposed approach is evaluated on data set collected from real-world system. Experimental results show a convincing performance of proposed approach. © 2009 IEEE.},

Initial term similarities are computed using user and tag information of the resource. The query results are then organized as a group of concepts represented by a few semantically related terms. The resources that are related with each concept are rank with respect to the concept. In addition, concepts are also ranked by representing terms and the number of resources associated. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The popularity of social information systems has been driven by their ability to help users manage, organize and share online resources. Though the research exploring the use of tags is relatively new, two things are widely acknowledged in the research community: (a) tags act as a medium for social collaboration, navigation and browsing and (b) an overall stable equilibrium exists among tag patterns due to the social nature of the tagging process. But there is very little agreement on what causes these stable patterns. In this paper, we take an evolutionary perspective to understand the process of tagging to investigate whether tags act as "way finders" or digital pheromones in social tagging systems. We investigate the existence of tag trails based on a semantic similarity measure among existing tags. We found that over 50% of the resources we evaluated exhibited strong trail patterns. The implications of these patterns for the design and management of social tagging systems is discussed. © 2009 Springer.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have recently emerged as an effective way for users to annotate and organize large collections of resources on the Web. Moreover, they also facilitate an efficient sharing of vast amounts of resources among different users. In this paper, we analyze tags' usage pattern in real world data sets and find that among tags representing the same concept, some tags are less popular, resulting in reduced exploring effectiveness in the current social tagging systems. Another limitation is that users cannot roll-up or drill-down the concept hierarchy of tag queries, resulting in the limited scope of service and a failure to meet users' dynamic information needs which often change with the current information provided. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel three-phase approach as the following: (1) finding semantically-related tags for tag query; (2) constructing clusters of tags representing the same concept; and (3) building hierarchical relationships among clusters of tags. Based on our approaches, horizontal and hierarchical exploration can be implemented. Experiments employing real world dataset show encouraging results and confirm that the proposed approaches are very effective. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Social tagging systems which allow users to create, edit and share collections of internet resources associated with tags in a collaborative fashion are growing in popularity in recent years. The rapidly growing amount of shared data in these folksonomies, i.e., taxonomies created by the folk, presents new technical challenges involved with discovering resources which are likely of interest to the user. Social tags which reflect the meaning of resources from the user's points of view provide an opportunity to enhance the quality of retrieval. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to search relevant resources to the user query by incorporating information obtained from folksonomies' underlying data structures consisting of a set of user/tag/resource triplets. In contrast to traditional retrieval and recommendation techniques which represent a collection by a matrix, we represent our data as a third-order tensor on which a novel Cube Latent Semantic Indexing (CubeLSI) technique is proposed to capture latent semantic associations between tags. With the latent semantic representation we show how to rank relevant resources according to their relevance to user queries. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on the deli.cio.us dataset. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging systems provide users with the ability to share information and extend their field of knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to explore the tag relations of user interest in these systems and examine the semantic relations of tag usage in terms of user interests. To do this, a classifying method was used to characterize words into seven classes. Experiments were limited to the Ave areas of interests: music, photography, games, books and videos. Samples were taken from 50 English-language web pages in the social bookmarking service Delicious. The top 7 tags were extracted from each web page that was tagged as music, photography, games, books and videos. Via the results of the tag analysis of this study, relationship between tags and user interests were demonstrated. TagReel employed a radial visualization method, which has the advantage of giving an overview of the whole cluster of connection among tags. TagReel can represent the semantic concept of connection between tags and between interests. It can contribute to raising the cognitive power and awareness of tag usage in various categories and show the relative weight of tags. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Social bookmarking systems and their emergent information structures, known as folksonomies, are increasingly important data sources for Semantic Web applications. A key question for harvesting semantics from these systems is how to extend and adapt traditional notions of similarity to folksonomies, and which measures are best suited for applications such as navigation support, semantic search, and ontology learning. Here we build an evaluation framework to compare various general folksonomy-based similarity measures derived from established information-theoretic, statistical, and practical measures. Our framework deals generally and symmetrically with users, tags, and resources. For evaluation purposes we focuson similarity among tags and resources, considering different ways to aggregate annotations across users. After comparing how tag similarity measures predict user-created tag relations, we provide an external grounding by user-validated semantic proxies based on WordNet and the Open Directory. We also investigate the issue of scalability. We find that mutual information with distributional micro-aggregation across users yields the highest accuracy, but is not scalable; per-user projection with collaborative aggregation provides the best scalable approach via incremental computations. The results are consistent across resource and tag similarity. Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr have achieved great success. This chapter is concerned with the problem of social tagging analysis and mining. More specifically, we discuss five properties of social tagging and their applications: 1) keyword property, which means social annotations serve as human selected keywords for Web resources; 2) semantic property, which indicates semantic relations among tags and Web resources; 3) hierarchical property, which means that hierarchical structure can be derived from the flat social tagging space; 4) quality property, which means that Web resources' qualities are varied and can be quantified using social tagging; 5) distribution property, which indicates the distribution of frequencies of social tags usually converges to a power-law distribution. These properties are the most principle characteristics, which have been popularly discussed and explored in many applications. As a case study, we show how to improve the social resource browsing by applying the five properties of social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={Social tagging is an increasingly popular phenomenon with substantial impact on Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Tags express the personal perspectives of the user on the music items (such as songs, artists, or albums) they tagged. These personal perspectives should be taken into account in MIR tasks that assess the similarity between music items. In this paper, we propose an novel approach for clustering music items represented in social tagging systems. Its characteristic is that it determines similarity between items by preserving the 3-way relationships among the inherent dimensions of the data, i.e., users, items, and tags. Conversely to existing approaches that use reductions to 2- way relationships (between items-users or items-tags), this characteristic allows the proposed algorithm to consider the personal perspectives of tags and to improve the clustering quality. Due to the complexity of social tagging data, we focus on spectral clustering that has been proven effective in addressing complex data. However, existing spectral clustering algorithms work with 2-way relationships. To overcome this problem, we develop a novel data-modeling scheme and a tag-aware spectral clustering procedure that uses tensors (high-dimensional arrays) to store the multigraph structures that capture the personalised aspects of similarity. Experimental results with data from Last.fm indicate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of clustering quality over conventional spectral clustering approaches that consider only 2-way relationships. © 2009 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={Social tagging to annotate resources represents one of the innovative aspects introduced with Web 2.0 and the new challenges of the (semantic) Web 3.0. Social tagging, also known as user-generated keywords or folksonomies, implies that keywords, from an arbitrarily large and uncontrolled vocabulary, are used by a large community of readers to describe resources. Despite undeniable success and usefulness of social tagging systems, they also suffer from some drawbacks: the proliferation of social tags, coming as they are from an unrestricted vocabulary leads to ambiguity when determining their intended meaning; the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata leads to confusions as to their roles and justification; and the flatness of the structure of the keywords and lack of relationships among them imply difficulties in relating different keywords when they describe the same or similar concepts. So in order to increase precision, in the searches and classifications made possible by folksonomies, some experiences and results from formal classification and subjecting systems are considered, in order to help solve, if not to prevent altogether, the ambiguities that are intrinsic in such systems. Some successful and not so successful approaches as proposed in the scientific literature are discussed, and a few more are introduced here to further help dealing with special cases. In particular, we believe that adding depth and structure to the terms used in folksonomies could help in word sense disambiguation, as well as correctly identifying and classifying proper names, metaphors, and slang words when used as social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

In this paper, we propose a two-level learning hierarchy of a concept based keyword extraction method to filter the candidate tags and rank them based on their occurrences in concepts existing in the given resources. Incorporating user-created tags to extract the hidden concept-document relationships distinguishes the two-level from the one-level learning version, which extracts concepts directly using terms existing in textual contents. Our experiment shows that a multi-concept approach, which considers more than one concept for each resource, improves the performance of a single-concept approach, which takes into account just the most relevant concept. Moreover, the experiments also prove that the proposed two-level learning hierarchy gives better performances than one of the one-level version.},

abstract={In order to exploit usage and attention metadata, one needs to define what properties of usage to use and why, second, how to gather data on that property, and third, what to do with that information. In this paper, we propose to consider usage and attention metadata as an example of the wider notion of context and give an overview of dimensions of context that are relevant in technology enhanced learning (TEL). We consider the intersection of the areas of digital learning resource repositories, digital libraries, and other Web environments including social tagging systems. Specifically, we argue that context comprises the usage situation and environment as well as persistent and transient properties of the user. Therefore, we distinguish between the macro-context and the micro-context of TEL. We further subdivide the latter into user models, material/environment models, interaction models, and background knowledge, showing that usage and attention metadata are of different types and play different roles for learning about context. We then concentrate on teachers using learning-resource repositories as an important use-case example of TEL and focus on language and country as context variables. We describe different ways in which these variables can be measured, i.e., ways of operationalising the construct and data gathering to provide values for the variable. Finally, we outline how TEL can use such context information to improve the use and reuse of repositories by making them more useful in a multilingual and multicultural context. A key theme of our article is the central role that social tagging can play in this process: on the one hand, tags describe usage, attention, and other aspects of context; on the other hand, they can help to exploit context data towards making repositories more useful, and thus enhance the reuse.},

abstract={Social tagging is the process of assigning and sharing among users freely selected terms of resources. This approach enables users to annotate/describe resources, and also allows users to locate new resources through the collective intelligence of other users. Social tagging offers a new avenue for resource discovery as compared to taxonomies and subject directories created by experts. This chapter investigates the effectiveness of tags as resource descriptors and is achieved using text categorization via support vector machines (SVM). Two text categorization experiments were done for this research, and tags and Web pages from del.icio.us were used. The first study concentrated on the use of terms as its features while the second used both terms and its tags as part of its feature set. The experiments yielded a macroaveraged precision, recall, and F-measure scores of 52.66%, 54.86%, and 52.05%, respectively. In terms of microaveraged values, the experiments obtained 64.76% for precision, 54.40% for recall, and 59.14% for F-measure. The results suggest that the tags were not always reliable indicators of the resource contents. At the same time, the results from the terms-only experiment were better compared to the experiment with both terms and tags. Implications of our work and opportunities for future work are also discussed. © 2009, IGI Global.},

abstract={Nowadays the popularity of tag clouds in websites is increased notably, but its generation is criticized because its lack of control causes it to be more likely to produce inconsistent and redundant results. It is well known that if tags are freely chosen (instead of taken from a given set of terms), synonyms (multiple tags for the same meaning), normalization of words and even, heterogeneity of users are likely to arise, lowering the efficiency of content indexing and searching contents. To solve this problem, we have designed the Maximum Similarity Measure (MaSiMe) a dynamic and flexible similarity measure that is able to take into account and optimize several considerations of the user who wishes to obtain a free-of-redundancies tag cloud. Moreover, we include an algorithm to effectively compute the measure and a parametric study to determine the best configuration for this algorithm. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Tags in social tagging systems store meaning for the taggers who have entered them, and other users often share this understanding. The result of this, a folksonomy, is typically used in several ways, including information retrieval and clustering, serendipitous information access, or visualization of folksonomic characteristics. For these uses tags work pretty well; however, the ambiguity of tags makes it difficult to use them for more than searching and browsing. This paper introduces examples of current programmatic support in the form of mashups and highlights its shortcomings. It identifies several types of tags based on their structure and language, and discusses how these types support programmatic uses. The main part is the presentation of the ActiveTags system, a browser extension with supporting server infrastructure. Using it the same community process that creates a folksonomy can be used to enhance tags with programmatic meaning. Users are enabled to create reliable mashups based on tags. Effectively, this leads to customized views of Web pages with tagged content. ActiveTags naturally increases the usability of social tagging systems and further extends the notion of user-generated content. © 2009, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

We studied 23 people's use of MobiTags in a local museum, combining interview data with device use logs and tracking of people's movements to understand how MobiTags affected their navigation and experience in the museum. Despite a lack of social cues, people feel a strong sense of social presence-and social pressure-through seeing others' tags. The tight coupling of tags, item information, and map features also supported a rich set of practices around these modes of navigation. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

We propose a novel approach to model-driven software development based on ontologies and Semantic Web technology. Our approach uses three ontologies to define software models: a task ontology, a domain ontology and a top-level ontology. The task ontology serves as the conceptual model for the software, the domain ontology provides domainspecific knowledge and the top-level ontology integrates the task and domain ontologies. Our method allows the verification of these models both for consistency and ontological adequacy. This verification can be performed both at development and runtime. Domain ontologies are replaceable modules, which enables the comparison and application of the models built using our method across multiple domains. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through the design and implementation of a semantic wiki and a social tagging system, and compare it with model-driven software development to illustrate its benefits. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Social tagging provides valuable and crucial information for large-scale web image retrieval. It is ontology-free and easy to obtain; however, irrelevant tags frequently appear, and users typically will not tag all semantic objects in the image, which is also called semantic loss. To avoid noises and compensate for the semantic loss, tag recommendation is proposed in literature. However, current recommendation simply ranks the related tags based on the single modality of tag co-occurrence on the whole dataset, which ignores other modalities, such as visual correlation. This paper proposes a multi-modality recommendation based on both tag and visual correlation, and formulates the tag recommendation as a learning problem. Each modality is used to generate a ranking feature, and Rankboost algorithm is applied to learn an optimal combination of these ranking features from different modalities. Experiments on Flickr data demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning-based multi-modality recommendation strategy.

abstract={The potential advantages of tagging have been addressed in numerous literatures, however still the effectiveness of tagging in information retrieval has not confirmed yet along with continuous intensive debates between advocates of new tagging systems versus traditional controlled vocabulary metadata. Despite all the potential advantages of tagging, the overlapping ratios between tags and the words used in other metadata fields, such as title and description, are significant. In this study, with the data from Youtube.com videos, the degree of overlapping is examined among the fields of title, description and tag, with additional questions about tagging, such as changes in numbers of words in each metadata field over time and the difference between web site promotion videos and non-promotion videos. The findings include 1) the number of words in each metadata fields have increased over time; 2) web site promotional videos have more words in each metadata fields than non-promotional videos; 3) more than 50% of words are shared among metadata fields including the tag field; 4) as much as 25% of the videos have the exactly same words repeated among the metadata fields. More similar studies with data from other social tagging sites are suggested to verify these findings.},

abstract={Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

abstract={Collaborative Tagging is a powerful method to create folksonomies that can be used to grasp/filter user preferences or enhance web search. Recent research has shown that depending on the number of users and the quality of user-provided tags powerful community-driven semantics or "ontologies" can emerge - as it was evident analyzing user data from social web applications such as del.icio.us or Flickr. Unfortunately, most web pages do not contain tags and, thus, no vocabulary that describes the information provided. A common problem in web page annotation is to motivate users for constant participation, i.e. tagging. In this paper we describe our approach of a binary verification game that embeds collaborative tagging into on-line games in order to produce domain specific folksonomies.

abstract={The accelerated news cycle and constantly emerging news-worthy events have led to 'citizen journalism' where people who are non-journalists collect, analyze and disseminate news pieces. This paper seeks to leverage tags drawn from iReport, an active citizen journalism Website to detect major news events. The goal is to examine the coverage and efficacy of news detected in iReport vis-à-vis those reported in the mainstream media. The data collection procedure involved manually culling major news events reported in Fox News between April 8 2008 and June 6 2008. Additionally, 81,815 tags from 15,216 documents were drawn from iReport during the same study period. Relative frequencies of all unique tags were used to check for spikes and bursts in the dataset. The results show that out of the 10 major news events reported in Fox News, five could be detected in iReport. This paper concludes by presenting the main findings, limitations and suggestions for future research. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

We analyzed nine different systems that extend social bookmarking in the direction of more semantics; i.e. that enable their users to add semantics to the folksonomy. We studied the systems regarding the realization of the social semantic bookmarking paradigm, the features offered to the users to add semantics, what kind of semantics can be added, and how the system makes use of the semantics. We will present commonalities, main differences and distinctive features, and future trends.},

We then propose a measure for the popularity of a location in a city. The analysis of the data set reveals that the popularity follows a power law with very few highly popular locations and a long tail of places in a city that are visited only occasionally. The most popular locations can be identified with the semantic core of the conceptualization of the city in terms of images. This raises the issue of individual differences. We propose another measure that permits to identify users with similar conceptualizations of a city. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Both search engine click-through log and social annotation have been utilized as user feedback for search result re-ranking. However, to our best knowledge, no previous study has explored the correlation between these two factors for the task of search result re-ranking. In this paper, we show that the gap between search queries and social tags of the same web page can well reflect its user preference score. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel algorithm, called Query-Tag-Gap (QTG), to rerank search results for better user satisfaction. Intuitively, on one hand, the search users' intentions are generally described by their queries before they read the search results. On the other hand, the web annotators semantically tag web pages after they read the content of the pages. The difference between users' recognition of the same page before and after they read it is a good reflection of user satisfaction. In this extended abstract, we formally define the query set and tag set of the same page as users' pre- and postknowledge respectively. We empirically show the strong correlation between user satisfaction and user's knowledge gap before and after reading the page. Based on this gap, experiments have shown outstanding performance of our proposed QTG algorithm in search result re-ranking. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

The lack of accuracy is caused by the vocabulary problems and the nature of tagging systems which rely on lower number of index terms for each resource. Tagraph vocabulary system which is based on a weighted directed graph of tags, and Tag Qualifiers, are proposed to mitigate these problems and increase the precision and the recall of social tagging systems. Both solutions are based on community contributions, therefore specific procedures such as task routing should be used to increase the number of contributions and therefore to achieve a more accurate system. © 2009 Springer US.},

abstract={Social tagging systems present a new challenge to the researchers working on recommender systems. The presence of tags, which uncover the reasons of user interests to tagged items, opens a way to increase the quality of recommendations. Yet, there is no common agreement of how the power of tags can be harnessed for recommendation. In this paper we argue for the use of spreading activation approach for building tag-aware recommender systems and suggest a specific version of this approach adapted to the multidimensional nature of social tagging networks. We introduce the asymmetric measure of relevancy (proximity) of two nodes on a multidimensional network as a cumulative strength of (weighted) multiple connections between two nodes, which includes paths and graph-structures connecting the nodes. This metric is also applicable to measure relevancy of two sub-graphs. Spreading activation methods (SAM), which usually employ breadth first search, are an efficient way to define and compute such measure taking into account not only links constituent a path, but the properties of nodes in the path such as node's types and outdegree. We apply this notion of relevancy to measure similarity of collaborative tagging systems users and present the results of numerical simulation showing that spreading activation methods allow us to discriminate between diverse graph-structures connecting users via resources and tags. We show that the results of simulation are stable w.r.t. the variation of parameters of spreading activation algorithm used in our experiment.},

abstract={We studied the dynamic effects of information needs and social influence of tags in an exploratory search task. Although initially differences in information needs led to diversity in tag choices, this diversity disappeared as participants collaboratively tagged the same set of resources. Our findings are in general consistent with the notion that people conform to the collective interpretation of contents in an information system. In addition, our results showed that conformity does not only arise out of imitation of behavior, but also from the same underlying semantic interpretation or knowledge structures of users as they engage in informal collaboration through the social tagging system. Implications for design of social information system are discussed. © 2009 Springer.},

abstract={In this paper we present a newly designed annotation and collaboration component, which has been prototypically implemented on top of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. Standard ERP software is often described as being inflexible in respect to personal needs of a single user or a user group. To cope with this problem, theories, and principles from classical CSCW research and design were combined with recent developments in Social Software and what is now often summarized as Web 2.0. Our component is inspired by Web 2.0 principles like user generated content, information sharing, and harnessing network effects. As the central paradigm we applied social tagging based on folksonomies as e.g. used in del.ico.us, Flickr, and YouTube. In addition best practices from research on online community building were used to design a social annotating component for ERP systems. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social media sharing web sites like Flickr allow users to annotate images with free tags, which significantly facilitate Web image search and organization. However, the tags associated with an image generally are in a random order without any importance or relevance information, which limits the effectiveness of these tags in search and other applications. In this paper, we propose a tag ranking scheme, aiming to automatically rank the tags associated with a given image according to their relevance to the image content. We first estimate initial relevance scores for the tags based on probability density estimation, and then perform a random walk over a tag similarity graph to refine the relevance scores. Experimental results on a 50, 000 Flickr photo collection show that the proposed tag ranking method is both effective and efficient. We also apply tag ranking into three applications: (1) tag-based image search, (2) tag recommendation, and (3) group recommendation, which demonstrates that the proposed tag ranking approach really boosts the performances of social-tagging related applications.

abstract={Today, service delivery organizations operate in a highly dynamic, complex, competitive, and globally distributed environment. There is constant pressure to reduce costs and improve performance and quality. Success demands the ability to continuously learn and adapt. Standardization is recognized as essential to reducing variation and, therefore, costs, as well as managing quality. Public frameworks and standards, such as ITIL® (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), provide best-practice guidance and a common vocabulary for managing IT (information technology) services. In this paper, we explore the role that social networking and "crowdsourcing" can play in socializing and developing best practices for a service delivery organization. We draw on our experience developing and deploying a social networking application, called Cyano, which is being used by approximately 13,000 IT professionals to capture and maintain day-to-day activities, processes, and artifacts used for problem and change management of several hundred outsourced infrastructures. Cyano is a new breed of social networking enterprise applications, in which crowdsourcing is leveraged to enrich and maintain IT processes and social networks are not created by explicit membership, but rather are implicitly discovered by the type of activities and infrastructure elements that various users support. In this paper, we focus on 1) the architecture of Cyano for supporting social tagging and linkage across different layers of management applications, 2) process customization and governance, and 3) an automated recommendation system that has been well received by thousands of IT professionals. We also highlight research challenges in this space. © 2009 IBM.},

abstract={The paper describes how Harvard Business School's Knowledge and Library Services (KLS) leveraged the collective knowledge of its employees in formulating, implementing, and evaluating strategy. The organisation was faced with major, disruptive changes in its environment and needed the diverse knowledge and full engagement of all employees to make a series of strategic shifts. The shifts included integrating KLS products and services with the Harvard Business School research and course development process, developing global scope in information resources and expertise, and trading its role as the guardian of books and buildings for the organiser of the School's priority information assets. In order to achieve that, KLS launched the Environmental Scan Program, relying on employees' insights aggregated through social tagging, trend analysis and internal prediction markets tracking emerging trends. KLS also created processes for the collective assessment of strategy and a faster way of turning ideas into new products and services. The paper concludes with an assessment of the approach, pointing to a difficult balance between emergent and collective dimensions of strategy process with its formal, structured facets. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

abstract={Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, against the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content (UGC) have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of UGC that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this chapter, we intend to investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests for a recommender system. In order to achieve that goal, folksonomies have been included into ITR (ITem Recommender), a content-based recommender system developed at the University of Bari [7]. Specifically, static content consisting of the descriptions of the items in a collection have been enriched with dynamic UGC through social tagging techniques. The new recommender system, called FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), extends the original ITR system integrating UGC management by letting users to express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as to annotate rated items with free tags. The main contribution of the chapter is an integrated strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques, both on official item descriptions provided by a publisher and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests, often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the domain of cultural heritage personalization. Experiments involving 40 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The amount of information available on the world wide web keeps growing at an exponential pace. Social tagging is a feature of various online social networks to organize information elements by letting people label these with free-form text, called tags. The graph created by this process is often called a folksonomy and comprises the association between people, tags and documents. Tagging is now used to organize web pages, pictures, videos, music, books, academic publications, etc. The current ways of navigating folksonomies are limited. In most web portals, "search" is the main feature which uses tags. When browsing tags, most systems give a few related tags to the clicked tag, none enables the user to get related tags to multiple clicked tags at the same time. A popular tag cloud displays links to the most popular tags in the folksonomy with a font size that depends on their popularity. Popular tag clouds and related tags can enable tag-based navigation. Enabling navigation through related tag clouds to multiple clicked tags in an efficient and scalable manner is a hard problem. We propose a bayesian approach to the problem of generating related tag clouds for navigation by using social network information and probabilistic models of people's tagging behaviors. We propose two new models to generate tag clouds based on popularity, tag co-occurrence and social relationships. The models are implemented in a prototype application to navigate empirical data from "last.fm", an online social network for music. We give an evaluation plan to compare the models regarding searchability through user evaluations. © 2009 ACM.},

abstract={The EnTag (Enhanced Tagging for Discovery) project investigated the effect on indexing and retrieval when using only social tagging versus when using social tagging in combination with suggestions from a controlled vocabulary. Two different contexts were explored: tagging by readers of a digital collection and tagging by authors in an institutional repository; also two different controlled vocabularies were examined, Dewey Decimal Classification and ACM Computing Classification Scheme. For each context a separate demonstrator was developed and a user study conducted. The results showed the importance of controlled vocabulary suggestions for both indexing and retrieval: to help produce ideas of tags to use, to make it easier to find focus for the tagging, as well as to ensure consistency and increase the number of access points in retrieval. The value and usefulness of the suggestions proved to be dependent on the quality of the suggestions, both in terms of conceptual relevance to the user and in appropriateness of the terminology. The participants themselves could also see the advantages of controlled vocabulary terms for retrieval if the terms used were from an authoritative source. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

This discussion emerges from attempts to extend previous work on Information Foraging Theory [1] to address these new trends in online information-seeking and sensemaking. Information Foraging Theory is a theory of human-information interaction that aims to explain and predict how people will best shape themselves to their information environments, and how information environments can best be shaped to people. The theory has mainly focused on information seeking by the solitary user, but as the Internet and Web have evolved, so too must the theory, and so I will discuss recent studies of sensemaking and the social production, sharing, and use of information in areas such as wikis, social tagging, social network sites, and social search. The opportunity (and challenges) are enormous for developing a scientific foundation to support online groups and communities that are engaged in creating, organizing, and sharing the knowledge produced through social sensemaking. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social networking sites like Flickr1, Youtube2 and Del.icio.us3 have been rapidly gaining popularity on the Internet, underscoring a transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. With this process, social tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. Folksonomy are data created in social tagging. Tags in folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition on information. They can reveal both the users' behavior and resources' properties. In this paper, we will study the vocabulary of users' tagging and the relationship between words. We connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a network of folksonomy, and investigate the semantic relatedness between tags within it. The result shows that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness, which is useful for designing future folksonomy-based systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper studies web object classification problem with the novel exploration of social tags. Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental preprocess for indexing, browsing, searching, and mining these objects. The explosive growth of heterogeneous web objects, especially non-textual objects such as products, pictures, and videos, has made the problem of web classification increasingly challenging. Such objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable features with semantic information, interconnections between each other, as well as training examples with category labels. In this paper, we explore the social tagging data to bridge this gap. We cast web object classification problem as an optimization problem on a graph of objects and tags. We then propose an efficient algorithm which not only utilizes social tags as enriched semantic features for the objects, but also infers the categories of unlabeled objects from both homogeneous and heterogeneous labeled objects, through the implicit connection of social tags. Experiment results show that the exploration of social tags effectively boosts web object classification. Our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art of general classification methods. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={A corporate portal supports a community of users on cohesively managing a shared set of resources. Such management should also include social tagging, i.e. the practice of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize content. This task involves to know both what to tag (hence, the rendering of the resource content) and how to tag (i.e. the tagging functionality itself). Traditionally both efforts are accomplished by the same application (Flickr is a case in point). However, portals decouple these endeavours. Tagging functionality is up to the portal, but content rendering can be outsourced to third-party applications: the portlets. Portlets are Web applications that transparently render their markup through a portal. The portal is a mere conduit for the portlet markup, being unaware of what this markup conveys. This work addresses how to make portlets tagging-aware, i.e. portlets that can be seamlessly plugged into the portal tagging infrastructure. The main challenge rests on consistency at both the back-end (i.e. use of a common structure for tagging data, e.g. a common set of tags), and the front-end (i.e. tagging interactions to be achieved seamlessly across the portal using similar rendering guidelines). Portlet events and RDFa annotations are used to meet this requirement. A running example in WebSynergy illustrates the feasibility of the approach. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Basic content-based personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution has changed the game for personalization, from 'elitary' Web 1.0, written by few and read by many, to web content generated by everyone (user-generated content - UGC), since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of UGC that has drawn most attention of the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem) is a content-based recommender system developed at the University of Bari which integrates UGC (through social tagging) in a classic content-based model, letting users express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as to annotate rated items with free tags. FIRSt is capable of providing recommendations for items in several domains (e.g., movies, music, books), provided that descriptions of items are available as text documents (e.g. plot summaries, reviews, short abstracts). This paper describes the system general architecture and user modeling approach, showing how this recommendation model has been applied to recommend the artworks located at the Vatican Picture Gallery (Pinacoteca Vaticana), providing users with a personalized museum tour tailored on their tastes. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social image analysis and retrieval is important for helping people organize and access the increasing amount of user-tagged multimedia. Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications. © 2006 IEEE.},

In this paper, we proposed a novel method based on analysis of dynamic user behavior data for the notion that users' behaviors in social tagging system can reflect the quality of tags more accurately. Through modeling the different categories of participants' behaviors, we extract tag-associated actions which can be used to estimate whether tag is spam, and then present our algorithm that can filter the tag spam in the results of social search.

This paper describes a novel application based on an extended tagging concept that can improve resource management and recommendation.

abstract={Web-base tagging systems, which include social bookmarking systems such as del.icio.us, have become increasingly popular. These systems allow participants to annotate or tag web resources. This paper examined the use of social annotations to improve the quality of web search. It involved two components. First, social annotations were used to index resources. Two annotation-based indexing methods were proposed. Second, social annotations were used to improve search result ranking. Four annotation-based ranking methods were proposed. The result showed that using only annotation as an index of resources may not be appropriate. Since social annotations could be viewed as a high level concept of the content, combining them to the content of resource could add some more important concepts to the resources. The result also suggested that both static feature and similarity feature should be considered when using social annotations to re-rank search result. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={A longstanding area of study in indexing is the identification of factors affecting vocabulary usage and consistency. This topic has seen a recent resurgence with a focus on social tagging. Tagging data for scholarly articles made available by the social bookmarking Website CiteULike (www.citeulike.org) were used to test the use of inter-indexer/tagger consistency density values, based on a method developed by the authors by comparing calculations for highly tagged documents representing three subject areas (Science, Social Science, Social Software). The analysis revealed that the developed method is viable for a large dataset. The findings also indicated that there were no significant differences in tagging consistency among the three topic areas, demonstrating that vocabulary usage in a relatively new subject area like social software is no more inconsistent than the more established subject areas investigated. The implications of the method used and the findings are discussed. ©2009 ASIS&T.},

Besides being an Internet phenomenon, social tagging can help organizations manage their intranet document repositories. The structural knowledge embedded in tags is flat, shallow, and often ambiguous however. We develop a theoretical model to argue for potential benefits of sharing deeper structural knowledge in an electronic document repository through personal document hierarchies. Based on the theoretical model, we design a "social hierarchies" system.

abstract={Rather than a document that is being constantly re-written as in the wiki approach, the Living Document (LD) is one that acts as a document router, operating by means of structured and organized social tagging and existing ontologies. It offers an environment where users can manage papers and related information, share their knowledge with their peers and discover hidden associations among the shared knowledge. The LD builds upon both the Semantic Web, which values the integration of well-structured data, and the Social Web, which aims to facilitate interaction amongst people by means of user-generated content. In this vein, the LD is similar to a social networking system, with users as central nodes in the network, with the difference that interaction is focused on papers rather than people. Papers, with their ability to represent research interests, expertise, affiliations, and links to web based tools and databanks, represent a central axis for interaction amongst users. To begin to show the potential of this vision, we have implemented a novel web prototype that enables researchers to accomplish three activities central to the Semantic Web vision: organizing, sharing and discovering.

abstract={Background: Academic social tagging systems, such as Connotea and CiteULike, provide researchers with a means to organize personal collections of online references with keywords (tags) and to share these collections with others. One of the side-effects of the operation of these systems is the generation of large, publicly accessible metadata repositories describing the resources in the collections. In light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable new resource for application developers. Here we characterize the current contents of two scientifically relevant metadata repositories created through social tagging. This investigation helps to establish how such socially constructed metadata might be used as it stands currently and to suggest ways that new social tagging systems might be designed that would yield better aggregate products. Results: We assessed the metadata that users of CiteULike and Connotea associated with citations in PubMed with the following metrics: coverage of the document space, density of metadata (tags) per document, rates of inter-annotator agreement, and rates of agreement with MeSH indexing. CiteULike and Connotea were very similar on all of the measurements. In comparison to PubMed, document coverage and per-document metadata density were much lower for the social tagging systems. Inter-annotator agreement within the social tagging systems and the agreement between the aggregated social tagging metadata and MeSH indexing was low though the latter could be increased through voting. Conclusion: The most promising uses of metadata from current academic social tagging repositories will be those that find ways to utilize the novel relationships between users, tags, and documents exposed through these systems. For more traditional kinds of indexing-based applications (such as keyword-based search) to benefit substantially from socially generated metadata in the life sciences, more documents need to be tagged and more tags are needed for each document. These issues may be addressed both by finding ways to attract more users to current systems and by creating new user interfaces that encourage more collectively useful individual tagging behaviour. © 2009 Good et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a comparative and analytical examination of ten social tagging systems' interfaces and their features and functionalities. The specific objective of the study was to examine the ways in which the user interfaces of social tagging systems encourage and provide users with features to assign, explore, browse and make use of tags during their interaction with social tagging sites. Design/methodology/approach - The user interface features and functionalities of ten social tagging sites (six social bookmarking and four social media sharing sites) are examined. A categorisation of tag-related features is developed for analysis. The sites are selected based on such criteria as popularity, variety of site type, and inclusion of tagging features and content type. Findings - The findings of this study show that there is an emerging interface design paradigm with respect to social tagging sites that reflects a particular focus on exploratory search and browsing features and services. Some of the key areas discussed are: user tagging features; exploratory and tag browsing features; and interface layout. Practical implications - The findings of this study of the user interface features of social tagging sites provide a comprehensive picture of the possible and potential features that can be incorporated into new social tagging systems. Based on the evidence found in the examined social tagging interfaces, recommendations are made on the design of tag posting, tag use, tag browsing, tag lists and tag clouds. The design recommendations offer ideas for the development of more sophisticated exploratory and interactive user interfaces for social tagging systems.

abstract={Reading fiction is many people's favorite pastime. There is no denying that one of the needs of human beings is to share what they read and understand other readers' feelings about the books they have read. Recent developments in Web 2.0 technologies characterizing personalized information organization have led to an interest in social tagging behavior of a variety of items, such as books, images, web pages, videos, etc. However, a major issue with this kind of application is that tags are growing in an uncontrolled manner. In fact, it is chaos. Several studies have recognized the existence of affective tags, but there is no user interface designed to separate affective tags from other tags. To address that affective tags are navigation aids for readers, this work gives an account of design of a novel interface for visualization of affective tags at a social cataloging website, LibraryThing.com.},

abstract={This paper introduces the InSight system, which was designed to explore two new concepts in social tagging. In this system, we introduce the concept of community-editable tags, a methodology that allows a community of users to edit, modify and delete tags of each other. The goal is to improve the quality of tags, and to reduce the proliferation of incorrect or incomplete tags often found in social networking systems. We also explore the concept of "micro-tagging," which has begun to appear in web-based applications. In "micro-tagging," the user attaches a tag to a subset of large media, such as a segment in a video or a region of an image. InSight allows users to create and edit video micro-tags. Users can mark specific time intervals within a video, and specific spatial locations within video frames, and these tags can be edited by subsequent users. We also present an empirical study which demonstrates an improvement in factual tag quality when the community of users is allowed to edit and delete each others' tags. These results provide a first step in demonstrating how refining tags would make them more valuable for search.},

abstract={Search facilities are vital for folksonomy (or social tagging mechanism) based systems. Although these systems allow great malleability and adaptability, they also surfer from problems, such as ambiguity in the meaning of tags, flat organisation of tags and some degree of unstabilising factor on consensus about which tags best describe some certain Web resources. It has been argued that folksonomy structure can be enhanced by ontologies; however, as suggested by Hotho et al., a key question remains open: how to exploit the benefits of ontologies without bothering untrained users with its rigidity. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the problem of ambiguity in tagging systems by expanding folksonomy search with ontologies, which are completely transparent to users. Preliminary implementations and evaluations on the efficiency and the usefulness of such expansions are very promising. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

The sites examined in this project are MySpace, Lastfm, Pandora and Allmusic. In addition, the ways in which independent record labels utilise social networking sites for promotion are investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Three groups of participants were surveyed using questionnaires. These groups were music concert attendees, people who responded to online postings to social networking sites, and independent record companies. In addition interviews were held with digital music experts. Findings: The results suggest that respondents use social networking sites for music discovery but are not generally aware of folksonomic approaches to music discovery. When users do use and contribute to the folksonomy, most respondents were found to tag for personal retrieval purposes rather than attempting to aid the retrieval purposes of the population of site users as a whole. The four record labels unanimously agreed that social networking sites are having a major impact on independent music discovery. Digital distribution has a major impact on independent record labels. It facilitates discovery but at the same time digital distribution creates new promotional dilemmas. Originality/value: The project is small scale but the research area is a relatively novel one, and the results are interesting enough to share more generally in the hope that this project will stimulate further research activity in this area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The authors collect users' attentional metadata based on a server-side logging scheme and use this empirical data to answer two hypotheses. Findings – The search-play-annotation ratio is more efficient with social information retrieval strategies, but community browsing alone does not help users to discover more cross-boundary resources. Practical implications – By social tagging and bookmarking resources from a variety of repositories, users create underlying connections between resources that otherwise do not cross-reference, for example, via hyperlinks. This is important for bringing them under the umbrella of SIR methods. Future studies should include testing wider range of SIR methods to leverage these user-made connections between resources that originate from a number of countries and are in a variety of languages. Originality/value – The use of attentional metadata to model the ecology of social search adds value to the actors of learning object economy, e.g. educational institutions, digital libraries and their managers, content providers, policy makers, educators and learners. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={We consider the problem of ranking the popularity of items and suggesting popular items based on user feedback. User feedback is obtained by iteratively presenting a set of suggested items, and users selecting items based on their own preferences either from this suggestion set or from the set of all possible items. The goal is to quickly learn the true popularity ranking of items (unbiased by the made suggestions), and suggest true popular items. The difficulty is that making suggestions to users can reinforce popularity of some items and distort the resulting item ranking. The described problem of ranking and suggesting items arises in diverse applications including search query suggestions and tag suggestions for social tagging systems. We propose and study several algorithms for ranking and suggesting popular items, provide analytical results on their performance, and present numerical results obtained using the inferred popularity of tags from a month-long crawl of a popular social bookmarking service. Our results suggest that lightweight, randomized update rules that require no special configuration parameters provide good performance. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Social Tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can recommend users with common social interest based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a model to capture the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) method. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a baseline user recommendation algorithm with a real data set (BibSonomy), attaining significant improvements. © 2009 International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={This study explored how user-supplied tags can be applied to designing a thesaurus that reflects the unique features of image documents. Tags from the popular image-sharing Web site Flickr were examined in terms of two central components of a thesaurus-selected concepts and their semantic relations-as well as the features of image documents. Shatford's facet category and Rosch et al.'s basic-level theory were adopted for examining concepts to be included in a thesaurus. The results suggested that the best approach to Color and Generic category descriptors is to focus on basic-level terms and to include frequently used superordinate- and subordinate-level terms. In the Abstract category, it was difficult to specify a set of abstract terms that can be used consistently and dominantly, so it was suggested to enhance browsability using hierarchical and associative relations. Study results also indicate a need for greater inclusion of Specific category terms, which were shown to be an important tool in establishing related tags. Regarding semantic relations, the study indicated that in the identification of related terms, it is important that descriptors not be limited only to the category in which a main entry belongs but broadened to include terms from other categories as well. Although future studies are needed to ensure the effectiveness of this user-oriented approach, this study yielded promising results, demonstrating that user-supplied tags can be a helpful tool in selecting concepts to be included in a thesaurus and in identifying semantic relations among the selected concepts. It is hoped that the results of this study will provide a practical guideline for designing a thesaurus for image documents that takes into account both the unique features of these documents and the unique information-seeking behaviors of general users.},

abstract={Purpose - Social tagging systems allow users to assign keywords (tags) to useful resources, facilitating their future access by the tag creator and possibly by other users. Social tagging has both proponents and critics, and this paper aims to investigate if tags are an effective means of resource discovery. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts techniques from text categorisation in which webpages and their associated tags from del.icio.us and trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are downloaded to determine if the documents could be assigned to their associated tags. Two text categorisation experiments were conducted. The first used only the terms from the documents as features while the second experiment included tags in addition to terms as part of its feature set. Performance metrics used were precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score. A content analysis was also conducted to uncover characteristics of effective and ineffective tags for resource discovery. Findings - Results from the classifiers were mixed, and the inclusion of tags as part of the feature set did not result in a statistically significant improvement (or degradation) of the performance of the SVM classifiers. This suggests that not all tags can be used for resource discovery by public users, confirming earlier work that there are many dynamic reasons for tagging documents that may not be apparent to others. Originality/value - The authors extend their understanding of social classification and its utility in sharing and accessing resources. Results of this work may be used to guide development in social tagging systems as well as social tagging practices. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Developers frequently add annotations to source code to help them remember pertinent information and mark locations of interest for future investigation. Finding and refinding these notes is a form of navigation that is integral to software maintenance. Although there is some tool support in modern development environments for authoring and navigating these comments, we have observed that these annotations often fail to remind and are sometimes difficult to find by the programmer. To address these shortcomings, we have designed a new approach for software navigation called Tags for Software Engineering Activities (TagSEA). TagSEA combines the notion of waypointing (a mechanism for marking locations in spatial navigation) with social tagging to support programmers in defining semantically rich annotations to source code comments. The tool provides support for creating, editing, navigating, and managing these annotations. We present the results from two empirical studies, where we observed and then analyzed how professional programmers used source code annotations to support their development activities over 24 months. Our findings indicate that the addition of semantic information to annotations can improve their value. We also provide suggestions on how annotation tools in general may be improved. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the recent web developments has focused on the opportunities it presents for social tagging through user participation and collaboration. As a result, social tagging has changed the traditional online communication process. The interpretation of tagging between humans and machines may create new problems if essential questions about how social tagging corresponds to online communications, what objects the tags refer to, who the interpreters are, and why they are engaged are not explored systematically. Since such reasoning is an interpretation of social tagging among humans, tags and machines, it is a complex issue that calls for deep reflection. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of the potential problems raised by social tagging through the framework of C.S. Peirce's semiotics. We find that general phenomena of social tagging can be well classified by Peirce's 10 classes of signs for reasoning. This suggests that regarding social tagging as a sign and systematically analyzing the interpretation are positively associated with the 10 classes of signs. Peircean semiotics can be used to examine the dynamics and determinants of tagging; hence, the various uses of this categorization schema may have implications for the design and development of information systems and web applications.},

Political blogs can recommend posts to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users. However, a post in politics may be interpreted in a number of ways by different users. This is because terms, especially in politics, carry an ideological burden and therefore it is very likely for posts to present a semantic ambiguity. The significance of this study is that in contrast to current recommendation algorithms, we apply Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) on a 3-dimensional tensor to find latent semantic relationships between the three types of entities that exist in a social blogging system: users, posts, and tags. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Wordpress and Technorati).

abstract={Social tagging is an emerging methodology that allows individual users to assign semantic keywords to content on the web. Popular web services allow the community of users to search for content based on these user-defined tags. Tags are typically attached to a whole entity such as a web page (e.g., del.icio.us), a video (e.g., YouTube), a product description (e.g., Amazon) or a photograph (e.g., Flickr). However, finding specific information within a whole entity can be a difficult, time-intensive process. This is especially true for content such as video, where the information sought may be a small segment within a very long presentation. Moreover, the tags provided by a community of users may be incorrect, conflicting, or incomplete when used as search terms. In this paper we introduce a system that allows users to create "micro-tags," that is, semantic markers that are attached to subsets of information. These micro-tags give the user the ability to direct attention to specific subsets within a larger and more complex entity, and the set of micro-tags provides a more nuanced description of the full content. Also, when these micro-tags are used as search terms, there is no need to do a serial search of the content, since micro-tags draw attention to the semantic content of interest. This system also provides a mechanism that allows users in the community to edit and delete each others' tags, using the community to refine and improve tag quality. We will also report on empirical studies that demonstrate the value of micro-tagging and tag editing and explore the role micro-tags and tag editing will play in future applications. © 2009 SPIE-IS&T.},

abstract={Introduction: We define a collection of metrics for describing and comparing sets of terms in controlled and uncontrolled indexing languages and then show how these metrics can be used to characterize a set of languages spanning folksonomies, ontologies and thesauri. Method: Metrics for term set characterization and comparison were identified and programs for their computation implemented. These programs were then used to identify descriptive features of term sets from twenty-two different indexing languages and to measure the direct overlap between the terms. Analysis. The computed data were analysed using manual and automated techniques including visualization, clustering and factor analysis. Distinct subsets of the metrics were sought that could be used to distinguish between the uncontrolled languages produced by social tagging systems (folksonomies) and the controlled languages produced using professional labour. Results: The metrics proved sufficient to differentiate between instances of different languages and to enable the identification of term-set patterns associated with indexing languages produced by different kinds of information system. In particular, distinct groups of term-set features appear to distinguish folksonomies from the other languages. Conclusions: The metrics organized here and embodied in freely available programs provide an empirical lens useful in beginning to understand the relationships that hold between different, controlled and uncontrolled indexing languages. © the authors, 2009.},

abstract={This article presents an exploratory study of "Blobgects," an experimental interface for an online museum catalog that enables social tagging and blogging activity around a set of cultural heritage objects held by a preeminent museum of anthropology and archaeology. This study attempts to understand not just whether social tagging and commenting about these objects is useful but rather whose tags and voices matter in presenting different "expert" perspectives around digital museum objects. Based on an empirical comparison between two different user groups (Canadian Inuit highschool students and museum studies students in the United States), we found that merely adding the ability to tag and comment to the museum's catalog does not sufficiently allow users to learn about or engage with the objects represented by catalog entries. Rather, the specialist language of the catalog provides too little contextualization for users to enter into the sort of dialog that proponents of Web 2.0 technologies promise. Overall, we propose a more nuanced application of Web 2.0 technologies within museums-one which provides a contextual basis that gives users a starting point for engagement and permits users to make sense of objects in relation to their own needs, uses, and understandings.},

Methods of researching the contribution of social tagging and folksonomy are described, and outstanding research questions are presented. This is a new area of research, where theoretical perspectives and relevant research methods are only now being defined. This paper provides a framework for the study of folksonomy, tagging and social tagging systems. Three broad approaches are identified, focusing first, on the folksonomy itself (and the role of user tags in indexing and retrieval); secondly, on tagging (and the behaviour of users); and thirdly, on the nature of social tagging systems (as socio-technical frameworks).},

abstract={Social bookmarking or tagging is the process of assigning and sharing among users, freely selected terms to resources. This approach is a form of user-generated metadata and allows users to locate new resources through the collective intelligence of other users. Social tagging offers a new avenue for resource discovery as compared to taxonomies and subject directories created by experts. While social tagging has its advantages, one possible drawback is that tag creators, who come with different preferences, experiences, and beliefs, among other factors, may view the same document differently and therefore apply different tags even though they may have the same goal of content organization and sharing. In this paper, we argue that familiarity is an important issue to be investigated in social tagging systems, and our goal is to examine the influence of the level of familiarity with social tagging on the effectiveness of tags for content sharing. We found that high familiarity with the concept of tagging, Web directories, and social tagging systems are significantly and positively associated with high tag effectiveness for content sharing. Implications of our findings and opportunities for future work are discussed.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this article is to provide a quantitative analysis of the extent to which folksonomies replicate the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) to see if folksonomies would successfully complement cataloger-supplied subject headings in library catalogs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper compares social tags and LC subject headings for ten books from various library-related applications including next generation OPACs and LibraryThing by ranking tags and subject headings using scales modified from research by Golder and Huberman, Voorbij, and Kipp. Findings - Social tagging does indeed augment LCSH by providing additional access to resources. Research limitations/implications - Several of our applications lacked tags for the books we chose in our study. Tags are primarily taken from LibraryThing. Practical implications - A hybrid catalog combining both LCSH and a folksonomy would result in richer metadata and be stronger than the sum of its parts, giving patrons the best of both worlds in terms of access to materials. Originality/value - This paper supplies quantitative support for the use of folksonomies in a library's catalog.

Typical personal knowledge management (PKM) systems do not provide effective ways for representing knowledge worker's unstructured knowledge or idea. In order to provide better knowledge activity for them, we implement Wiki-based social Network Thin client (WANT) that is a wiki-based semantic tagging system for collaborative and communicative knowledge creation and maintenance for a knowledge worker. And also, we suggest the social semantic cloud of tags (SCOT) ontology to represent tag data at a semantic level and combine this ontology in WANT. WANT supports a wide scope of social activities through online mash-up services and interlink resources with desktop and web environments. Our approach provides basic functionalities such as creating, organising and searching knowledge at individual level, as well as enhances social connections among knowledge workers based on their activities.

abstract={A lot of texts are associated with Web images, such as image file name, ALT texts, surrounding texts etc on the corresponding Web pages. It is well known that the semantics of Web images are well correlated with these associated texts, and thus they can be used to infer the semantics of Web images. However, different types of associated texts may play different roles in deriving the semantics of Web contents. Most previous work either regard the associated texts as a whole, or assign fixed weights to different types of associated texts according to some prior knowledge or heuristics. In this paper, we propose a novel linear basic expansion-based approach to automatically annotate Web images based on their associated texts. In particular, we adaptively model the semantic contributions of different types of associated texts by using a piecewise penalty weighted regression model. We also demonstrate that we can leverage the social tagging data of Web images, such as the Flickr's Related Tags, to enhance the performance of Web image annotation. Experiments conducted on a real Web image data set demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the performance of Web image annotation. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The development and verification of software models that are applicable across multiple domains remains a difficult problem. We propose a novel approach to model-driven software development based on ontologies and Semantic Web technology. Our approach uses three ontologies to define software models: a task ontology, a domain ontology and a top-level ontology. The task ontology serves as the conceptual model for the software, the domain ontology provides domain-specific knowledge and the top-level ontology integrates the task and domain ontologies. Our method allows the verification of these models both for consistency and ontological adequacy. This verification can be performed both at development and runtime. Domain ontologies are replaceable modules, which enables the comparison and application of the models built using our method across multiple domains. We demonstrate the viability of our approach through the design and implementation of a semantic wiki and a social tagging system, and compare it with model-driven software development to illustrate its benefits. © 2009 IOS Press.

The grouping metaphor is intuitive and easy for the users, and our evaluation shows that users appreciate the grouping facility, and use this feature to organize and structure diverse Web content. Technically, the grouping of resources carries valuable information about Web resources and their relations. GroupMe! exploits such information to improve search and retrieval.

abstract={This paper presents an in-depth study of the social tagging mechanisms used in Freesound.org, an online community where users share and browse audio files by means of tags and content-based audio similarity search. We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

This upsurge of user-generated data involves a paradigm shift in terms of the management, searching and accessing of information. Social tagging is one of these ways. This paper serves as an extension to the existing work done on investigating the effectiveness of tags for content discovery using text categorization techniques. In particular, we explored how different tag weighting schemes affect classifier performance. Six text categorization experiments were conducted using a dataset drawn from del.icio.us. The results suggest that not all tags are useful for content discovery even with different weights associated with them. Content analysis was done to understand the relationships between the use of a tag on a document and the document's terms.

abstract={Collaborative, social tagging and annotation systems have exploded on the Internet as part of the Web 2.0 phenomenon. Systems such as Flickr, Del.icio.us, Technorati, Connotea and LibraryThing, provide a community-driven approach to classifying information and resources on the Web, so that they can be browsed, discovered and re-used. Although social tagging sites provide simple, user-relevant tags, there are issues associated with the quality of the metadata and the scalability compared with conventional indexing systems. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that enables authoritative metadata generated by traditional cataloguing methods to be merged with community annotations and tags. The HarvANA (Harvesting and Aggregating Networked Annotations) system uses a standardized but extensible RDF model for representing the annotations/tags and OAI-PMH to harvest the annotations/tags from distributed community servers. The harvested annotations are aggregated with the authoritative metadata in a centralized metadata store. This streamlined, interoperable, scalable approach enables libraries, archives and repositories to leverage community enthusiasm for tagging and annotation, augment their metadata and enhance their discovery services. This paper describes the HarvANA system and its evaluation through a collaborative testbed with the National Library of Australia using architectural images from PictureAustralia.

Observed patterns of concept reference as a function of sequence position hint at dynamic properties of the tag production process by marking a trace of cognitive activity. If tagging is object categorization, these measures provide a view of the personal categorization behavior of non-professionals and illuminate biases in the production of 'folksonomies' due to tag production processes.},

abstract={Online communities have become popular for publishing and searching content, as well as for finding and connecting to other users. User-generated content includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. These items can be annotated and rated by different users, and these social tags and derived user-specific scores can be leveraged for searching relevant content and discovering subjectively interesting items. Moreover, the relationships among users can also be taken into consideration for ranking search. results, the intuition being that you trust the recommendations of your close friends more than those of your casual, acquaintances. Queries for tag or keyword combinations that compute and rank the top-k results thus face a large variety of options that complicate the query processing and pose efficiency challenges. This paper addresses these issues by developing an incremental top-k algorithm with two-dimensional expansions: social expansion considers the strength, of relations among users, and semantic expansion considers the relatedness of different tags. It presents a new algorithm, based on principles of threshold algorithms, by folding friends and related tags into the search space in an incremental on-demand manner. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets, crawled from deli.cio.us, Flickr, and LibraryThing. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={The growing popularity of social tagging systems promises to alleviate the knowledge bottleneck that slows down the full materialization of the Semantic Web since these systems allow ordinary users to create and share knowledge in a simple, cheap, and scalable representation, usually known as folksonomy. However, for the sake of knowledge workflow, one needs to find a compromise between the uncontrolled nature of folksonomies and the controlled and more systematic vocabulary of domain experts. In this paper we propose to address this concern by devising a method that automatically enriches a folksonomy with domain expert knowledge and by introducing a novel algorithm based on frequent itemset mining techniques to efficiently learn an ontology over the enriched folksonomy. In order to quantitatively assess our method, we propose a new benchmark for task-based ontology evaluation where the quality of the ontologies is measured based on how helpful they are for the task of personalized information finding. We conduct experiments on real data and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

We show that information theory provides a natural and interesting way to understand this efficiency - or the descriptive, encoding power of tags. Our results indicate the efficiency of tags appears to be waning.

abstract={Common social tagging systems like Flickr, del.icio.us and others lately became very popular. The key benefits of these systems include that users get involved in the content creation process, can easily -without overhead - comment or annotate Web content, share resources with fellow users, and benefit from the comments / annotations of other users with improved retrieval support. With GroupMe! we extend the idea of current social tagging systems by enabling users to not only tag Web resources they are interested in, but also to create collections (groups) of these Web resources by simple drag & drop operations. The grouping metaphor is intuitive and easy for the users, and our evaluation shows that users appreciate the grouping facility, and use this feature to organize and structure Web content. Technically, the grouping of resources carries valuable information about Web resources and their relations, and can be exploited to improve the mining of Web content, e.g. for search and retrieval.},

So as to keep with the ease of use characteristic of social media, simple explanations are required. A working hypothesis of the work reported in this paper is that simple explanations require simple reasoning. The approach to reasoning presented in this paper is minimalist: First, it precludes involved forms of reasoning such as refutation or excluded middle; second, it does not need (structural) induction. It is furthermore pragmatic: it incorporates negation as failure and an ad hoc and primitive form of paraconsistent reasoning. Because reasoning is kept simple, a simple and intuitive approach to explanation based only on proof trees is possible. This paper outlines the approach to both reasoning and explanations. Finally, it discusses more sophisticated explanation concepts, based on a notion of proof factorization, that are deemed necessary in the application context considered.},

abstract={The Web 2.0 maximizes the Internet concept of encouraging its users to cooperate effectively for the offer of virtual services and content organization. Among the various potentialities of the Web 2.0, folksonomy appears as a result of the free assignment of tags to the Web's resources by their users/readers. Despite tags describe the Web's resources, generally they are not integrated in the metadata. In order for them to be intelligible by machines and therefore used in the Semantic Web context, they have to be automatically allocated to specific metadata elements. There are many metadata formats. The focus of this investigation will be the Dublin Core Metadata Terms (DCTerms) that is a widely used set of properties for the description of electronic resources. A subset of DCTerms, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES), has been adopted by the majority of Institutional Repositories' platforms as a way to promote interoperability. We propose a research that intends to identify elements of the metadata originated from folksonomies and propose an application profile for DC Social Tagging. That will allow tags to be conveniently processed by interoperability protocols, particularly the Open Archives Initiative - Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). This paper will present the results of the pilot study developed in the beginning of the research as well as the metadata elements preliminarily defined.},

abstract={Social tagging systems provide an open platform for users to share and annotate their resources such as photos and URLs. Due to their open nature, however, these systems present a security problem. Malicious users may try to distort the system's behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. This paper addresses the problem of modeling attacks against social tagging systems and evaluating their impact on the systems' behavior. Gaining a fundamental understanding of the nature and impact of such attacks will hopefully lead to more secure and robust social Web applications. We present the dimensions that characterize an attack and outline a framework to model the attacks based on various navigation channels and target elements. Using our framework we classify and identify different types of potential attack strategies against a social tagging system. We implement two of our attack models and evaluate their impact on retrieval algorithms commonly used by tagging systems.

The model shows that the quality of tags not only influences search efficiency, but also the quality of mental categories formed during exploratory search. In addition, the model shows that aggregate regularities can be explained by microstructures of behavior that emerged from the adaptive assimilation of concepts and categories of multiple users through the social tagging system. The model has important implications on how collaborative systems could influence higher-level cognitive activities. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of the question labelling practices by contrasting the use of community generated tags in the Live QnA service with the use of topic categories from a fixed taxonomy in the Yahoo! Answers service. We found that community tagging is related to higher levels of social interactions amongst users. Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics. Thus, appropriate care needs to be taken when designing search, browsing, and recommender features for question discovery. © 2008 IEEE.},

In general, the Chinese tagging site provides its users with more pre-set functions whereas its American counterpart gives more freedom to its taggers. Our findings also show that tagging, like many other information behaviors, is greatly influenced by and stamped with the social and cultural traditions existing in each country. Taggers in both countries, however, do tend to choose terms of same or similar meanings, indicating that tagging, regardless of where it is done and where the tagger is from, is usually done according to the fundamental rules in indexing (e.g., nouns or noun phrases as tags). On the other hand, tagging as an activity unique in the networked environment for loosely representing and organizing all kinds of information, does not seem equal to keyword indexing which has been done in producing database systems (e.g., InfoTrac) and search engines (e.g., Google).},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

Some first approaches are already practically implemented. Recently, activities to edit and organize tags have been described as "tag gardening". We discuss different ways to subsequently revise and reedit tags and thus introduce different "gardening activities"; among them models that allow gradually adding semantic structures to folksonomies and/or that combine them with more complex forms of knowledge organization systems. Moreover, power tags are introduced as tag gardening candidates and the personal tag repository TagCare is presented. Copyright © 2008, Isabella Peters & Katrin Weller.},

However, the ambiguity of the assigned keywords hinders the knowledge sharing process. In this paper we present an approach for supporting tagging process by interpreting the keywords (tags) using a conceptual Tag model, which leads to a semantic tagging process. Moreover, the approach introduces the tag refinement process that proposes extensions of given tags in order to help the user to better express his/her "tagging" need. We present several evaluation studies in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate information items. In case of music, the annotated items can be songs, artists, albums. Current music recommenders which employ social tagging to improve the music recommendation, fail to always provide appropriate item recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for a musical item, and (ii) musical items may have multiple facets. In this paper, we propose an approach that tackles the problem of the multimodal use of music. We develop a unified framework, represented by a 3-order tensor, to model altogether users, tags, and items. Then, we recommend musical items according to users multimodal perception of music, by performing latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition technique. We experimentally evaluate the proposed method against two state-of-the-art recommendations algorithms using real Last.fm data. Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.},

abstract={This paper aims to quantify two common assumptions about social tagging: (1) that tags are "meaningful" and (2) that the tagging process is influenced by tag suggestions. For (1), we analyze the semantic properties of tags and the re-lationship between the tags and the content of the tagged page. Our analysis is based on a corpus of search keywords, contents, titles, and tags applied to several thousand popu-lar Web pages. Among other results, we find that the more popular tags of a page tend to be the more meaningful ones. For (2), we develop a model of how the influence of tag sug-gestions can be measured. From a user study with over 4,000 participants, we conclude that roughly one third of the tag applications may be induced by the suggestions. Our results would be of interest for designers of social tagging systems and are a step towards understanding how to best leverage social tags for applications such as search and information extraction.

abstract={Folksonomy is the result of describing Web resources with tags created by Web users. Although it has become a popular application for the description of resources, in general terms Folksonomies are not being conveniently integrated in metadata. However, if the appropriate metadata elements are identified, then further work may be conducted to automatically assign tags to these elements (RDF properties) and use them in Semantic Web applications. This article presents research carried out to continue the project Kinds of Tags, which intends to identify elements required for metadata originating from folksonomies and to propose an application profile for DC Social Tagging. The work provides information that may be used by software applications to assign tags to metadata elements and, therefore, means for tags to be conveniently gathered by metadata interoperability tools. Despite the unquestionably high value of DC and the significance of the already existing properties in DC Terms, the pilot study show revealed a significant number of tags for which no corresponding properties yet existed. A need for new properties, such as Action, Depth, Rate, and Utility was determined. Those potential new properties will have to be validated in a later stage by the DC Social Tagging Community.},

Furthermore, we show by an evaluation using human-created relevance assessments the general suitability of the anchortext tag generation in terms of user-perceived precision values. The awareness of this easy-to-obtain source of tags could trigger the rise of new tagging portals pushed by this automatic bootstrapping process or be applied in already existing portals to increase the number of tags per page by merely looking at the anchortext which exists anyway.

The results show that in the current context, social tags yield an effective retrieval process, whereas automatically generated metadata do not.

abstract={Over the last decade, it has been widely argued that technology-enhanced learning could respond to the needs of the new knowledge society and transform the way we learn. However, despite isolated achievements, technology-enhanced learning has not really succeeded yet in revolutionizing our education and learning processes. In fact, most current initiatives do not focus on the social aspect of learning and learning content is still pushed to a pre-defined group of learners in closed environments. Recently, Web 2.0 concepts have started to open new doors for more effective learning and have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of traditional learning models. In this paper we show in which way the community-driven platform Learnr, under development at the University of Münster, puts crucial success factors for future technology enhanced learning into practice, applying well known concepts like networking and social tagging. As a consequence, a Web 2.0 perspective on learners, learning content and learning communities can be derived.},

Experimentally, we focus on the problem of extracting protein mentions from academic publications in the eld of biology, where the source domain data are abstracts labeled with protein mentions, and the target domain data are wholly unlabeled captions. We mine the large number of such full text articles freely available on the Internet in order to supplement the limited amount of annotated data available. By exploiting the explicit and implicit common structure of the different subsections of these documents, including the unlabeled full text, we are able to generate robust features that are insensitive to changes in marginal and conditional distributions of classes and data across domains. We supplement these domain-insensitive features with automatically obtained high-condence positive and negative predictions on the target domain to learn extractors that generalize well from one section of a document to another. Finally, lacking labeled target testing data, we employ comparative user preference studies to evaluate the relative performance of the proposed methods with respect to existing baselines.

abstract={Folksonomies are a decentralized yet collaborative form of classification based on user-defined keywords (also known as tags). Although this uncontrolled method of classification lacks rules for term standardization and usage, it has potential for organizational patterns and an emerging vocabulary (terminology). The objective of this research is to analyze the descriptors and tags from journal articles indexed in the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and the folksonomy-based website CiteULike to determine overlap between the controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies. Metadata from 2,786 journal articles indexed in ERIC and CiteULike was collected using Perl and MySQL. The total metadata was comprised of 2,899 unique ERIC descriptors, 3,176 unique CiteULike tags, and 1,083 unique CiteULike users. An analysis of this metadata revealed that 240 of the CiteULike tags matched ERIC descriptors. The low number of tag-descriptor matches in this research indicates that CiteULike users do not use the same terminology as subject specialists who maintain descriptors in the ERIC thesaurus.

abstract={To make the most of a global network effect and to search and filter the Long Tail, a collaborative tagging approach to social search should be based on the global activity of tagging, rating and filtering. We take a further step towards this objective by proposing a shared conceptualization of both the activity of tagging and the organization of the tagosphere in which tagging takes place. We also put forward the necessary data standards to interoperate at both data format and semantic levels. We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms. This improves search results in terms of recall and precision, and represents an innovative means of semantics-aware collaborative filtering and content ranking. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Many advanced recommendation frameworks employ ontologies of various complexities to model individuals and items, providing a mechanism for the expression of user interests and the representation of item attributes. As a result, complex matching techniques can be applied to support individuals in the discovery of items according to explicit and implicit user preferences. Recently, the rapid adoption of Web2.0, and the proliferation of social networking sites, has resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, the unification of personal information with ontologies using the contemporary knowledge representation methods often associated with Web2.0 applications, such as community tagging, is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a method for the unification of tags with ontologies by grounding tags to a shared representation in the form of Wordnet and Wikipedia. We incorporate individuals' tagging history into their ontological profiles by matching tags with ontology concepts. This approach is preliminary evaluated by extending an existing news recommendation system with user tagging histories harvested from popular social networking sites.},

People today are less likely to watch shows at the same time, let alone the same place. As a result, television viewing, which was once a social activity, has been reduced to a passive and isolated experience. To study this issue, we developed a system called CollaboraTV and demonstrated its ability to support the communal viewing experience through a month-long field study. Our study shows that users understand and appreciate the utility of asynchronous interaction, are enthusiastic about Collabora TV's engaging social communication primitives and value implicit show recommendations from friends. Our results both provide a compelling demonstration of a social television system and raise new challenges for social television communication modalities. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Although social tagging has received attention in the LIS field as a promising information organization mechanism, there is little research comparing user-supplied tags and search queries. For using user-supplied tags as an alternative or supplementary tool for existing image representation schemes, there should be evidence which demonstrate to what extent there are similarities and/or differences between user-supplied tags and search terms. Based on these considerations, this study investigates categorical differences between user supplied tags and Web search queries. Using Shatford's categories, the study identifies categorical characteristics of tags and queries. Using the 1st level of categories, a rough comparison was made. User-supplied tags contain Generic terms for the majority, but Web search queries include Specific terms, rather than Generic terms. For a more detailed comparison between tags and queries, the 2nd level of categories from Shatford's was adopted. In most of subcategories, the categorical comparisons between tags and queries demonstrate considerable differences. Although this result is based on a small size of data sets, the result of this study can impact the way of social tagging systems and indexing/ranking systems of Web search engines for images.},

abstract={Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={One of the cornerstones of the Social Web is informal user-generated metadata (or tags) for annotating web objects like pages, images, and videos. However, many realworld domains are currently left out of the social tagging phenomenon due to the lack of a wide-scale tagging-savvy audience - domains like the personal desktop, enterprise intranets, and digital libraries. Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement. © 2008 IEEE.},

Still, it is an open issue how to exploit this user-created content, and how to process and use these emergent semantics effectively. We investigate how the context of Web resources can be utilized to improve recommender strategies in social tagging systems. We focus on the Group Mesystem, which enables users to create groups in order to bundle Web resources. Group Megroups form valuable context information for the resources contained in such groups. In this paper we exploit graph-based tag recommendation strategies, evaluate them in the Group Medataset, and benchmark our results against other approaches. In our evaluations we show that graph-based strategies outperform other approaches, and show the immanent benefit of graph-based recommendation strategies which exploit the group context for recommending tags to untagged resources. © 2008 IEEE.},

The social component of the interface presents information about which tags are most frequently accessed by others: allowing students to infer those parts of the lecture of most interest to others. We demonstrate the utility of the approach in a 6 week fieldwork study. Social summaries are used much more than corresponding systems that do not provide social information.

abstract={Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content w ithin W eb 2 .0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which over impose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as w ell as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, w e propose Social Ranking , a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2 .0 . We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. W e infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommend s) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, w eighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users w ho created those tags. A thorough evaluation cond ucted on the CiteULike dataset d emonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy. © 2008 A C M.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports the findings from an exploratory study investigating how MNCs are leveraging Web 2.0 applications to improve knowledge sharing and creation within and across their boundaries. As Web 2.0 and social networking are typically of a grassroots nature, the implementation of Web 2.0 applications may result in tensions in more traditional hierarchical organizations. For example, individuals may self-organize to participate in mass collaboration across temporal and spatial boundaries, thus facilitating the leakage of 'private' organizational knowledge across the organization's boundaries, which may be contrary to more traditional organizational forms and management norms. To guide our investigation, we categorize multinationals into four quadrants according to their maturity of how they are utilizing Web 2.0 and social networking either within their intra-organizational boundaries or in an extended inter-organizational context. Interestingly, all the multinationals under investigation demonstrate curiosity towards experimenting with new social networking tools through pilot studies or other initiatives of different scales. Examples are 1) utilizing MS SharePoint platforms internally to take advantage of collaboration and knowledge sharing through wikis, blogs, and social tagging, 2) using social networking sites for recruiting purposes that may cause considerable savings, 3) using Facebook for connecting geographically dispersed employees, and 4) utilizing virtual worlds such as Second Life to support collaboration as well as co-creation and innovation across academic and public researcher groups through facilitating a rich collaborative space. The study identified challenges related to the implementation of Web 2.0 in multinationals including poor top management support and understanding of Web 2.0's benefits, potential for knowledge leakage, social overload, attracting individuals to participate in networking activities, and the ability to measure the value of implementing Web 2.0. Finally, we discuss the potential and the role of Web 2.0 and social networking in future knowledge management systems of multinational firms. When incorporated in an organization's routines, Web 2.0 applications may enable multinationals to more fully leverage the knowledge sharing and creation potential of its employees across distributed locations than traditional knowledge management has done in the past. The challenge is to manage the increasing fluidity between the boundaries of organizational and individual knowledge in addition to between the boundaries of organizational and individual activities. Furthermore, management must increasingly focus on communicating to individuals about the multinational's competitive landscape, such as which knowledge is required for sustainable competitive advantage now and in the future. Since few studies so far have focused on the role of Web 2.0 in knowledge management, we suggest that future research should pay attention to how multinationals proceed in their efforts of implementing new social networking tools and how this may influence their existing knowledge management strategy and practices.},

abstract={The wiki concept is more than 10 years old but has attained public success only recently, thanks to Wikipedia. However, in the intranet world, several studies have shown that the usage of wikis is subject to debate. Acceptance of such open, low-structured collaborative tools is not the rule. There are different reasons for explaining such low acceptance: social reasons (corporate culture may not be adapted) but also usability reasons (the wiki is not structured enough, it is hard to navigate and find relevant information, the wiki markup language used by most wiki engine makes people reluctant to contribute to the wiki, etc.). In this chapter we present SweetWiki, a new wiki engine that relies on Semantic Web technologies and addresses most usability problems that have been reported in Buffa and Gandon (2006), Chat and Nahaboo (2006), and Powers, (2005). SweetWiki is an example of an application reconciling two trends of the future Web: a semantically-augmented Web and a Web of social applications where every user is an active actor and provider. SweetWiki makes heavy use of Semantic Web concepts and languages and demonstrates how the use of such paradigms can improve navigation, search, and usability. By semantically annotating the resources of the wiki and by reifying the wiki object model itself, SweetWiki provides reasoning and querying capabilities. All the models are defined in OWL schemata capturing concepts of the wikis (wiki word, wiki page, forward and backward link, author, etc.) and concepts manipulated by the users (users' folksonomy, external ontologies). These ontologies are exploited by an embedded semantic search engine (Corese) allowing us to support and ease the lifecycle of the wiki (e.g., restructuring pages), to propose new functionalities (e.g., semantic search, profile-based monitoring) and to allow for extensions (e.g., support new medias in pages, integrate legacy software). In SweetWiki we have paid special attention to preserve the essence of a wiki: simplicity and social dimension. Thus SweetWiki supports all the common wiki features such as easy page linking using WikiWords, versioning, and so forth, but also innovates, integrating a WYSIWYG editor extended to support social tagging functionalities, embedded SPARQL queries, and so forth, masking the OWL-based annotation implementation. Users can freely enter tags and an auto-completion mechanism suggests existing ones by issuing queries to identify existing concepts with compatible labels. Thus tagging is both easy and motivating (real time display of the number of related pages) and concepts are collected in folksonomies. Wiki pages are served directly in XHTML or in JSPX format, embedding semantic annotations ready to be reused by other Semantic Web software. © 2008, IGI Global.},

Thereby, we use the Inclusive Universal Access paradigm to assess social tagging with respect to socio-technical criteria for inclusive and barrier-free provision and usage of web services. From this analysis we propose criteria for a paradigm we chose to call "Inclusive Social Tagging."

Our system makes recommendations based only on the textual contents of the resource and is independent of existing tags, thus allowing the emergence of novel tags. The system was evaluated by a group of users and statistical measures were applied to infer its performance. Results show that the system is not only able to suggest many useful tags, but also to discover new and relevant tags, not suggested by any of the human users. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The goal of this paper investigates if tags are an effective means for helping users locate useful resources. Adopting techniques from text categorization, we downloaded Web pages and their associated tags from del.icio.us, and trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to determine if the documents could be assigned to their associated tags. Results from the classifiers in terms of precision, recall and Fl score were mixed, suggesting that that not all tags could be used by public users for resource discovery.

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging, otherwise known as "folksonomies", emanate from the flexibility they afford users in navigating large information spaces for resources, tags, or other users, unencumbered by a pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchy. Despite its advantages, social tagging also increases user overhead in search and navigation: users are free to apply any tag they wish to a resource, often resulting in a large number of tags that are redundant, ambiguous, or idiosyncratic. Data mining techniques such as clustering provide a means to overcome this problem by learning aggregate user models, and thus reducing noise. In this paper we propose a method to personalize search and navigation based on unsupervised hierarchical agglomerative tag clustering. Given a user profile, represented as a vector of tags, the learned tag clusters provide the nexus between the user and those resources that correspond more closely to the user's intent. We validate this assertion through extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Although a number of people have participated in tagging activity on many Web 2.0 sites and the sites allow users to get their tagging data through Mash-up APIs, there are many issues (e.g. tag semantics) associated with social tagging or folksonomies. Many studies have focused on semantics of a tag that offers a way of exact meaning of an individual tag or among the tags. Surprisingly, there has been minimal research regarding tag sharing or exchange. We suggest a semantic model, is called the 'SCOT (Semantic Social Cloud of Tags)', to represent the structure and the semantics of tagging data. We also discuss social tagging processes in order to provide semantic interoperability of tagging data among diverse sources. The int.ere.st web site aims to allow users to search and bookmark their social tagging data and to help the sharing and exchange of tagging data among people or heterogenous sources. We give an overview of int.ere.st with the social tagging processes and describe specific algorithms to support the processes.

In particular, we have found that (1) analyses of conflicts and coordination in Wikipedia have shown us the scientific need to understand social sensemaking environments; and (2) information theoretic analyses of social tagging behavior in del.icio.us shows the need to understand human vocabulary systems.},

abstract={Social tagging sites such as Flickr, YouTube and del.icio.us are becoming increasingly popular. Users of these sites annotate and endorse content by tagging, and form social ties with other users by including them into their friendship network. The richness of social context raises the users' expectations with respect to the quality of served content, but also presents a unique opportunity for the design of semantically-enriched recommender systems. This paper presents a variety of methods for producing customized hotlists and evaluates their effectiveness on del.icio.us datasets. We model a user's interest in terms of the tags he uses to annotate content, and in terms of his explicitly stated and derived social ties, and demonstrate how such interest can be leveraged to produce holistic of very high quality. We also discuss possible research directions and outline strategies for the design of a social tagging recommender system.

abstract={A huge amount of data and metadata emerges from Web 2.0 applications which have transformed the Web to a mass social interaction and collaboration medium. Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Conventional Web image search engines can return reasonably accurate results for queries containing concrete terms, but the results are less accurate for queries containing only abstract terms, such as "spring" or "peace." To improve the recall ratio without drastically degrading the precision ratio, we developed a method that replaces an abstract query term given by a user with a set of concrete terms and that uses these terms in queries input into Web image search engines. Concrete terms are found for a given abstract term by making use of social tagging information extracted from a social photo sharing system, such as Flickr. This information is rich in user impressions about the objects in the images. The extraction and replacement are done by (1) collecting social tags that include the abstract term, (2) clustering the tags in accordance with the term co-occurrence of images, (3) selecting concrete terms from the clusters by using WordNet, and (4) identifying sets of concrete terms that are associated with the target abstract term by using a technique for association rule mining. Experimental results show that our method improves the recall ratio of Web image searches. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={As the number of Web 2.0 sites offering tagging facilities for the users' voluntary content annotation increases, so do the efforts to analyze social phenomena resulting from generated tagging and folksonomies. Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused. In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as Semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data. © 2008 IEEE.},

Moreover, each resource can be described by adopting multiple points of view, which usually correspond to different end-users. These different points of view can be defined by using multiple ontologies which can be related to connected (or not-connected) domains.

abstract={Social tagging systems such as del.icio.us and flickr have recently increased in popularity. The easy use of tags, along with the ability to publicly share tags and resources from others, has attracted many users to actively participate. However, more and more users are facing the problem of effectively organizing and browsing the increasing tags and resources in one's personal tag space. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically group tags in one's personal tag space into tag clusters thus helping the user organize the large tagged resources effectively. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model one's personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We also propose a visual interface model for tag browsing by incorporating Tag Cloud and clustering technology, where tags in each cluster are organized as a tag-cloud. Experiments on del.icio.us show that the clustering results are very similar to bundles manually created by users. The presented algorithm not only groups the semantic-related tags into clusters, but also generates meaningful descriptions for each cluster automatically. In addition, the prototype system shows that the grouped Tag Cloud visualization interface improves the visual representation of a typical Tag Cloud layout. ©2008 IEEE.},

Earlier clustering techniques have shown limited improvements, since they were based mostly on tag co-occurrences. In this paper, a co-clustering approach is employed, that exploits joint groups of related tags and social data sources, in which both social and semantic aspects of tags are considered simultaneously.

abstract={Social tagging systems have been largely adopted by users as useful and powerful tools to organize, browse and share interested resources on the web. All the tags used and resources collected by a user constitute the user's personal tag space, which contains valuable information that can be used for building and enhancing the user model. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine user profile from one's personal tag space. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model one's personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We dejine several properties for each concept generated to evaluate the degree of such concept to depict the user's interest, and then a novel algorithm is introduced to construct a hierarchical user profile from the built lattice. Experiments are carried out on the dataset collected from delicious and a detailed real-life case study is presented. Results show that the hierarchical user profile can describe the target user's interests well enough, as well as organizing and browsing the tags and collocated resources effectively.

Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This study compared the search information retrieval (IR) performance of folksonomies from social bookmarking Web sites against search engines and subject directories. Thirty-four participants created 103 queries for various information needs. Results from each IR system were collected and participants judged relevance. Folksonomy search results overlapped with those from the other systems, and documents found by both search engines and folksonomies were significantly more likely to be judged relevant than those returned by any single IR system type. The search engines in the study had the highest precision and recall, but the folksonomies fared surprisingly well. Del.icio.us was statistically indistinguishable from the directories in many cases. Overall the directories were more precise than the folksonomies but they had similar recall scores. Better query handling may enhance folksonomy IR performance further.

abstract={Academic librarians are challenged with development and maintenance of collections of research materials in various formats. Although it is assumed that they are monitoring the needs of their constituencies as a part of the collection management decision-making process, the literature reflects only a few studies that focus on direct solicitation of user opinions. This study included a 22-question survey sent to all faculty, staff, and graduate students in a cross-section of social science disciplines (anthropology, psychology, social work, and sociology) at one institution. Responses from 122 individuals (32.1% of faculty, 13.6% of graduate students, and 9.8% of staff) provide data about book and journal use that have informed collection development priorities and reveal shifting patterns of use in an increasingly hybrid (print and electronic) information environment. Results show that faculty and graduate students in all disciplines depend heavily on library collections and generally prefer to access materials online. When looking for books most respondents started from the library catalog, but those who indicated that the library was not important were more likely to search the Web and rely on colleagues to access materials, suggesting that social tagging might be an effective means of supporting resource discovery, especially if embedded in a scholarly community of practice. The relative importance of books and journals varies among (and within) disciplines and in accordance with the task at hand. Books are heavily used for teaching in all four disciplines, while journals are generally more important for research, especially among the more science-oriented specializations within anthropology and psychology. Even within these two disciplines, however, there are a number of scholars who rely heavily on books for research. Most respondents reported occasional use of interlibrary loan, more commonly for books than for journal articles, and this was generally considered to be an important and useful supplement to locally owned materials.},

abstract={A panel at VLDB 2007 that examined the relationship between Web 2.0 and data management, and explored the opportunities this new medium presents is discussed. Tags assigned to photos, videos, and Web sites vary from highly informative to meaningless meta-tags typos and misspelling and intentionally misleading annotations. Web 2.0 is all about people providing content, where the users will try to combine the content in interesting ways in order to provide new content and more importantly, provide new services. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a popular method that uses machine learning to determine interest overlap between users based on their behavior such as common ratings of items, or common purchasing and browsing patterns. A user's interest can be modeled in terms of the tags he uses to annotate content, and in terms of his explicitly stated and derived social ties in social tagging sites.},

abstract={Everyone agrees that user interactions and social networks are among the cornerstones of "Web 2.0". Web 2.0 applications generally run in a web browser, propose dynamic content with rich user interfaces, offer means to easily add or edit content of the web site they belong to and present social network aspects. Well-known applications that have helped spread Web 2.0 are blogs, wikis, and image/video sharing sites; they have dramatically increased sharing and participation among web users. It is possible to build knowledge using tools that can help analyze users' behavior behind the scenes: what they do, what they know, what they want. Tools that help share this knowledge across a network, and that can reason on that knowledge, will lead to users who can better use the knowledge available, i.e., to smarter users. Wikipedia, a wildly successful example of web technology, has helped knowledge-sharing between people by letting individuals freely create and modify its content. But Wikipedia is designed for people-today's software cannot understand and reason on Wikipedia's content. In parallel, the "semantic web", a set of technologies that help knowledge-sharing across the web between different applications, is starting to gain attraction. Researchers have only recently started working on the concept of a "semantic wiki", mixing the advantages of the wiki and the technologies of the semantic web. In this paper we will present a state-of-the-art of semantic wikis, and we will introduce SweetWiki, an example of an application reconciling two trends of the future web: a semantically augmented web and a web of social applications where every user is an active provider as well as a consumer of information. SweetWiki makes heavy use of semantic web concepts and languages, and demonstrates how the use of such paradigms can improve navigation, search, and usability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This work focusses on bridging between folksonomies, which provide social but mainly flat and unstructured metadata on web resources, and semantic web ontologies, which instead design structured, machine-processable knowledge spaces. The main purpose is to capture emerging semantics in social tagging systems and to overcome the gap between Semantic Web and Web 2.0, by preserving the complementary advantages of social and ontology-driven methods for describing, categorizing and processing web content. As a way to bridge this gap, we propose a method for linking tags from a folksonomy to concepts of an existing ontology, adopting a statistic approach. We have applied the proposed method to the data collected through the art portal Arsmeteo, relating them to the concepts of an OWL ontology of emotions. Intuitively, by our method we try to capture the latent emotional semantics of the tags. Some of the artworks in Arsmeteo could be visited in real exhibitions. In order to capture the emotional potential of the tagging activity during the visit, we explored the possibility to enable tagging of artifacts in real spaces, by using Semacode technology. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={The aim of the TERM project - Tagging (extra, external) Electronic Resources for Modules - is to investigate the extent to which social bookmarking can be used to promote collaborative learning. The motivation for doing this is to enable students to get more value from the informal collections of on-line resources that they may gather to support their learning. The study has two main strands: identifying the barriers to sharing resources; and exploring potential solutions. The latter has focussed on exploiting both the social and technology opportunities provided by "Web 2.0". The human side of sharing resources has been explored through qualitative surveys with both Computing and Art and Design students to understand the sources of information that they find most useful in their studies, how they currently record and manage references to on-line resources, and their attitudes to sharing this information. These were then reassessed following a pilot study on the use of social book marking. The technology associated with sharing resources has been explored through the use of the del.icio.us social book marking service. A range of options for using the service were evaluated for their practicality, usability and manageability. The options included individual versus group accounts, and stand-alone access versus integration with the institution's VLE. This led to the development of a shared tagging system within the VLE, linked to a shared delicious account, which was then evaluated with one of the cohorts of students from the survey phase. Evaluation of the TERM VLE enhancement and its use by students raises a number of interesting but potentially conflicting findings relating to their attitudes, their actions, and the technology required to support them. The majority of students were positive about tagging and sharing, but a significant minority were still using technology that did not facilitate sharing. In addition, while the students wanted to be able to share their resources, they wanted to be able to do this outside of the VLE which provides a common platform for doing so. This highlights the tension between the development of shared taxonomies versus the desire for individual control and autonomy. The initial results of the study support the desirability of developing collaborative resource sharing, and of the use of web 2.0 platform technology in doing so. As such, they would be of interest to projects engaged in developing collaborative teaching and learning practice and the technological challenges associated with it.},

Additional respondents recognized the tools but did not use them in a medical or nursing context, with a minimal number using any tools to expand their medical or nursing knowledge. A lack of time to set up and use the resources, difficulty of set-up and use, skepticism about the quality of user-generated medical content, and a lack of perceived need for Web 2.0 resources contributed substantially to non-use.

However, the benefits of social tagging come at the cost of reduced machine-understandable and reduce effectiveness in information retrieval and organization. To address the above limitations, we propose a framework, UNITAG, to enhance existing social tagging systems with semantic information.

abstract={We are teaching a new generation of students who have been cradled in technologies, communication, and an abundance of information. As a result, the design of learning technologies needs to focus on supporting social learning in context. Instead of designing technologies that “teach” the learner, the new social learning technologies will perform three main roles: 1) support the learner in finding the right content (right for the context, particular learner, specific purpose of the learner, and pedagogically), 2) support learners to connect with the right people (right for the context, learner, purpose, educational goal, etc.), and 3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. In the pursuit of such environments, new areas of science become relevant as a source of methods and techniques, such as social psychology, economic/game theory, and multiagent systems. This paper illustrates how social learning technologies can be designed using some existing and emerging technologies: ontologies versus social tagging, exploratory search, collaborative versus self-managed social recommendations, trust and reputation mechanisms, mechanism design, and social visualization. © 2008 IEEE},

abstract={Steve is a two-year old collaboration between art museums whose research project, funded by the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services, seeks to learn whether (and how) social tagging can serve art museums. We are interested in discovering whether and how non-professionals' descriptions of artworks differ from professional cataloguing, as well as how volunteer taggers may experience the activity of looking at and describing museum collections. To support our research, we have built an open source tagging tool, developed methods for analyzing user-contributed descriptions of artworks, and begun to study the nature of the tags contributed by end users. In keeping with the open, collaborative philosophy of the project, we will make both our research results and our raw data available to interested members of the community. Our briefing will provide an update on current and future project activities and discoveries, including a review of our tools, a summary of findings to date, and a discussion of our data set and analytical framework.},

However, CF systems still suffer a weakness: They do not take context into consideration. Yet recently, social tagging systems have become popular-these systems provide a well suited combination of context clues through tags as well as important social connectivity among users. Thus, we combine the features of these two systems to create a contextual CF model based upon tagging information.},

The relation of indexing consistency with 'language-in-use' is discussed. We then proceed to take a look at a few examples of much older systems that relate closely with the lessons now being learned in social tagging today, in order to situate the present activity in its historical context - and examine a few approaches used for text-based search-and-retrieval and their relevance to tag corpora. To conclude, some distinctions between personal, social and global information management are discussed.},

While there has been considerable interest in social tagging systems in recent years, little is known about their actual usage. In this paper, we present the results of a field study of a social bookmarking service that has been deployed in a large enterprise. We present new qualitative and quantitative data on how a corporate social tagging system was used, through both event logs (click level analysis) and interviews. We observed three types of search activities: community browsing, personal search, and explicit search. Community browsing was the most frequently used, and confirms the value of the social aspects of the system. We conclude that social bookmarking services support various kinds of exploratory search, and provide better personal bookmark management and enhance social navigation. © 2007 Springer.},

The approach is based on the idea of using tagging process as a method for refinement (pruning) of the ontology that has been learned automatically from available knowledge sources. In the nutshell of the approach is a model for the conceptual tag refinement, which basically searches for terms that are conceptually related to the tags that are assigned to an information source. In that way the meaning of the tags can be disambiguated, which support better usage of the tagging process for the ontology pruning. We have developed a software tool, an annotation framework, which realizes this idea. We present results from the first evaluation studies regarding the application of this approach in the eGovernment domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={When authors publish their interpretations of the ideas, opinions, claims or rebuttals in the literature, they are drawing on a repertoire of well understood moves, contributing to an extended discourse. Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

abstract={Collaborative (or social tagging) options are being added to many database catalogs on the assumption that not only those who assign tags but also those who use the catalog find such tags beneficial. But no quantitative analyses of collaborative tags exist to support this assumption. Based on questionnaires mixing collaborative tag clouds from http://www.LibraryThing.com and controlled Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH) strings from the Library of Congress catalog http://catalog.loc.gov, it was found that controlled vocabulary terms are selected above collaborative terms; that the string format is preferred to the cloud; that strings appear to "perform" better in terms of reflecting book content; and that it is important to users that recall is high (where uncontrolled vocabulary retrieval is generally low). Results were found to be dependent upon particulars of tag cloud or string. The outcome indicates that catalog users would derive fewer information retrieval benefits from the current form of collaborative clouds than from the staid strings of the Library of Congress Subject Headings.},

abstract={The Word Wide Web is a continuous challenge to machine learning. Established approaches have to be enhanced and new methods be developed in order to tackle the problem of finding and organising relevant information. It has often been motivated that semantic classifications of input documents help solving this task. But while approaches of supervised text categorisation perform quite well on genres found in written text, newly evolved genres on the web are much more demanding. In order to successfully develop approaches to web mining, respective corpora are needed. However, the composition of genre- or domain-specific web corpora is still an unsolved problem. It is time consuming to build large corpora of good quality because web pages typically lack reliable meta information. Wikipedia along with similar approaches of collaborative text production offers a way out of this dilemma. We examine how social tagging, as supported by the MediaWiki software, can be utilised as a source of corpus building. Further, we describe a representation format for social ontologies and present the Wikipedia Category Explorer, a tool which supports categorical views to browse through the Wikipedia and to construct domain specific corpora for machine learning.},

abstract={As Web 2.0 aims to be a more dynamic, interactive, information-rich environment, social tagging, or the creation of user-defined metadata by users, (as well as the outcome of tagging, folksonomies or the development of user-centered vocabularies or lists of keywords that can be used for searching and subject access) (Dye, 2006), is a practice developing to foster online collaboration, independent information sharing and distribution, as well as open communication. Systems that enable social tagging are becoming more common. In the Web 2.0 environment, tagging and folksonomies have been used in different contexts such as photo sharing sites like Flickr, video sharing sites like YouTube, blog search engines like Technorati, and in social bookmarking sites like del.icio.us and LibraryThing (Etches-Johnson, 2006). It is generally assumed that more users are learning about and actually tagging resources. Academic articles on tagging are becoming more common (for example, Golder & Huberman, 2005; Marlow, Naaman, Boyd & Davis, 2006). However, little has been reported about tagger's motivations (Abbas, 2007; Abbas & Graham, 2006), the different contexts of tagging, and the the implications for practices and for the library and information science profession (Abbas & Graham, 2006). While the Web 2.0 environment has become a virtual laboratory for exploring the efficacy and utility of social tagging, as well as tagging practices, integrating social tagging into current business and professional practices at different institutions and professions deserves a reality check. The purposes of the panel are: 1) to explore the different contexts in which tagging is being used, 2) to examine how well social tagging has been adopted by several professions such as newspapers, libraries, museums, and within different contexts such as the Web (image and digital video sharing sites), corporations, medical professions, and other information professions, and 3) to discuss implications tagging may have to the library and information science profession.

abstract={Knowledge workers often need to find, organize, and work with heterogeneous resources from diverse services, information stores, and repositories. This paper analyzes two problems that knowledge workers frequently encounter: difficulty in finding all relevant resources across diverse services, and difficulty in formulating and executing searches for resources related to their current activity-of-interest. The Malibu project explores solutions to these problems through a dynamic peripheral display that aggregates knowledge resources from multiple services to support activity-centric work. Of particular interest is the ability to select a knowledge resource and use it as a metonym (a proxy) for its social-tagging metadata in a tag-based search for related resources among heterogeneous services. We evaluated our solutions to these two problems through convergent analyses of quantitative (data log) and qualitative (interview and discussion data) data. Our partial successes show the strength of these new ideas, and indicate areas for future research. © 2007 Springer.},

abstract={Ontology development is fundamental to most knowledge management efforts. When approached in a formal knowledge engineering manner the resulting ontology usually becomes brittle when spanning even a modest number of groups within a single organization. It breaks entirely when scaled to multiple, heterogeneous organizations. A promising alternative is the bottom-up approach such as can be found in social tagging systems (e.g., del.ico.us), but little research has examined the utility of these systems for knowledge reuse activities. In this paper we extend our field work with IT helpdesk staff to examine the drivers for natural ontology development. We found that a balance between some degree of external order while maintaining local flexibility was required. This information space is navigated via social relations, especially expert referral. We examine the user-centered design criteria for both mid-level ontology development and related expert profile management. © 2007 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper we present a study in which we explore the potential use of social tagging in providing access to large information systems. Tags are user-supplied access points for information resources [1], e.g., short labels that characterize pieces of information. As part of longterm research efforts to assess the usefulness of tags for retrieving content from large information spaces, we set up a first experiment in which we investigate the tags people assign to content We chose a TV-guide that offers recommendations to users on interesting programs according to their tastes to be our case. Participants were asked to tag a number of TV programs. They were also asked to give a rating for the program. The results show a variety of tags. We composed a category scheme of these tags, which on a high level distinguishes between attitude tags, content tags, and self-reference tags. Tags that reflect the genre, the participant's opinion, and the program's characteristics were assigned most often. Surprisingly, no relationship was found between attitude tags and the rating participants have assigned to the program. We feel that the results can be generalized to other settings such as the field of document design and technical communication, including instructional texts. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Information organization and search on the Web is gaining structure and context awareness and more semantic flavor, for example, in the forms of faceted search, vertical search, entity search, and Deep-Web search. I envision another big leap forward by automatically harvesting and organizing knowledge from the Web, represented in terms of explicit entities and relations as well as ontological concepts. This will be made possible by the confluence of three strong trends: 1) rich Semantic-Web-style knowledge repositories like ontologies and taxonomies, 2) large-scale information extraction from high-quality text sources such as Wikipedia, and 3) social tagging in the spirit of Web 2.0. I refer to the three directions as Semantic Web, Statistical Web, and Social Web (at the risk of some oversimplification), and I briefly characterize each of them. Semantic Web: Although the Semantic Web in its originally envisioned glorious form is still a very elusive goal, the vision itself has created a significant momentum towards creating ontologies and representing knowledge in more rigorous formats than text (see, e.g., [5,7]). These include general-purpose ontologies and thesauri such as SUMO, OpenCyc, ConceptNet, or WordNet, as well as domain-specific ontologies and terminological taxonomies such as GeneOntology, SNOMED, or UMLS. While each of these collections alone may be viewed as fairly partial, connecting them and combining them with "softer" knowledge sources such as Wikipedia could be a powerful way of organizing more and more knowledge in rigorous representations that allow effective querying and reasoning. Richly annotated natural-language corpora such as multilingual thesauri, word-sense-tagged texts, or even representations in logic-based frames start becoming an interesting asset as well. Statistical Web: Information-extraction (IE) technology - entity recognition and learning relation patterns - has made enormous progress and become much more scalable in recent years [1,10] and also much less dependent on human supervision [3,4,8]. Much of this progress comes from major advances in the underlying fields of natural language processing (NLP) and statistical learning, but there is also a much better understanding of algorithmic efficiency and how to engineer large-scale IE. To be clear, all these technologies will remain computationally expensive, but the gloomy picture of such issues being "AI-complete" and practically hopeless is gone. Social Web: There is a growing amount of "low-hanging fruit" that allows us to harvest knowledge without any rocket science. A large extent of this comes from the Web 2.0 trends, or more specifically, the human contributions to the emerging Social Web (aka. Human Semantic Web) in the form of tagging (and thus semantically annotating) Web pages, passages or phrases in pages, images, videos, etc. and creating so-called folksonomies (e.g., [6,10]). Another big contributor is the strong proliferation of high-quality knowledge repositories with some explicit structure that is suitable for entity, relation, and topic recognition. Probably, Wikipedia is the best example. Although it is still primarily hyperlinked text, the link structure, the thematic categories to which articles are manually assigned, and the templates that are used for authoring certain types of articles (e.g., about music bands) provide enormous benefits for semantic tagging. Several recent projects have made excellent use of Wikipedia and similar sources for building explicit knowledge bases and connecting these with other sources (e.g., [2,9]). Each of the three directions - Semantic Web, Statistical Web, Social Web - poses interesting research themes. I believe that connecting these different kinds of implicit and explicit knowledge sources opens up synergies and great opportunties towards the vision of large-scale knowledge management and search. The talk will present various approaches in each of three areas, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and point out ideas on a combined methodology. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Folksonomies are often a tag cloud which are usually listed alphabetically and weighted by popularity. Tags are useful for users to navigate the site and suggest weather they are on the right track. Users tagged website to organize their bookmark and find things later or share them with others. Tags can later be searched to organize a large collection into categories in tune with the user's own idiosyncratic mental model. Content producer submitting items to a collection, tag their item, so that user browsing through or searching the folksonomy can ultimately see their content.

Design/methodology/ approach - The approach to examining Flickr and Democratic Indexing is evaluative. The limitations of Flickr are described and examples are provided. The Democratic Indexing approach, which the authors believe offers a method of marshalling a "free" user-indexed archive to provide useful retrieval functions, is described. Findings - The examination of both Flickr and the Democratic Indexing approach suggests that, despite Shirky's claim of philosophical paradigm shifting for social tagging, there is a residing doubt amongst information professionals that self-organising systems can work without there being some element of control and some form of "representative authority". Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature of user-based indexing and social tagging. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We present an approach for making explicit the semantics behind the tag space in social tagging systems, so that this collaborative organization can emerge in the form of groups of concepts and partial ontologies. This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Analysis of tagging habits demonstrates that social tagging systems such as del.icio.us and flickr include both formal metadata, such as geotags, and informally created metadata, such as annotations and descriptions. The majority of tags represent informal metadata; that is, they are not structured according to a formal model, nor do they correspond to a formal ontology. Statistical exploration of the main tag corpus demonstrates that such searches use only a subset of the available tags; for example, many tags are composed as ad hoc compounds of terms. In order to improve accuracy of searching across the data contained within these tags, a method must be employed to decompose compounds in such a way that there is a high degree of confidence in the result. An approach to decomposition of English-language compounds, designed for use within a small initial sample tagset, is described. Possible decompositions are identified from a generous wordlist, subject to selective lexicon snipping. In order to identify the most likely, a Bayesian classifier is used across term elements. To compensate for the limited sample set, a word classifier is employed and the results classified using a similar method, resulting in a successful classification rate of 88%, and a false negative rate of only 1%.},

abstract={As the "software space" of source code, documentation, models, and other programming artifacts continue to grow in size and complexity, programmers face the challenge of navigating this space, as well as documenting and sharing their journeys for other developers and future successors. Current navigational structures are either closely tied to the semantics of the software or are constructed in a constrained top-down fashion to match the architecture or requirements of the system. In this paper, we introduce the notion of combining waypoints from geographical positioning and social tagging from shared bookmark systems to allow programmers to create shared, tagged points in software space. We report preliminary progress on our prototype (tagSEA), and discuss our future plans.},

We report on aggregated views of communal tags and review arguments concerning the relationship between folksonomy (the emergent process of communal classification) and formal ontology, rejecting the strong view that faces them against each other as opposing solutions. Finally we present a novel framework for abstracting latent structures in folksonomic categorization in a way that facilitates their conversion to formal ontologies. This should enhance their usefulness in integrating resources from different sources.},

It aims to show how the widespread homogeneous and flat keywords' space of tags can be effectively mixed with a richer faceted classification scheme to improve the "information scent" and "berrypicking" capabilities of the system. The additional semantic structure is aggregated both implicitly observing user behaviour and explicitly introducing a compelling user experience to facilitate the creation of relationships between tags directly by end-users. Facetag current implementation is written in PHP / SQL and includes an open API which allows querying and integration from other applications.},

When a user clicks a recommended link, Aikuchi highlights a marked string. We offered the system as part of a conference support system. According to the analysis of user logs, users preferred Web page recommendations based on strings marked by other users to those based on page similarity using TFIDF and collaborative filtering. As a result, we think that marked strings can act as usergenerated metadata.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have become rather popular for annotating any kind of resources ranging from electronic documents to real world objects. In current tagging systems resources as a whole are annotated with and referenced by user defined tags. For multimedia data, as e. g. for video data, single scenes can be identified and annotated by using MPEG-7 metadata. We propose a collaborative tagging system that is combined with an automated annotation system for synchronized multimedia presentations. MPEG-7 metadata are used for the annotation of single scenes with user compiled tagging information in combination with metadata provided directly by the author or by other annotation systems. Thus, we propose a system being able to search within multimedia data that can further be extended to search within any kind of (partial) document to achieve a more tightly focused and personalized search.},

abstract={The collections of art museums have been assembled over hundreds of years and described, organized and classified according to traditions of art historical research and discourse. Art museums, in their role as curators and interpreters of the cultural record, have developed standards for the description of works of art (such as the Categories for the Description of Works of Art, CDWA) that emphasize the physical nature of art as artefact, the authorial role of the creator, the temporal and cultural context of creation and ownership, and the scholarly significance of the work over time. Collections managers have recorded conservation, exhibition, loan and publication history, along with significant volumes of internal documentation of acquisition and storage, that support the custody and care of artefacts of significant cultural value. But the systems of documentation and classification that support the professional discourse of art history and the management of museum collections have failed to represent the interests, perspectives or passions of those who visit [use?] museum collections, both on-site and online. As museums move to reflect the breadth of their audiences and the diversity of their perspectives, so must museum documentation change to reflect concerns other than the traditionally art historical and museological. Social tagging offers a direct way for museums to learn what museum-goers see in works of art, what they judge as significant and where they find or make meaning. Within the steve collaboration(http://www.steve.museum), a group of art museums is collectively exploring the role of social tagging and studying the resulting folksonomy (Bearman & Trant, 2005; Chun, Cherry, Hiwiller, Trant, & Wyman, 2006; Trant & Wyman, 2006). Analysis of terms collected in the prototype steve tagger suggests that social tagging of art museum objects can in fact augment museum documentation with unique access points not found in traditional cataloguing. Terms collected through social tagging tools are being compared to museum documentation, to establish the actual contributions made by naïve users to the accessibility of art museum collections and to see if social classification provides a way to bridge the semantic gap between art historians and art museums' publics.},

We address the subject by using the notion of content collaboration as example for the "Prisoner's Dilemma", in which the sensible way out (from a macroperspective) is sensibly not pursued by an individual (from a microperspective). We will use this micro-perspective of a user as prisoner to analyze what the recently very successful Social Tagging processes can teach us about the user taking action as a producer and/or consumer.},

Answering this question can help us understand the emergence of many communication systems, from bacterial communication to human languages, as well as helping to design algorithms for supporting self-organizing information systems such as social tagging or ad-word systems for the web. We introduce a formal communication model in which senders and receivers can adapt their communicative behaviors through a type of win-stay lose-shift adaptation strategy. We find by simulations and analysis that for a given number of meanings, there exists a threshold for the number of words below which the agents can't converge to a shared vocabulary. Our finding implies that for a communication system to emerge, agents must have the capability of inventing a minimum number of words or sentences. This result also rationalizes the necessity for syntax, as a tool for generating unlimited sentences. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract={Metadata provided by annotations are an essential prerequisite for the realization of the semantic web. The manifold of metadata uses on the other hand also implies an abundance of different annotation types and formats, each requiring a different semantic treatment of the data. For semantically rich documents this results in a hybrid mixture of metadata about one and the same document. Further metadata diversity arises, if more than one author contributes to the annotation as it is typical for the now popular social tagging systems. Documents however, despite this heterogeneity show common structural properties that can be classified as logical, conceptual, and referential. There are intrinsic dependencies within and across those structures that have to be made explicit. We argue that the dependency structure as an explicit annotation is essential for any semantically rich document in order to be better understandable not only for man but also for machine.},

These tags (also called concepts, categories, facets or entities) can be used to classify web resources and to express users' preferences. Folksonomy-based systems allow users to classify web resources through tagging bookmarks, photos or other web resources and saving them to a public web site like Del.icio.us. Thus information about web resources and online articles can be shared in an easy way. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the folksonomy tagging phenomenon (also called social tagging and social bookmarking) and explore some of the reasons why we need controlled vocabularies, discussing the problems associated with folksonomy.},

abstract={Purpose - User-created metadata, often referred to as folksonomy or social classification, has received a considerable amount of attention in the digital library world. Social tagging is perceived as a tool for enhancing description of digital objects and providing a venue for user input and greater user engagement. This article seeks to examine the pros and cons of user-generated metadata in the context of digital image collections and compares it to professionally created metadata schema and controlled vocabulary tools. Design/methodology/approach - The article provides an overview of challenges to concept-based image indexing. It analyzes the characteristics of social classification and compares images described by users to a set of images indexed in a digital collection. Findings - The article finds that user-generated metadata vary in the level of description, accuracy, and consistency and do not provide a solution to the challenges of image indexing. On the other hand, they reflects user's language and can lead toward user-centered indexing and greater user engagement. Practical implications - Social tagging can beimplemented as a supplement to professionally created metadata records to provide an opportunity for users to comment on images. Originality/value - The article introduces the idea of user-centered image indexing in digital collections.},

abstract={Documentation of art museum collections has been traditionally written by and for art historians. To make art museum collections broadly accessible, and to enable art museums to engage their communities, means of access need to reflect the perspectives of other groups and communities. Social Tagging (the collective assignment of keywords to resources) and its resulting Folksonomy (the assemblage of concepts expressed in such a cooperatively developed system of classification) offer ways for art museums to engage with their communities and to understand what users of online museum collections see as important. Proof of Concept studies at The Metropolitan Museum of Art compared terms assigned by trained cataloguers and untrained cataloguers to existing museum documentation, and explored the potential for social tagging to improve access to museum collections. These preliminary studies, the results of which are reported here, have shown the potential of social tagging and folksonomy to open museum collections to new, more personal meanings. Untrained cataloguers identified content elements not described in formal museum documentation. Results from these tests - the first in the domain - provided validation for exploring social tagging and folksonomy as an access strategy within The Metropolitan Museum, motivation to proceed with a broader inter-institutional collaboration, and input into the development of a multi-institutional collaboration exploring tagging in art museums. Tags assigned by users might help bridge the semantic gap between the professional discourse of the curator and the popular language of the museum visitor. The steve collaboration (http://www.steve.museum) is building on these early studies to develop shared tools and research methods that enable social tagging of art museum collections and explore the utility of folksonomy for providing enhanced access to collections.},

abstract={What processes can explain how very large populations are able to converge on the use of a particular word or grammatical construction without global coordination? Answering this question helps to understand why new language constructs usually propagate along an S-shaped curve with a rather sudden transition towards global agreement. It also helps to analyse and design new technologies that support or orchestrate self-organizing communication systems, such as recent social tagging systems for the web. The article introduces and studies a microscopic model of communicating autonomous agents performing language games without any central control. We show that the system undergoes a disorder/order transition, going through a sharp symmetry breaking process to reach a shared set of conventions. Before the transition, the system builds up non-trivial scale-invariant correlations, for instance in the distribution of competing synonyms, which display a Zipf-like law. These correlations make the system ready for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on the timescale of collective behaviours, becomes sharper and sharper with system size. This surprising result not only explains why human language can scale up to very large populations but also suggests ways to optimize artificial semiotic dynamics. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd. and SISSA.},

We argue that, despite Shirky's (2005) claim of philosophical paradigm shifting for social tagging, there is a residing doubt amongst information professionals that self-organising systems can work without there being some element of control and some form of 'representative authority' (Wright, 2005).},

abstract={This paper outlines the purposes, predications, functions, and contexts of information organization frameworks; including: bibliographic control, information retrieval, resource discovery, resource description, open access scholarly indexing, personal information management protocols, and social tagging in order to compare and contrast those purposes, predications, functions, and contexts. Information organization frameworks, for the purpose of this paper, consist of information organization systems (classification schemes, taxonomies, ontologies, bibliographic descriptions, etc.), methods of conceiving of and creating the systems, and the work processes involved in maintaining these systems. The paper first outlines the theoretical literature of these information organization frameworks. In conclusion, this paper establishes the first part of an evaluation rubric for a function, predication, purpose, and context analysis.},
