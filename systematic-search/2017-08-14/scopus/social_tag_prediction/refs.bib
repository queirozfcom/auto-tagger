abstract={Personalized microblog recommendations face challenges of user cold-start problems and the interest evolution of topics. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on a temporal interest evolution model and social tag prediction. Three matrices are first prepared to model the relationship between users, tags, and microblogs. Then the scores of the tags for each microblog are optimized according to the interest evolution model of tags. In addition, to address the user cold-start problem, a social tag prediction algorithm based on community discovery and maximum tag voting is designed to extract candidate tags for users. Finally, the joint probability of a tag for each user is calculated by integrating the Bayes probability on the set of candidate tags, and the top n microblogs with the highest joint probabilities are recommended to the user. Experiments using datasets from the microblog of Sina Weibo showed that our algorithm achieved good recall and precision in terms of both overall and temporal performances. A questionnaire survey proved user satisfaction with recommendation results when the cold-start problem occurred. © 2015, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Cepstral analysis is effective in separating source from filter in vocal and monophonic [pitched] recordings, but is it a good general-purpose framework for working with music audio? We evaluate covariance in spectral features as an alternative to means and variances in cepstral features (particularly MFCCs) as summaries of frame-level features. We find that spectral covariance is more effective than mean, variance, and covariance statistics of MFCCs for genre and social tag prediction. Support for our model comes from strong and state-of-the-art performance on the GTZAN genre dataset, MajorMiner, and MagnaTagatune. Our classification strategy based on linear classifiers is easy to implement, exhibits very little sensitivity to hyper-parameters, trains quickly (even for web-scale datasets), is fast to apply, and offers competitive performance in genre and tag prediction. © 2010 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={Different approaches based on content or tag information have been proposed to address the problem of tag recommendation for a web page. In this paper, we analyze two approaches in a graph of web pages. Each node is a web page and edges represent hyperlinks. The first approach uses the content while the second one uses tag information in the graph. The second approach makes two assumptions about the tag set of two interacting nodes. The Tag Similarity Assumption claims that two interacting nodes discuss about rather similar topics; therefore, the chance of having more similar tag set is higher. The Tag Collaboration Assumption says that two interacting nodes complement each others topics. We apply algorithms such as Self Organizing Map (SOM), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and K-means clustering to compare methods on several datasets. We conclude that tag-based tag predictors outperform their content-based peers by more than ten percent with respect to the cosine similarity between predicted and actual tag sets.},

abstract={Recently, social tag recommendation has gained more attention in web research, and many approaches were proposed, which can be classified into two types: rule-based and classification-based approaches. However, too much expert experience and manual work are needed in rule-based approaches, and its generalization is limited. Additionally, there are some essential barriers in classification-based approaches, since tag recommendation is transformed into a multi-classes classification problem, such as tag collection is not fixed. Different from them, ranking model is more suitable, in which supervised learning can be used. In additions, the whole tag recommendation task can be divided into 4 subtasks according to the existence of users and resources. In different subtasks, different features are constructed, in order that existed information can be used sufficiently. The experimental results show that the proposed supervised ranking model performs well on the training and test dataset of RSDC 2008 recovered by ourselves.},

abstract={In this paper, we look at the "social tag prediction" problem. Given a set of objects, and a set of tags applied to those objects by users, can we predict whether a given tag could/should be applied to a particular object? We investigated this question using one of the largest crawls of the social bookmarking system del.icio.us gathered to date. For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags. Our results have implications for both the study of tagging systems as potential information retrieval tools, and for the design of such systems. Copyright 2008 ACM.},
