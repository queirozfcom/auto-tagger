  abstract  = {Equipping an imaginary Random Surfer of the Web with the ability to teleport, was Page et al.'s creative way to justify a mathematical necessity; the Teleportation Matrix. Despite being essential for ensuring the ergodicity of the underlying Markov chain, the standard definition of this matrix treats the nodes of the graph in a simplistic and “leveling” way that can prove counterintuitive - especially for applications of the method on graphs of heterogeneous data. In this work, we focus on such graphs and we propose a novel alternative teleportation model that yields a well-defined ranking vector, while being as easy to handle as the traditional teleportation. We explore the theoretical implications of our model, and we reveal a wealth of nice properties that result to direct computational advantages over PageRank. We conduct a set of experiments using real-world datasets and we verify both the useful computational characteristics of our model and its favorable qualitative performance. Our promising findings suggest there remain more to be explored, and maybe much to be gained, by revisiting the teleportation model; a neglected part of PageRank that is typically taken for granted by the majority of applications in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Mashups are prevalent Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) based applications consisting of multiple Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and content. Tags have been extensively used to organize and index mashup services. However, people favor manual tags creation in the past. This approach demands user intervention, which is extremely time-consuming and probes to errors. In this paper we propose a novel Mashup-API-Tag model for automatic mashup tag recommendation. The model simultaneously incorporates the composition relationships between mashups and APIs as well as the annotation relationships between APIs and tags to discover the latent topics. Then the semantic similarity between Web APIs and mashups can be acquired. Subsequently, tags of chosen APIs are recommended to a mashup where the mashup and the APIs are most similar. In addition, we develop a tag filtering algorithm to select the most relevant tags for recommendation. The experimental results on a real world dataset prove that our approach outperforms other methods, including frequency-based methods and the methods that only consider the composition relationships and the annotation relationships separately.},

  abstract = {Given a collection of web images with the corresponding textual descriptions, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain learning method to classify these web multimedia objects by transferring the correlation knowledge among different information sources. Here, the knowledge is extracted from unlabeled objects through unsupervised learning and applied to perform supervised classification tasks. To mine more meaningful correlation knowledge, instead of using commonly used visual words in the traditional bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, we discover higher level visual components (words and phrases) to incorporate the spatial and semantic information into our image representation model, i.e., bag-of-visual-phrases (BoP). By combining the enriched visual components with the textual words, we calculate the frequently co-occurring pairs among them to construct a cross-domain correlated graph in which the correlation knowledge is mined. After that, we investigate two different strategies to apply such knowledge to enrich the feature space where the supervised classification is performed. By transferring such knowledge, our cross-domain transfer learning method can not only handle large scale web multimedia objects, but also deal with the situation that the textual descriptions of a small portion of web images are missing. Empirical experiments on two different datasets of web multimedia objects are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain transfer learning method.},

Searching a hash tag simply shows a list of tweets, each contains the query hash tag string. To find even more relevant hash tags, we propose to use a graph-based approach to find similar hash tags by using the social network graph around hash tags. We start by using a heterogeneous social graph that contains users, tweets, and hash tags, then we summarize the graph to a hash tag graph that shows the similarity between different hash tags. Finally, we rank the vertices in respect to a query hash tag using a random walk with restart and a content similarity measure.

Moreover, the coupling scheme is also an efficient tool to investigate various aspects of the influence propagation on multiple OSNs. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthesized datasets not only confirm the quality of the solution but also reveal interesting insights into the behavior of influence propagation in and across the networks.},

  abstract  = {In tag-word disambiguation, a word is assigned to a specific context chosen among the different ones to which it is related. Relatedness to a context is often defined based on the co-occurrence of the target word with other words (context words) in sentences of a specific corpus. The overall disambiguation process can be thought as a classification process, where the context words play the role of features for the target. A problem with this approach is that the large number of possible context words can reduce the classification performance, both in terms of computational effort and in terms of quality of the outcome. Feature selection can improve the process in both regards, by reducing the overall feature space to a manageable size with high information content. In this work we propose to use, in disambiguation, a feature selection approach based on the Shapley Value (SV) - a Coalitional Game Theory related metrics, measuring the importance of a component within a coalition. By including in the feature set only the words with the highest Shapley Value, we obtain remarkable quality and performance improvements. The problem of the exponential complexity in the exact SV computation is avoided by an approximate computation based on sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and of the sampling approach results, by using both a synthetic language corpus and a real world linguistic corpus.},

The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.},

Our goal is to identify more users from the same company. We formulate this problem as a task of classifying nodes over a graph, and develop a Supervised Label Propagation model. It naturally incorporates the rich set of features for social activities, models the networking effect by label propagation, and learns the feature weights so that the labels are propagated to the right users. To validate its effectiveness, we show our case studies on identifying the employees of "China Telecom" and "China Unicom" from Sina Weibo.

Our experiments demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to extract a concept associated with a photograph with an overall precision score of 80%.

  abstract  = {The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

However, these tags are often imprecise and incomplete, which essentially limits tag-based image indexing and related applications. To tackle this issue, we propose an image retagging scheme that aims at refining the quality of the tags. The retagging process is formulated as a multiple graph-based multi-label learning problem, which simultaneously explores the visual content of the images, semantic correlation of the tags as well as the prior information provided by users. Different from classical single graph-based multi-label learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm propagates the information of each tag along an individual tag-specific similarity graph, which reflects the particular relationship among the images with respect to the specific tag and at the same time the propagations of different tags interact with each other in a collaborative way with an extra tag similarity graph. In particular, we present a robust tag-specific visual sub-vocabulary learning algorithm for the construction of those tag-specific graphs. Experimental results on two benchmark Flickr image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image retagging scheme. We also show the remarkable performance improvements brought by retagging in the task of image ranking.},

This paper proposes a combination of similarity based indexing “tag title and abstract” and static ranking to improve search results. In this particular study, the year of the published paper and type of research paper publication are combined with similarity ranking called (HybridRank). Different weighting scores are employed. The retrieval performance of these weighted combination rankings are evaluated using mean values of NDCG. The results suggest that HybridRank and similarity rank with weight 75:25 has the highest NDCG scores. From the preliminary result of experiment, the combination ranking technique provide more relevant research paper search results. Furthermore the chosen heuristic ranking can improve the efficiency of research paper searching on social bookmarking websites.},

  abstract = {As requirements of organisations change, so do the software systems within them. When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.},

Most prior works have explored two learning strategies independently for domain adaptation: feature matching and instance reweighting. In this paper, we show that both strategies are important and inevitable when the domain difference is substantially large. We therefore put forward a novel Transfer Joint Matching (TJM) approach to model them in a unified optimization problem. Specifically, TJM aims to reduce the domain difference by jointly matching the features and reweighting the instances across domains in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is invariant to both the distribution difference and the irrelevant instances. Comprehensive experimental results verify that TJM can significantly outperform competitive methods for cross-domain image recognition problems.},

While any one individual may not provide sufficient samples, aggregating samples across many individuals provides high-quality, high-coverage measurements of the phenomena. Thus, for participatory sensing to be successful, one must motivate a large number of individuals to participate. In this work, we review a variety of incentive mechanisms that motivate people to contribute to a CS effort. We then establish a set of design constraints or minimum requirements that any incentive mechanism for CS must have. These design constrains are then used as metrics to evaluate those approaches and determine their advantages and disadvantages. We also contribute a taxonomy of CS incentive mechanisms and show how current systems fit within this taxonomy. We conclude with the identification of new types of incentive mechanisms that require further investigation.},

However, it can be problematic given the visual variations between anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method for similarity computation in medical imaging. Instead of the low-level visual appearance, we design a CCA-PairLDA feature representation method to capture the similarity between images with high-level semantics. First, we extract the PairLDA topics to represent an image as a mixture of latent semantic topics in an image pair context. Second, we generate a CCA-correlation model to represent the semantic association between an image pair for similarity computation. While PairLDA adjusts the latent topics for all image pairs, CCA-correlation helps to associate an individual image pair. In this way, the semantic descriptions of an image pair are closely correlated, and naturally correspond to similarity computation between images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets for image retrieval and showed improved performance.},

This approach involves secondary sharing of user data and potentially benefits the user in terms of improved personalization and better experience. However, concerns regarding privacy arise when sharing user data with unknown third parties. These concerns can be alleviated at two stages: i) ensuring selective control of the applications to share user data with, and ii) monitoring and penalizing errant data consumers who violate the terms of their contractual agreement and potentially abuse user data. This paper addresses the second stage of data use contract enforcement. We propose a trust management mechanism for monitoring data consumers' compliance to the contractual agreements for which data was shared with them. The trust mechanism is based on user complaints about suspected privacy violations and is able to identify the data consumers who are responsible. The framework penalizes the data consumer found guilty of violating its data use agreement by decreasing its trust value. This makes the data consumer less likely to be selected to receive user data, and limits its participation in the user data marketplace, forcing it to pay a higher price for purchase of user data.},

First, a semantic computing technique devised for mood-related tags in large datasets is applied to Last.fm and I Like Music (ILM) corpora separately (250,000 tracks each). The resulting semantic estimates are then correlated with listener ratings of arousal, valence and tension. High correlations (Spearman's rho) are found between the track positions in the dimensional mood spaces and listener ratings using both data sources (0.60 <; rs <; 0.70). In addition, the use of curated editorial data provides a statistically significant improvement compared to crowd-sourced data for predicting moods perceived in music.},

In a previous work we identified that technical knowledge is usually available in unstructured textual electronic means (e.g. chat, mail, blogs, etc. - also known as UTEMs) used by AGSD workers during development, although not necessarily easily accessible. Also, we proposed the concept of Knowledge Condensation as a means to recover knowledge from UTEMs, by introducing a structure to their contents along with means to retrieve knowledge. In this work we present our first step towards a Knowledge Condensation tool, through a prototype tagging mechanism to structure architectural knowledge during UTEM interactions. We evaluated the prototype and obtained the following results: (1) a high perception of usefulness and a high projected intention of use, and (2) the identification of 6 tagging behavior profiles from participants. These tagging behaviors can be grouped as (i) participants who tag as expected, (ii) participants who tag more than expected, and (ii) participants who tag less than expected. These results suggest that it is important to cope with "little or no tagging" and "excessive tagging" behaviors to implement knowledge condensation based on UTEM tagging. Furthermore, we identified that tagging could be a good option to structure UTEM interactions, and to retrieve architectural knowledge from UTEM logs. Future work includes improving the tagging mechanism prototype based on the participants' suggestions and overall evaluation results, and implementing a searcher prototype to further evaluate the concept of knowledge condensation based on tagging of UTEM interactions.},

It is a challenging task because information provided by users on an SNS platform could be false, conflicting, missing and deceptive. One way to gain an accurate profile of a user is to link up all their multiple accounts created on different social platforms, which is referred to as Account Linkage (AL). However, existing AL techniques suffer from the problem of information unreliability. Recent advances in location acquisition and wireless communication technologies give rise to new opportunities for AL. In this paper, we propose a framework that links up multiple accounts belonging to the same individual by comparing habit patterns extracted from user-generated location data. We built a topic model to capture users habit patterns in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

  abstract  = {Designing software for collaborative sensemaking environments begins with a set of very challenging requirements. At a high level, the software needs to be flexible enough to support multiple lines of inquiry, contradictory hypotheses, and collaborative tasking by multiple analysts. It should also include support for managing evolving human/machine workflows and analytic products at various levels of strictness and formality, processing partial and ambiguous evidence arriving in streams, and developing explanatory scenarios based on both serendipitous and structured discovery. Eventually, it should support the analytic team as they evaluate multiple alternatives and converge on one or more consensus responses, while preserving the history and underlying reasoning. Finally, it should be delightful and simple to use, not require an inordinate degree of precision and exactness, and be quickly and inexpensively deployable in a variety of rapid-response analytic situations. It has not been possible thus far to create a single software architecture that adequately balances all these goals. However, we can shed useful light on this problem by looking at the experience of semantic wiki architectures: an emerging class of software that blends wikis, databases, social tagging systems, and Semantic Web representations.},

  abstract  = {Content consuming and sharing are two most important user activities in social networking sites (SNSs). Lots of studies have been conducted on content recommendation using users' common interests. However, little has been done to help users to select friends and share content within their social networks. In this paper, we contribute a recommendation framework AOPUT to recommend both content and friend list for sharing to users leveraging content and social information in SNSs. It consists of two recommendation components: Recder and ShareAider. Recder generates content recommendations by connecting users with common interests. An improved Jaccard similarity is proposed to improve the Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation quality. ShareAider recommends a friend list to users when they want to share content with their friends. CF method and a social-based method are compared and the combination of them are explored to achieve better results. AOPUT is evaluated on a real world social network. The experimental results show that (1) Recder can provide better recommendation quality than the traditional CF method thanks to the improved Jaccard similarity; (2) social-based method performs better than CF since the sharing behavior in SNSs are highly dominated by users' social preferences, and the combination of these two methods performs better than each of them individually.},

In social networks, the user circles are built not only based on their relationships in real-life, but also on common interests. Some existing approaches cannot fully capture users' similarity from the perspective of their common interests, while some other approaches are too time-consuming or space-consuming. In this paper, we propose a method of identifying users' interest similarity based on clustering Hot Vertices (HotV). A hot vertex in a social network is an account which has a large number of fans. The approach extracts users' common interests by mining and clustering the hot vertices that the two users are following simultaneously. Both the experiment and theoretical analysis have proved that the proposed approach makes a significant improvement on the precision of similarity measuring with a relatively low time and space complexity.},

This paper introduces ARTEMIS - a scheme to enhance automatic selection of training images using an instance-weighted mixture modeling framework. An optimization algorithm is derived to learn instance-weights in addition to mixture parameter estimation, essentially adapting to the noise associated with each example. The mechanism of hypothetical local mapping is evoked so that data in diverse mathematical forms or modalities can be cohesively treated as the system maintains tractability in optimization. Finally, training examples are selected from top-ranked images of a likelihood-based image ranking. Experiments indicate that ARTEMIS exhibits higher resilience to noise than several baselines for large training data collection. The performance of ARTEMIS-trained image annotation system is comparable with usage of manually curated data sets.},

In this paper, we investigate whether a correlation emerges across the different activities a user can take part in. For our analysis, we focused on aNobii, a social platform with a world-wide user base of book readers, who post their readings, give ratings, review books, and discuss them with friends and fellow readers. aNobii presents a heterogeneous structure: 1) part social network, with user-to-user interactions; 2) part interest network, with the management of book collections; and 3) part folksonomy, with books that are tagged by the users. We analyzed a complete snapshot of aNobii and we focused on three specific activities a user can perform, namely tagging behavior, tendency to join groups and aptitude to compile a wishlist of the books one is planning to read. For each user, we create a tag-based, a group-based, and a wishlist-based profile. Experimental analysis, which was carried out with information-theory tools like entropy and mutual information, suggests that tag-based and group-based profiles are in general more informative than wishlist-based ones. Furthermore, we discover that the degree of correlation between the three profiles associated with the same user tend to be small. Hence, user profiling cannot be reduced to considering just any one type of user activity (albeit important) but it is crucial to incorporate multiple dimensions to effectively describe users' preferences and behavior.},

However, it is inefficient to extract communities from these whole newly generated networks with little differences every time, and then it is impossible to follow the network growths in the real time. We proposed an incremental community detection algorithm for high-volume graph streams. It is based on the top of a well-known batch-oriented algorithm named DEMON [1]. We also evaluated performance and precisions of our proposed incremental algorithm with real-world big networks with up to 410,236 vertices and 2,439,437 edges and computed in less than one second to detect communities in an incremental fashion - which achieves up to 107 times faster than the original algorithm without sacrificing accuracies.},

In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand. Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.},

Fortunately, along with the rise of social media, social network is producing a large and rich set of social data (such as labels, trust, etc.), which provides a new way to solve the problems of collaborative filtering, namely, we can make use of social data to enhance the recommendation accuracy. However, traditional recommendation algorithms may only consider either the influence of similarity relationships or trust relationships to the user model, but fail to take full advantage of the implications of social data. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm called STPMF based on neighborhood model and matrix factorization model, where complementary roles of similarity relationships and trust relationships to the user model by means of a weight w are considered simultaneously. Furthermore, we propagate similarity relationships and trust relationships one step or two steps to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems. We have conducted experiments on two real world data sets from Last.fm and Delicious. Compared with existing recommendation algorithms, our method can effectively alleviate the problems of collaborative filtering, and enhance the recommendation accuracy.},

We explore two broad approaches in predicting the popularity of videos in the network: consensus approaches based on aggregate behavior in the network, and social approaches based on the information diffusion over an implicit network. We measure the performance of our approaches under a simple caching framework by picking the k most popular videos according to our predicted distribution and calculating the hit rate on the cache. We develop our approach by first incorporating video inter-arrival time (based on the power-law distribution governing the transmission time between two receivers of the same message in scale-free networks) to the baseline (LRFU), then combining with an information diffusion model over the inferred latent social graph that governs diffusion of videos in the network. We apply techniques from latent social network inference to learn the sharing probabilities between users in the network and apply a virus propagation model borrowed from mathematical epidemiology to estimate the number of times a video will be accessed in the future. Our approach gives rise to a 14% hit rate improvement over the baseline.},

  abstract  = {In the big data era, detecting unsupervised communities in a given dataset, analyzing the evolution of the unsupervised communities, tracing the interests of users are very important. For instance, we can capture user's interest and provide personalized information. In order to detect unsupervised communities in social tagging networks, this paper uses similarity cloud properties of cloud model to solve the different community analysis, classification, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities problems. Cloud model is used in this paper. By introducing similarity cloud properties of cloud model, cloud model can detect the unsupervised communities, describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively, and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities. For illustration, the proposed model is applied to Delicious dataset to detect unsupervised communities and one month is used as time slice to study the evolutions of the unsupervised communities. Empirical results show that the unsupervised community in social tagging in network, using Similarity cloud properties of cloud model can effectively detect different unsupervised communities, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively. Similarity cloud properties based cloud model can effectively detect unsupervised community in social tagging network, and quantitatively describe the evolutions of the community and community user' dynamic interest. Hence, CBUCD model is an efficient solution for detecting unsupervised community and analyzing evolutions.},

  abstract = {Recent research shows that multimedia resources in the wild are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In this paper, the semantic link network model is used for organizing multimedia resources. A whole model for generating the association relation between multimedia resources using semantic link network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association. The hierarchical semantic of multimedia resources is defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different in the proposed framework. The modules of semantic link network model are implemented to measure association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two evaluation methods, including clustering and retrieval, are performed, which shows the proposed method can measure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.},

Adopting techniques from text categorization, we downloaded Web pages and their associated tags from del.icio.us, and trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to determine if the documents could be assigned to their associated tags. Results from the classifiers in terms of precision, recall and F1 score were mixed, suggesting that that not all tags could be used by public users for resource discovery.

Indeed, most of the systems base the indexing process on few generic text information (e.g., course title and teacher's name) and this creates problems to students who are looking for very specific topics and hence want to browse video in details. Moreover, additional metadata could provide useful information to those users who access the educational materials by means of assistive technologies. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows students to take on-the-fly notes while watching a video lecture and uses these notes to enrich video lectures with metadata that will be helpful to the indexing and retrieval process. In particular, to allow detailed video browsing, our proposed SOcial Learning (SOLE) system defines a set of eight predefined tagnotes and segments the lecture into a sequence of video chapters. Students can use the textual notes to describe and to retrieve the video material, providing hints about its content to users with special needs. To evaluate our approach, we developed a prototype version of SOLE and we asked for volunteer evaluators. Results showed that users feel comfortable in taking notes while watching a video and liked to browse video lectures using notes. According to the results obtained in the evaluation, both students and video lecture providers might appreciate the proposed approach.},

Based on CHH, a pairwise visual-textual correlation hypergraph (VTCH) model is used for tag-based social image search. To overcome the large number of newly generated hybrid hyperedges, a bagging-based method is adopted to balance the accuracy and speed. Finally, adaptive hyperedges learning method is used to obtain the relevance score for social image search. The experiments conducted on MIR Flickr show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

The traditional service discovery approaches mainly face two challenges: 1) the single source of description documents limits the effectiveness of discovery due to the insufficiency of semantic information; 2) more factors should be considered with the generally increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called SMS, for effectively discovering the appropriate services by incorporating social media information. Specifically, we present different methods to measure four social factors (semantic similarity, popularity, activity, decay factor) collected from Twitter. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model is applied to mine semantic information of services from meta-data of Twitter Lists that contains them. In addition, we assume the target query-service matching function as a linear combination of multiple social factors and design a weight learning algorithm to learn an optimal combination of the measured social factors. Comprehensive experiments based on a real-world dataset crawled from Twitter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework SMS, through some compared approaches.},

In this paper, we propose a recruitment method which takes into account individual and social attributes of workers to find suitable workers. The method discovers indirect collaborations between workers to harness implicit teamwork knowledge in order to increase the quality of crowd sourcing tasks' outcome and in the same time prevent collusion attacks.

We describe an approach to classify four major sub-genres of EDM using artificial neural networks. We extracted several rhythmic and statistical features from a database of 400 songs, evenly distributed among the four sub-genres, and used these features to train a Back Propagation Network (BPN) and a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). In addition to classification, we also employed the RELIEFF feature selection algorithm to reduce the number of features and improve our results. Comparing the performances of the two networks on the basis of their correct classifications, we observed that BPN combined with the features proposed yielded a better result of 94.16%.},

Full-text keywords retrieval process (FKRP) is generally used to obtain the keywords of posts, and the keywords were then used to cluster posts. Another approach is to use tags or categories chosen by bloggers for their posts. However, the overhead of FKRP is relatively high and the use of tagging is associated with synonymy related issues. More recently, there is an emerging concept called social tagging, which is about having web resources tagged by the general public together. Similar to this concept, we developed a blog connect platform that collects queried keywords used by the people for searching for a post. With the queried keywords, formal concept analysis (FCA) associated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is used to cluster posts. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is better than those of other studies.},

Fas Tag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of Fas Tag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, Fas Tag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags.

  abstract  = {Capstone project-based learning courses generate a suitable space where students can put into action knowledge specific to an area. In the case of Software Engineering (SE), students must apply knowledge at the level of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Management of Software Projects. There is a large number of supportive resources for SE that one can find on the web, however, information overload ends up saturating the students who wish to find resources more accurate depending on their needs. This is why we propose a crowdsourcing recommender engine as part of an educational software platform. This engine based its recommendations on content from StackExchange posts using the project's profile in which a student is currently working. To generate the project's profile, our engine takes advantage of the information stored by students in the aforementioned platform. Content-based algorithms based on Okapi BM25 and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used to provide suitable recommendations. The evaluation of the engine was held with students from the capstone course in SE of the University Catholic of Chile. Results show that Cosine similarity over traditional bag-of-words TF-IDF content vectors yield interesting results, but they are outperformed by the integration of BM25 with LDA.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have essentially become an integral part of our daily lives. There are hundreds of OSNs, each with its own focus and offers for particular services and functionalities. To take advantage of the full range of services and functionalities that OSNs offer, users often create several accounts on various OSNs using the same or different personal information. Retrieving all available data about an individual from several OSNs and merging it into one profile can be useful for many purposes. In this paper, we present a method for solving the Entity Resolution (ER), problem for matching user profiles across multiple OSNs. Our algorithm is able to match two user profiles from two different OSNs based on machine learning techniques, which uses features extracted from each one of the user profiles. Using supervised learning techniques and extracted features, we constructed different classifiers, which were then trained and used to rank the probability that two user profiles from two different OSNs belong to the same individual. These classifiers utilized 27 features of mainly three types: name based features (i.e., the Soundex value of two names), general user info based features (i.e., the cosine similarity between two user profiles), and social network topological based features (i.e., the number of mutual friends between two users' friends list). This experimental study uses real-life data collected from two popular OSNs, Facebook and Xing. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and its classification performance measured by AUC was 0.982 in identifying user profiles across two OSNs.},

  abstract = {Social tags serve as a textual source of simple but useful semantic metadata that reflect user preferences or describe web objects and have been widely used in many applications. However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e. non-IIDness), which means that existing text analysis methods such as LDA are not directly applicable. In this article, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation that models tag generation based on both users and objects and, thus, accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as a user-topic distribution matrix and an object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets showed that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely-used point-wise mutual information (PMI) metric. In addition, we analyze the learned topics and show that our model recovers more themes from social tags, while LDA may lead to vanishing topic problems. We also demonstrate our model's advantages in social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristics of the social tagging process.},

The goal is to allow viewers to browse video material using either general information (e.g., title, director) or specific emotions (e.g., “joy”, “sadness”, “surprise”).

Term Frequency and Proportional Document Frequency (TF*PDF) is employed as a means to detect hot topics from patents, and IPCs are used to calculate semantic importance of terms based on the IPCs where terms are distributed. Aging Theory is also used to calculate the variation of trends over time. Four types of trends including very stable trends, stable trends, normal trends, and unstable trends are defined and evaluated based on TF*PDF and TF*PDF combined with Aging Theory. Experiment results show that for very stable trends, the combination of TF*PDF and Aging Theory achieves 0.976% in Precision; for stable trends and all trends, TF*PDF achieves 0.959% and 0.84% in Precision, respectively. By applying TF*PDF in consideration of semantic information, we also show a new criteria for weighting hot topics and technology trend tracking.},

In parallel, the research field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has developed taxonomies to classify systems that support collaboration. However, the CSCW perspective presents a bias towards traditional user interface paradigms, whose affordances are quite distinct from those of 3DVW, which include features such as the spatial environment, embodiment, and their dynamics. These are features which are regarded as significant factors in the research field of Presence, and yet, in our opinion, are not well appreciated from the perspective of CSCW analysis. Because of this, we question of the ability of CSCW taxonomies to properly describe the collaboration characteristics of 3DVW. By “properly”, we mean to say that 3DVW bring to fore collaboration characteristics that are in fact distinctive of them as collaboration tools, impacting collaboration in ways that are seldom found in usual groupware, and yet CSCW taxonomies do not distinguish them. We posit that these features should be contemplated in CSCW taxonomies and their usefulness taken into account in the development of future systems that aim to support collaboration.},

The naive approach to perform filtering early at the publisher edge works only if complete knowledge of the subscriptions is available, which is not compatible with the well-established covering optimization in scalable content-based publish/subscribe systems. We propose an efficient rank-cover technique to reconcile top-k subscription filtering with covering. We extend the covering model to support top-k and describe a novel algorithm for forwarding subscriptions to publishers while maintaining correctness. Finally, we compare our solutions to a baseline covering system. In a typical setting, our optimized solution is scalable and provides over 81% of the covering benefit.},

The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.},

  abstract  = {While many Web 2.0-inspired approaches to semantic content authoring do acknowledge motivation and incentives as the main drivers of user involvement, the amount of useful human contributions actually available will always remain a scarce resource. Complementarily, there are aspects of semantic content authoring in which automatic techniques have proven to perform reliably, and the added value of human (and collective) intelligence is often a question of cost and timing. The challenge that this book attempts to tackle is how these two approaches (machine- and human-driven computation) could be combined in order to improve the cost-performance ratio of creating, managing, and meaningfully using semantic content. To do so, we need to first understand how theories and practices from social sciences and economics about user behavior and incentives could be applied to semantic content authoring. We will introduce a methodology to help software designers to embed incentives-minded functiona ities into semantic applications, as well as best practices and guidelines. We will present several examples of such applications, addressing tasks such as ontology management, media annotation, and information extraction, which have been built with these considerations in mind. These examples illustrate key design issues of incentivized Semantic Web applications that might have a significant effect on the success and sustainable development of the applications: the suitability of the task and knowledge domain to the intended audience, and the mechanisms set up to ensure high-quality contributions, and extensive user involvement.

Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robust for substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.},

  abstract = {Recently, in online social networks (OSNs), the least cost influence (LCI) problem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at identifying a minimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide cascade of information propagation. Most of existing literature investigated the LCI problem only based on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs such that information could be spread across different networks simultaneously. Therefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to consider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances. In this article, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the influence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI problem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and lossy coupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all properties of original networks to achieve high-quality solutions, while the lossy coupling scheme offers an attractive alternative when the running time and memory consumption are of primary concern. Various experiments conducted on both real and synthesized datasets have validated the effectiveness of the coupling schemes, which also provide some interesting insights into the process of influence propagation in multiplex networks.},

With the explosive growth of online texts such as online reviews and user-generated content, the text is becoming more sparse and much bigger, which poses significant challenges on both effectiveness and efficiency issues of text clustering. In our prior work, we presented a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm, which can avoid the zero-feature dilemma of highly sparse texts. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based approximate approach for scaling SAIL algorithm to deal with the large-scale of texts. Particularly, an instance-level random sampling is invoked to reduce the number of instances to be examined during each iteration, which substantially speeds up the clustering on big text data. Furthermore, we prove that the margin of errors introduced by random sampling can be controlled in a small range. Extensive experiments on eight real-life text datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed sampling-based approximate clustering method. In particular, our method shows merits in both effectiveness and efficiency on clustering performance.},

This makes it more challenging to find articles of interest for researchers. Consequently, a solution to this problem, scientific article recommendation, has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel article recommendation method called Citation-based scientific Article Recommendation (CAR). CAR combines the information of researchers' historical preferences and citation relations between articles. We take into account the fact that, not all pairwise articles with citation relations are highly relevant although researchers generally find articles of interest by searching citations. Therefore, in our proposed method, weak citation relations are first filtered out through an association mining technique using data on researchers' historical preferences. Then, these filtered citation relations are incorporated into a graph-based article ranking method for enhancing recommendation quality. Through a relevant real-world dataset, we evaluate our proposed method. Our experimental results verify that the proposed method significantly outperforms other existing baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

"Big Data" is on the covers of Science, Nature, the Economist, and Wired magazines, on the front pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. But despite the media hyperbole, as Christine Borgman points out in this examination of data and scholarly research, having the right data is usually better than having more data; little data can be just as valuable as big data. In many cases, there are no data -- because relevant data don't exist, cannot be found, or are not available. Moreover, data sharing is difficult, incentives to do so are minimal, and data practices vary widely across disciplines.

Borgman, an often-cited authority on scholarly communication, argues that data have no value or meaning in isolation; they exist within a knowledge infrastructure -- an ecology of people, practices, technologies, institutions, material objects, and relationships. After laying out the premises of her investigation -- six "provocations" mea t to inspire discussion about the uses of data in scholarship -- Borgman offers case studies of data practices in the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, and then considers the implications of her findings for scholarly practice and research policy. To manage and exploit data over the long term, Borgman argues, requires massive investment in knowledge infrastructures; at stake is the future of scholarship.

  abstract = {Tagging music signals with semantic labels such as genres, moods and instruments is important for content-based music retrieval and recommendation. While considerable effort has been made, automatic music annotation is still considered challenging due to the difficulty of extracting good audio features that capture the characteristics of different tags. To address this issue, we present in this letter two exemplar-based approaches that represent the content of a music clip by referring to a large set of unlabeled audio exemplars. The first approach represents a music clip by the set of audio exemplars that is highly correlated with the short-time feature vectors of the clip, whereas the second approach represents a music clip as sparse linear combinations of its short-time feature vectors over the audio exemplars. Music annotation is then performed by learning the relevance of the audio examples to different tags using labeled data. These two approaches effectively capitalize the availability of unlabeled data to explore the commonality of music signals to find out tag-specific acoustic patterns, without domain knowledge and feature design. Evaluation on the CAL10k music genre tagging dataset for tag-based music retrieval shows that, with thousands of unlabeled audio examples randomly drawn from the Million Song Dataset, the proposed approaches lead to remarkably higher precision rates than existing approaches.},

The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy. While the personalization algorithmis successful in both cases.},

Additionally, this study will test the hypothesis that - having domain experts working with non-experts using collaborative search systems would immensely increase the query success rates for non-expert users, and help them learn querying strategies over the course of time.

The main contributions of our work are that: (1) to efficiently make use of tags, social image tags are re-ranked according to the image content; (2) to obtain user preference, a User-Image-Tag model is constructed with tripartite graph according to the correlation among users, images and Topranking tags; (3) a personalized social recommendation system is implemented based on User-Image-Tag model.

There might be new songs, which create the cold-start problem, and the users' musical preference might change over time. Moreover, the user satisfaction of a recommender system may be related to factors other than accuracy. In light of these observations, we propose in this paper a novel evaluation framework that uses various time-based data splitting methods and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of recommender systems. Using millions of listening records collected from a commercial music streaming service, we compare the performance of collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) models with low-level audio features and semantic audio descriptors. Our evaluation shows that the CB model with semantic descriptors obtains a better trade-off among accuracy, novelty, diversity, freshness and popularity, and can nicely deal with the cold-start problems of new songs.},

  abstract  = {Cross-domain recommendation has attracted wide research interest which generally aims at improving the recommendation performance by alleviating the cold start problem in collaborative filtering based recommendation or generating a more comprehensive user profiles from multiple domains. In most previous cross-domain recommendation settings, explicit or implicit relationships can be easily established across different domains. However, many real applications belong to a more challenging setting: recommendation across heterogeneous domains without explicit relationships, where neither explicit user-item relations nor overlapping features exist between different domains. In this new setting, we need to (1) enrich the sparse data to characterize users or items and (2) bridge the gap caused by the heterogenous features in different domains. To overcome the first challenge, we proposed an optimized local tag propagation algorithm to generate descriptive tags for user profiling. For the second challenge, we proposed a semantic relatedness metric by mapping the heterogenous features onto their concept space derived from online encyclopedias. We conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets to justify the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract  = {In a recommender system, items can be rated across multiple fields by users with varying degrees of familiarity. Hence, the ratings in a recommender system should have different recommended weights. Ratings in fields where in the user has high or low familiarity should be given high or low recommended weights, respectively. However, current recommendation algorithms ignore this problem and use the ratings indiscriminately, thus affecting the accuracy of the recommendation system. In this paper, we provide a focused study of user-familiarity degree-aware recommendation and develop a user-familiarity degree-aware latent factor model for recommendations that considers both user familiarity and item features reflected by the tagging information. We also design a user-familiarity degree-aware probability matrix factorization model, which computes the degree of familiarity of a user with the items he/she has rated. By using the user-familiarity degree, different recommended weights are given to every rating to obtain precise recommendations. The experiment results on real-world datasets show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models and effectively improves the accuracy of the recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {The enormous success and diffusion that online social networks (OSNs) are encountering nowadays is vastly apparent. Users' social interactions now occur using online social media as communication channels; personal information and activities are easily exchanged both for recreational and business purposes in order to obtain social or economic advantages. In this scenario, OSNs are considered critical applications with respect to the security of users and their resources, for their characteristics alone: the large amount of personal information they manage, big economic upturn connected to their commercial use, strict interconnection among users and resources characterizing them, as well as user attitude to easily share private data and activities with strangers. In this book, we discuss three main research topics connected to security in online social networks: (i) trust management, because trust can be intended as a measure of the perception of security (in terms of risks/benefits) hat users in an OSN have with respect to other (unknown/little-known) parties; (ii) controlled information sharing, because in OSNs, where personal information is not only connected to user profiles, but spans across users' social activities and interactions, users must be provided with the possibility to directly control information flows; and (iii) identity management, because OSNs are subjected more and more to malicious attacks that, with respect to traditional ones, have the advantage of being more effective by leveraging the social network as a new medium for reaching victims. For each of these research topics, in this book we provide both theoretical concepts as well as an overview of the main solutions that commercial/non-commercial actors have proposed over the years. We also discuss some of the most promising research directions in these fields.},

  abstract = {Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, Web links, products, etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) method and the kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.},

Messages received by a user mainly depend on whom the user follows. Thus, recommending users with similar interests may improve the experience quality for information receiving. Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts. The experimental results of friend recommendations on Sina Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging sites in China, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

Previous works on social networks were focused mainly on a single network due to the lack of links from one network to the others. There are several ways to connect different social networks. One possible solution is to find out the same individual who owns accounts for different social networks simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on the problem of linking the same users across different social networks. We start from a basic solution based on profile comparison, which is then improved by considering additional social relationships, i.e., friends. Finally, we propose a two-phase clustering method to generate a social summary for each individual. The first phase is to select strongly-connected groups as seeds. The second phase is to assign non-seeds to the clusters based on the social structure and profiles. The final distributions over various clusters are regarded as the social summary. The experiments have been conducted on two real social networking datasets. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed (social summary) method, compared to the methods of profile comparison and person-name comparison.},

In order to leverage their extensive abilities, it is necessary to collect and organize them effectively. However, fundamental knowledge about seniors in the workplace is still lacking, in particular the types of workstyle preferred by this demographic and their opinions about an ICT-based workstyle are unknown. In addition, an effective method to estimate seniors' skills and knowledge in order to match them to appropriate jobs needs to be developed. In this study, we aim to clarify the work demands of seniors and then propose a method of analyzing their skills in order to match them to work profiles. First, a questionnaire survey was conducted with Japanese seniors. The results indicated that most of the participating seniors valued maintaining their health, achieving a feeling of accomplishment, getting to know one another, contributing to society, and personal growth, as strongly or moderately important to their work. The consciousness of an ICT-based work style was significantly higher in the participants who regarded personal growth and contribution to their colleagues as strongly important. Finally, we propose the concept of skill matching by means of similarity evaluations based on TF-IDF (term frequency - inverted document frequency) calculations in documents pertaining to worker information and work profiles. The results show that this method can be applicable to matching single senior workers with work profiles.},

Different from existing solutions which employ user profile or social network structure alone, in this paper, we proposed a novel joint solution named MapMe, which takes both user profile and social network structure feature into account, so that it can adapt more OSNs with more accurate results. MapMe first calculates user similarity via profile features with the Doc2vec method. Then, it evaluates user similarity by analyzing user’s ego network features. Finally, the profile features and ego network features were combined to measure the similarity of the users. Consequently, MapMe balances the two similarity factors to achieve goals in different platforms and scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted on the synthetic and real data sets, proving that MapMe outperforms the existing methods with 10% on average.},

Then, he needs a tailored information reflecting his current needs and interests in every period of time. This aims to provide a better adaptation while accessing the information space by integrating users' interests dynamic. Indeed, users' interests may change and become “outdated” through time. So, an interest judged as relevant in a period of time may fluctuate in the next period of time. Moreover, analysing the classic user behaviour to deduce his current interests is a difficult task. In fact, his behaviour isn't always reflecting his real interests. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enriching the user profile in an evolutionary environment such as a social network. The enrichment takes into account: i) the social behaviour and more precisely the tagging behaviour (that reflects user's interests) and ii) the temporal information (that reflects the dynamic evolution of users' interests). Our approach focus on the concept of temperature that reflects the importance of a resource in each period of time. This concept is used to infer common interests of users tagging the same “important” resource. The originality of our approach relies on combining information tags, users and resources in a way that guarantees a better enrichment for the social user profile. Our approach has been tested and evaluated with the Delicious social database and shows interesting precision values.},

Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation.},

Specifically, CrowdAPS leverages Twitter lists, which is a tool used by individual users to organize accounts that interest them on semantics. List meta-data, including list name and description, is generated from collective intelligence and can be used by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model to acquire semantic similarity between APIs and queries. Furthermore, CrowdAPS exploits list number to infer the popularity of APIs. The final search result relies on the integration of semantic similarity and popularity. Comprehensive experiment based on real-world datasets crawled from ProgrammableWeb and Twitter demonstrates the effectiveness of CrowdAPS.},

We tackle with the problem by introducing TBIL, a novel tagging-based approach to identity linkage among software communities. The essential idea of this approach is to employ skills (measured by tags), usernames and concerned topics of developers as hints, and to use a decision tree-based algorithm and another heuristic greedy matching algorithm to link user identities. We measure the effectiveness of TBIL on two well-known software communities, i.e., StackOverflow and Github. The results show that our method is feasible and practical in linking developer identities. In particular, the F-Score of our method is 0.15 higher than previous identity linkage methods in software communities.},

  abstract  = {Event-based social networks (EBSNs), such as Meetup and Plancast, which offer platforms for users to plan, arrange, and publish events, have gained increasing popularity and rapid growth. EBSNs capture not only the online social relationship, but also the offline interactions from offline events. They contain rich heterogeneous information, including multiple types of entities, such as users, events, groups and tags, and their interaction relations. Three recommendation tasks, namely recommending groups to users, recommending tags to groups, and recommending events to users, have been explored in three separate studies. However, none of the proposed methods can handle all the three recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a general graph-based model, called HeteRS, to solve the three recommendation problems on EBSNs in one framework. Our method models the rich information with a heterogeneous graph and considers the recommendation problem as a query-dependent node proximity problem. To address the challenging issue of weighting the influences between different types of entities, we propose a learning scheme to set the influence weights between different types of entities. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all the three recommendation tasks, and the learned influence weights help understanding user behaviors.},

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems have emerged as a prominent solution to speed up CDS. In this kind of distributed system, a particular interesting challenge refers to mechanisms employed to match user's interests and published contents. The efficacy of CDS depends on the expertise of publishers to properly describe contents, which comprises an important task to guarantee good quality of experience (QoE) to users. Massive attacks may harm CDS if countermeasure mechanisms are not considered to fight content pollution. The main objective of the thesis is to devise a mechanism to provide users a good QoE and reduce the effect of malicious interference. To achieve that, three main steps guided the research work presented in the thesis and summarized in this paper: (i) we proposed a novel strategy that operates conservatively to avoid wide pollution dissemination, (ii) we extended our previous solution to cope with the subjectivity regarding content descriptions, and last, (iii) we proposed a generic model to investigate massive attacks (including content pollution) and conservative approaches.},

Then, knowledge gap is defined both graphically and intuitively with the knowledge map. To bridge the knowledge gap, we design a graph-based method to explore some suitable knowledge paths, which can help a researcher to learn the requisite knowledge in accordance with cognition pattern.

However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, Para Fac, and Low-order tensor decompositions.

The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

However, there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve users' or groups of users' satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users' behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve users' experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a user's needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection.},

Firstly, we detect events from the photos textual annotations as well as visual features (e.g., timestamp, location); and then effectively identify events by considering the spreading effect of events in the spatio-temporal space. Secondly, we use these relationships among events (e.g., event spatial, temporal and content) for enhancing the precision of the algorithm. Finally, we rank events by analyzing relationships between them (e.g., locations, timestamps, tags) at different period of time. The experiments are conducted with two different approaches: (i) using a collected dataset (offline approach), and (ii) using a realtime dataset (online approach).},

In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective. A novel classifier-free video annotation framework is proposed by first retrieving visual duplicates and then suggesting representative tags. The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},

We conduct metric learning to learn a set of (hyper)category-specific metrics for all the tasks. By encouraging model sharing among tasks, more generalization power is acquired. Another advantage is the capability of simultaneous learning with semantic information and social tagging based on the multi-task learning framework, and thus they both benefit from the information provided by each other. Experiments demonstrate the advantages on applications including semantic categorization and automatic tagging compared with other popular metric learning approaches.},

By computing those features on a number of entity properties, we created a learning set and tested the performance of a number of well-known learning-to-rank algorithms.

However it also forms a huge barrier between customers and those songs people truely want, due to the difficulty to explore this large collections. In this paper, we propose a novel music playlist prediction algorithm to facilitate this process for users. This method captures the moods expressed by songs in playlist context and also models the nature of composing a playlist. With the help of captured moods, personalized predictions can be achieved. We offer two ways to represent these hidden song moods and the transitions between them. The empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of perplexity.},

  abstract  = {Defending against spam in tagging system is a very challenging task. This paper presents ReSpam, a novel reputation based mechanism of defending against tag spam in tagging systems. In ReSpam, timing behaviors and voting methods are introduced to defend tag spam. Each user has a global reputation which can increase or decrease after some judgement given bythe tagging system. When the system finds that the time between logging and posting is too short or the time between opening a webpage and posting a tag is too short, the reputations of all the users who post a tag of that kind will decrease. For a uncertain tag, the system requests some users to help to judge the quality of that uncertain tag. If the feedback shows that lots of users regard that tag as spam, all the users who post a tag of that kind will find their reputations lower than before. Otherwise, those users' reputations will increase. The advantage of ReSpam is its simple rationale and less computing compared to pairwise reputation based mechanism such as SpamClean and DSpam. The system ranks search result by the average reputation of annotators of each result. Experimental results show ReSpam can effectively resist tag spam and work better than some existing tag search schemes.},

Annotating documents rises as an interesting strategy to diminish the hard task of retrieving important documents from the Web. Annotations consist of associating metadata with text segments of a document, in order to facilitate its retrieval by search engines. Besides improving their performance, annotations enable an optimized indexation of documents. However, due to the huge amount of existing documents, the idea of generating document annotations is not a trivial task. This paper presents a proposal for automatically enriching documents with semantic annotations, where document terms are annotated according to a domain ontology. Currently there already exist some document annotation tools to automate this process. However, the main contribution of this work is focused on the ability of exploring the ontology inference capability and on the meta-annotation concept, which aim at providing users and automatic agents with a more powerful mechanism to retrieve information.},

Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques augments the capabilities of the platform without additional costs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition in MCS deployed over a fog computing platform which facilitates important operations like user recruitment and task completion. Proper data acquisition minimizes the monetary expenditure the platform sustains to recruit and compensate users and the energy they spend to sense and deliver data. We propose a new user recruitment policy called DSE (Distance, Sociability, Energy). The policy exploits three criteria: i) spatial distance between users and tasks, ii) user sociability, which is an estimate of the willingness of users to contribute to sensing tasks, and iii) remaining battery charge the devices. Performance evaluation is conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants with new metrics that assess the efficiency of the recruitment policy and the accuracy of task completion. Results reveal that the average number of recruited users improves by nearly 20% if compared to policies using only spatial distance as selection criterion.},

A fundamental problem is how to significantly improve the large-scale system's scalability to interconnect a large number of servers and meanwhile support various online services in cloud computing. One way is to deal with the challenge of potential mismatching between the network architecture and the data placement. To address this challenge, we present ANTELOPE, a scalable distributed data-centric scheme in cloud data centers, in which we systematically take into account both the property of network architecture and the optimization of data placement. The basic idea behind ANTELOPE is to leverage precomputation based data cube to support online cloud services. Since the construction of data cube suffers from the high costs of full materialization, we use a semantic-aware partial materialization solution to significantly reduce the operation and space overheads. Extensive experiments on real system implementations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

However, many real-world domains are currently left out of the social tagging phenomenon due to the lack of a wide-scale tagging-savvy audience - domains like the personal desktop, enterprise intranets, and digital libraries. Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement.},

The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

Three social factors, the influence and the activity of the target user, together with the coherence between users, are fused to improve the performance of proposed recommendation strategy. Experimental results show that, compared to the well-known PageRank-based algorithm, the proposed strategy performs much better in terms of precision and recall and it can effectively avoid a biased result caused by celebrity effect and zombie fans effect.},

Experimental results illustrate that our approach ISCF outperforms the average method and user-based CF.

  abstract  = {The rise of social media technologies has created new ways to seek and share information for millions of users worldwide, but also has presented new challenges for libraries in meeting users where they are within social spaces. From social networking sites such as Facebook and Google+, and microblogging platforms such as Twitter and Tumblr to the image and video sites of YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, and to geotagging sites such as Foursquare, libraries have responded by establishing footholds within a variety of social media platforms and seeking new ways of engaging with online users in social spaces. Libraries are also responding to new social review sites such as Yelp and Tripadvisor, awareness sites including StumbleUpon, Pinterest, Goodreads, and Reddit, and social question-and-answer (Q&A) sites such as Yahoo! Answers—sites which engage social media users in functions similar to traditional library content curation, readers' advisory, information and referral, and re erence services. Establishing a social media presence extends the library's physical manifestation into virtual space and increases the library's visibility, reach, and impact. However, beyond simply establishing a social presence for the library, a greater challenge is building effective and engaging social media sites that successfully adapt a library's visibility, voice, and presence to the unique contexts, audiences, and cultures within diverse social media sites. This lecture examines the research and theory on social media and libraries, providing an overview of what is known and what is not yet known about libraries and social media. Chapter 1 focuses on the social media environments within which libraries are establishing a presence, including how social media sites differ from each other, yet work together within a social ecosphere. Chapter 2 examines how libraries are engaging with users across a variety of social media platforms and the extent to which libraries are invo ved in using these different social media platforms, as well as the activities of libraries in presenting a social "self," sharing information, and interacting with users via social media. Chapter 3 explores metrics and measures for assessing the impact of the library's activity in social media sites. The book concludes with Chapter 4 on evolving directions for libraries and social media, including potential implications of new and emerging technologies for libraries in social spaces.},

Arguments are provided why the applications of the tags cannot be effectively pursued without a reasonable understanding of their semantic qualities. The identification scheme consists of a set of filters. The first is related with social consensus, user-count ratio, and n-gram properties of tags. The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out with an independent, smaller hand-annotated dataset, in which high agreement between the identification provided by the scheme and annotations was found.},

Discovering user communities from social networks have become one of the major challenges which help its members to interact with relevant people who have similar interests. Community detection approaches fall into two categories: the first one considers user' networks while the other utilizes usergenerated content. In this paper, a multi-layer community detection model based on identifying topics of interest from user published content is presented. This model applies Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine for modeling user's posts within a social network which yields to identify their topics of interest, and finally construct communities. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-layer model is measured using KL divergence which measures similarity between users of the same community. Experiments on the real Twitter dataset show that the proposed deep model outperforms traditional community detection models that directly maps users into corresponding communities using several baseline techniques.},

In analyzing large dataset with HCA, it is important to improve its efficiency. Motivated by the fact that small quantitative differences may not necessarily reflect changes of qualitative property, we report an interval-radial algorithm for HCA. By grouping data points within a neighborhood, the interval-radial algorithm is O(N^2) for both agglomerative and divisive approaches under an easy to satisfy weak condition. The algorithm can adaptively adjust radius during its execution. Furthermore, the algorithm provides flexibility to users for them to select initial radius and step size such that to produce customized output automatically. We report the algorithm, its analysis, and results of computational experiments on several benchmark datasets. Examples and illustrative dendrograms are included.},

The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf ·idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.},

Many community detection algorithms are designed to process undirected graphs (i.e., graphs with bidirectional edges) but many graphs on the Web - e.g. microblogging Web sites, trust networks or the Web graph itself - are often directed. Few community detection algorithms deal with directed graphs but we lack their experimental comparison. In this paper we evaluated some community detection algorithms across accuracy and scalability. A first group of algorithms (Label Propagation and Infomap) are explicitly designed to manage directed graphs while a second group (e.g., WalkTrap) simply ignores edge directionality; finally, a third group of algorithms (e.g., Eigenvector) maps input graphs onto undirected ones and extracts communities from the symmetrized version of the input graph. We ran our tests on both artificial and real graphs and, on artificial graphs, WalkTrap achieved the highest accuracy, closely followed by other algorithms; Label Propagation has outstanding performance in scalability on both artificial and real graphs. The Infomap algorithm showcased the best trade-off between accuracy and computational performance and, therefore, it has to be considered as a promising tool for Web Data Analytics purposes.},

From the system's perspective, hashtags play an important role in tweet retrieval, event detection, topic tracking, and advertising, etc. Annotating tweets with the right hashtags can lead to a better user experience. However, two problems remain unsolved during an annotation: (1) Before the user decides to create a new hashtag, is there any way to help her/him find out whether some related hashtags have already been created and widely used? (2) Different users may have different preferences for categorizing tweets. However, few work has been done to study the personalization issue in hashtag recommendation. To address the above problems, we propose a statistical model for personalized hashtag recommendation in this paper. With millions of <;tweet, hashtag> pairs being published everyday, we are able to learn the complex mappings from tweets to hashtags with the wisdom of the crowd. Two questions are answered in the model: (1) Different from traditional item recommendation data, users and tweets in Twitter have rich auxiliary information like URLs, mentions, locations, social relations, etc. How can we incorporate these features for hashtag recommendation? (2) Different hashtags have different temporal characteristics. Hashtags related to breaking events in the physical world have strong rise-and-fall temporal pattern while some other hashtags remain stable in the system. How can we incorporate hashtag related features to serve for hashtag recommendation? With all the above factors considered, we show that our model successfully outperforms existing methods on real datasets crawled from Twitter.},

In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a new approach based on the idea that combines user-based collaborative filtering techniques with transfer learning. The method alleviates the data sparsity problem by transferring the knowledge learned from dense data set to sparse ones. We use the data from a glasses site as the dense data set and the data from an underware site as the sparse one, experiments are conducted for evaluating the proposed method in this paper. Results show that our method can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the effect of user based collaborative filtering method.},

The evolution of the Web, from Web 1.0, where we were consumers of information, to a Web 2.0 where now we are producers and consumers of information, has allowed the Web becomes a huge database and in constant expansion. In these days much of the information published on the Web is published on social media, represented through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, to name only the most prominent. Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics, ranging from the length of text that can be used, the use of different forms to identify topics until reaching the reciprocity of relationship between the participants. For example Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called Tweets are exchanged, within the message can be used labels, called hashtags, to identify the subject of the message, the message also may include links to other resources that expand the original content or showing interesting information and the relationships between users are represented as non reciprocal relationships named "Following". The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this research through the use of linked data, that allow retrieving resources and link with other external sources, graphs databases that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis (SNA), technique to discover relevant information that goes beyond the individual properties. The scope of this paper is to use information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend Open Educational Resources in order to help with the learning process. The results obtained are a set of recommendations on users (identified as experts) and virtual communities (lists of Twitter users) and related events, according to the learning needs described as tags.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

Meanwhile, the data sparsity reduces the accuracy of the recommendation system.

Creating richly detailed digitized reproductions of museum holdings can stimulate the social media dialogue between museum and visitor. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of reproducing traditional costumes using digital technology. For this experiment, we selected a woman's robe and a man's ensemble of the Rococo era of the 18th century. Using historical reference material we first analyzed the design features of the silhouette, and the fabrics, hairdos and accessories of the period.

  abstract  = {Folksonomy, tag, bookmark and social bookmarking are all concepts that refer to recollection in information retrieval (IR). Recollection can be defined as the effort needed to recall an even, an idea or a resource. In IR, when locating an interesting resource, a user can tag it in order to "memorize" it and retrieve it later. The user chooses the tags according to his/her needs or centers of interest. While previous work has addressed the problem of tag exploitation, to our knowledge, an important dimension is missing. None has focused on the tagging activity itself when considering the users point of view. An important open question is the following: will a user be able to remember tags he/she associated with a document in the past in order to retrieve a document again? Our paper tackles this problem. Considering a user study that implied 32 participants, we evaluate some elements (age, time...) that impacts the recognition and the recall of tags used in the past. This result is important specifically as it can be used in order to optimize personalized systems (e.g. user profiling, tag exploitation...).},

We show in this paper how a Hasse diagram is an efficient visualization strategy for eliciting different groups and navigating through them. However, we do not limit this strategy to these traditional uses. Instead we show how it can also be used for assisting in indexing new photos. Indexing consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a novel way of building the Hasse diagram. To validate the approach, we present some tests conducted with a sample of users that confirm the interest of this organization, visualization and indexation approach. Finally, we conclude by considering scalability, the possibility to extract social networks and automatically create personalised albums.},

Although tag co-occurrence has recently become a hot research topic, many studies mainly focus on how to produce the personalized recommendation leveraging the tag co-occurrence relationship and most of them are considered in a homogeneous network. So far, few studies pay attention to how to predict tag co-occurrence relationship across heterogeneous networks. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel two-step prediction approach. First, weight path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-occurrence relationships. Experiments are performed on real-world dataset, the Flickr network, with comprehensive measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that weight path-based heterogeneous topological features have substantial advantages over commonly used link prediction approaches in predicting co-occurrence relations in information networks.},

Such personalisation is required in order to provide an adaptive Web to users, where content fits their preferences, background and current interests, making the Web more social and relevant. Current techniques analyse user activities on social media systems and collect structured or unstructured sets of entities representing users' interests. These sets of entities, or user profiles of interest, are often missing the semantics of the entities in terms of: (i) popularity and temporal dynamics of the interests on the Social Web and (ii) abstractness of the entities in the real world. State of the art techniques to compute these values are using specific knowledge bases or taxonomies and need to analyse the dynamics of the entities over a period of time. Hence, we propose a real-time, computationally inexpensive, domain independent model for concepts of interest composed of: popularity, temporal dynamics and specificity. We describe and evaluate a novel algorithm for computing specificity leveraging the semantics of Linked Data and evaluate the impact of our model on user profiles of interests.},

Consumers who significantly influence the opinions and decisions of others through communicative acts are called opinion leaders. These leaders usually capture the most representative opinions and play a crucial role in electronic word-of-mouth. Since opinion leaders have different expertise and interests, they are typically topic sensitive. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of identifying topic-sensitive opinion leaders in online review communities, and present a two-stage approach. In Stage I, we derive opinion leaders' interest from their tags. In Stage II, we rank leaders according to not only the link structure of networks but also opinion leaders' personal expertise and interests. A preliminary experiment on real-world data indicates the proposed approach is effective.},

Some people have more than one calling identity for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Discovering multiple identities of an individual can be important for fraud detection, detection of coordinated criminals, collaborative recommendations, and analyses of complete social graph of an individual. To address the challenge of finding identities that belong to a single individual, this paper describes ID-CONNECT, an approach for linking multiple identities of an individual based on that individual's social call graph and call behavior. The approach is based on the assumption that similarity between identities can be better estimated by using both call network and call behavior of identities towards their friends and that the more similar the weighted call graph of two identities, the higher is the similarity between them. ID-CONNECT is a two-step approach: 1) it estimates similarity between identities by incorporating call rate and duration, and 2) it generates sets of candidate identities for each target identity. We experimentally evaluate our approach on different random graph models and compare its performance against other approaches. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly reduces candidate set size (up to 70%) while achieving comparable true positive rate.},

We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information.},

  abstract  = {A social tagging system, such as del.icio.us and Flickr, allows users to annotate resources (e.g., web pages and photos) with text descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable information for searching, mining, and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result, while some highly-popular resources are over-tagged, most of the resources are under-tagged. Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-based techniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tag specific resources, how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcing environment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this question by observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been tagged a sufficient number of times. We formalize the concepts of tagging quality (TQ) and tagging stability (TS) in measuring the quality of a resource's tag description. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed “budget” (i.e., the amount of money paid for tagging resources). This solution decides the amount of rewards that should be invested on each resource in order to maximize tagging stability. We further propose a few simple, practical, and efficient incentive allocation strategies. On a dataset from del.icio.us, our best strategy provides resources with a close-to-optimal gain in tagging stability.},

However, Rank SVM suffers from the critical problem of long training time needed to deal with a huge number of pairs. In this paper, we propose a data selection technique, Pruned Rank SVM, that selects the most informative pairs before training.

  abstract = {Social tagging becomes increasingly important to organize and search large-scale community-contributed photos on social websites. To facilitate generating high-quality social tags, tag recommendation by automatically assigning relevant tags to photos draws particular research interest. In this paper, we focus on the personalized tag recommendation task and try to identify user-preferred, geo-location-specific as well as semantically relevant tags for a photo by leveraging rich contexts of the freely available community-contributed photos. For users and geo-locations, we assume they have different preferred tags assigned to a photo, and propose a subspace learning method to individually uncover the both types of preferences. The goal of our work is to learn a unified subspace shared by the visual and textual domains to make visual features and textual information of photos comparable. Considering the visual feature is a lower level representation on semantics than the textual information, we adopt a progressive learning strategy by additionally introducing an intermediate subspace for the visual domain, and expect it to have consistent local structure with the textual space. Accordingly, the unified subspace is mapped from the intermediate subspace and the textual space respectively. We formulate the above learning problems into a united form, and present an iterative optimization with its convergence proof. Given an untagged photo with its geo-location to a user, the user-preferred and the geo-location-specific tags are found by the nearest neighbor search in the corresponding unified spaces. Then we combine the obtained tags and the visual appearance of the photo to discover the semantically and visually related photos, among which the most frequent tags are used as the recommended tags. Experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Flickr verify the effectivity of the proposed solution.},

Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

Strong information protection can be a competitive advantage, but preserving privacy is a real challenge when people use the mobile apps in the smartphone. If they are too lax with privacy preserving, important or sensitive information could be lost. If they are too tight with privacy, making users jump through endless hoops to access the data they need to get their work done, productivity can nosedive. Thus, striking a balance between privacy and usability in mobile applications can be difficult. Leveraging the privacy permission settings in mobile operating systems, our basic idea to address this issue is to provide proper recommendations about the settings so that the users can preserve their sensitive information and maintain the usability of apps. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive recommendation system to implement this idea, which can crowdsource users’ privacy permission settings and generate the recommendations for them accordingly. Besides, our system allows users to provide feedback to revise the recommendations for getting better performance and adapting different scenarios. For the evaluation, we collected users’ preferences from 382 participants on Amazon Technical Turks and released our system to users in the real world for 10 days. According to the study, our system can make appropriate recommendations which can meet participants’ privacy expectation and mobile apps’ usability.},

Motivated by the observation that media contents are usually shared frequently in online communities and thus have a lot of social diffusion records, we propose a novel media annotating approach depending on these social diffusion records instead of metadata. The basic assumption is that the social diffusion records reflect the common interests (CI) between users, which can be analyzed for generating annotations. With this assumption, we present a novel CI-based social diffusion model and translate the automatic annotating task into the CI-based diffusion maximization (CIDM) problem. Moreover, we propose to solve the CIDM problem through two optimization tasks, corresponding to the training and test stages in supervised learning. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach can effectively generate high quality annotations, and thus demonstrate the capability of social diffusion analysis in annotating media.},

These user-generated tags can represent users' interests more concise and closer to human understanding. Interests will change over time. Thus, how to describe users' interests and interests transfer path become a big challenge for personalized recommendation systems. In this approach, we propose a variable-length time interval division algorithm and user interest model based on time interval. Then, in order to draw users' interests transfer path over a specific time period, we suggest interest transfer model. After that, we apply a classical community partition algorithm in our approach to separate users into communities. Finally, we raise a novel method to measure users' similarities based on interest transfer model and provide personalized tag recommendation according to similar users' interests in their next time intervals. Experimental results demonstrate the higher precision and recall with our approach than classical user-based collaborative filtering methods.},

We proposed approaches to infer user interest on Social media where often multi-modal data (text, image etc.) exists. We use user-generated data from Pinterest.com as a natural expression of users' interests. We consider each pin (image-text pair) as a category label that represents a broad user interest, since users collect images that they like on the social media platform and often assign a category label. This task is useful beyond Pinterest because most user-generated data on the Web is not necessarily readily categorized into interest labels. In addition to predicting users' interests, our main contribution is exploiting a multi-modal space composed of images and text. This is a natural approach since humans express their interests with a combination of modalities. Exploiting multi-modal spaces in this context has received little attention in the literature. We performed eleven experiments using the state-of-the-art image and textual representations, such as convolutional neural networks, word embeddings, and bags of visual and textual words. Our experimental results show that in fact jointly processing image and text increases the overall interest classification accuracy, when compared to uni-modal representations (i.e., using only text or using only images).},

  abstract  = {In autonomous environment (such as P2P, ad hoc, social networks and so on), all the rational individuals make independent decisions to maximize their profits. However, many interactions among individuals can be modeled as Prisoner's Dilemma game, which suppresses the emergence of cooperation. In order to provide scalable and robust services in such systems, incentive mechanisms need to be introduced. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism called recommendation incentive mechanism based on evolutionary dynamics(RIMBED). In our RIMBED system, players who pay an additional cost for recommendation service not only can get the information of the opponents, but also can have a higher probability to interact with cooperative individuals. Using the replicator dynamics equations in evolutionary game theory, we mathematically analyze the robustness and effectiveness of our RIMBED system. Meanwhile, simulation experiments can also validate our mathematical analysis. In our RIMBED system, players have three alternative strategies: always cooperative(ALLC), always defective(ALLD) and rational cooperative(RC). No one strategy can dominate the others forever and all the three strategies can survive in our system. When we bring in population invasion and a small mutation, our system can still work at an excellent level.},

  abstract = {In recommender systems user preferences can be fairly dynamic, as users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users.},

Historically the emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance scholars”. In today's world, most of the significant problems are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending "giftwrapping" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century. The conceptual framework is illustrated by specific developments of social-technical environments that we have designed and evaluated including: collaborative, domain-oriented design environments, environments created by mass collaboration, and courses-as-seeds.},

  abstract  = {With the permission of annotating blog posts with tags, tags has become one of the most important resources used to describe blogger features. However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.},

We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves, compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities. Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics.

  abstract  = {Owing to the dynamics of the business environment in which organizations must adapt to changes quickly, the information systems have recently had to adapt to new situations so that they can keep adding value efficiently and effectively. In the light of this scenario, a new discipline called Service-oriented Systems Engineering (SOSE) has emerged in the academic scene and this has highlighted the disciplined, systematic and quantified development of Service-oriented Computing systems. This discipline is divided into other sub-disciplines, one of these sub-disciplines is Service-oriented Requirements Engineering (SORE) and is concerned with defining processes and methodologies to address the question of services requirements from two different perspectives: service consumers and service providers. In the context of SORE, this paper proposes a WS&i*-RGPS approach that explores some alternatives to the descriptions proposed by the Role, Goal, Process and Service (RGPS) metamodels - an approach in SORE. This involves a new definition that seeks to incorporate the advantages of other models -- established in the literature - with RGPS. Accordingly, this new approach outlines the use of the i* framework to describe the Role and Goal layers and shows the use of WS-BPEL/WSDL to describe the process and service layers. The use of the i* framework sets out the goals for managing different aspects of the systems specification. Among its advantages are stability, support in the detection of conflicts, analysis and negotiation. WS-BPEL/WSDL is chosen because of its maturity and widespread use in the state of practice, which increases the chance of this new approach being adopted by industry.},

PerSAR hybridizes the social and personality behaviours of smart conference attendees. Our recommendation methodology mainly aims to employ an algorithmic framework that computes the personality similarities and tie strengths of conference attendees so that recommendations can be generated for them using a relevant dataset.

This formulation allows for decoupling the representation size from the number of used codewords, as well as for better modeling the feature distribution using a separate trainable scaling parameter for each RBF neuron. The resulting network, called retrieval-oriented neural BoF (RN-BoF), is trained using regular back propagation and allows for fast extraction of compact image representations. It is demonstrated that the RN-BoF model is capable of: 1) increasing the object encoding and retrieval speed; 2) reducing the extracted representation size; and 3) increasing the retrieval precision. A symmetry-aware spatial segmentation technique is also proposed to further reduce the encoding time and the storage requirements and allows the method to efficiently scale to large datasets. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques using five different image datasets, including the large-scale YouTube Faces database.},

We also found that our method performs well on sparse networks and that the information dynamic influences more the quality of our proposed time-aware method than the relationships dynamic while building the social profile on Twitter.

Such paradigms are based on either categorical or dimensional models. The interest in dimensional models has recently grown a great deal, as they define a semantic relation between concepts through graded descriptions. One problem that affects semantic descriptions is the ambiguity that often arises from using the same descriptor in different contexts. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is important to model and address polysemy, which is the property of words to take on different meanings depending on the use-context. In this paper we propose a Dimensional Contextual Semantic Model for defining semantic relations among descriptors in a context-aware fashion. This model is here used for developing a semantic music search engine. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we compare this engine with two systems that are based on different description models.},

Till recently, contacts and social relationships were hard to capture and manage by software and, thus, it was infeasible to use them to empower the operation of software. The emergence of social networks made it possible to realise a new kind of software mediated social relationships which would enable what we call "socially-augmented operation". In this position paper, we propose socially-augmented software, which can benefit from network of contacts of users including individuals and organizations to fulfil their requirements. We articulate our view and discuss fundamental concepts of this new paradigm. A set of research challenges to better enable socially-augmented operations in software development will be also presented in the discussion.},

The contextual data is defined by the users in the form of rules and RuleML [1] is chosen as a rule based language.

The usual largeness of these collections requires a vast endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually. As an approach to effectively produce an automated classification of resources, we consider the immense amounts of annotations provided by users on social tagging systems in the form of bookmarks. In this paper, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags to perform a social classification of resources. For this purpose, we have created three large-scale social tagging data sets including tagging data for different types of resources, webpages and books. Those resources are accompanied by categorization data from sound expert-driven taxonomies. We analyze the characteristics of the three social tagging systems and perform an analysis on the usefulness of social tags to perform a social classification of resources that resembles the classification by experts as much as possible. We analyze six different representations using tags and compare to other data sources by using three different settings of SVM classifiers. Finally, we explore combinations of different data sources with tags using classifier committees to best classify the resources.},

A well-formed representation of location knowledge is desired to cater to the need of location sensing, browsing, navigation and querying. In this paper, we aim to study the semantics of point-of-interest (POI) by exploiting the abundant heterogeneous user generated content (UGC) from different social networks. Our idea is to explore the text descriptions, photos, user check-in patterns, and venue context for location semantic similarity measurement. We argue that the venue semantics play an important role in user check-in behavior. Based on this argument, a unified POI recommendation algorithm is proposed by incorporating venue semantics as a regularizer. In addition to deriving user preference based on user-venue check-in information, we place special emphasis on location semantic similarity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of location semantic similarity and location recommendation over a real world dataset collected from Foursquare and Instagram. Experimental results show that the UGC information can well characterize the venue semantics, which help to improve the recommendation performance.},

However, the output result has less stability and the quality of the output communities still remains to be improved. Therefore, we propose a novel core-leader based label propagation algorithm for community detection called CLBLPA. Firstly, we find core leaders of potential community by using a greedy method. Then we utilize the label influence potential to guide the process of label propagation. Thus we can accelerate the convergence of algorithm and improve the stability of the output.

SVAAs extend VAAs by providing (a) community-based recommendations, (b) comparison of users' political opinions, and (c) a channel of user communication. In addition, SVAAs enriched with data mining modules, can operate as citizen sensors recording the sentiment of the electorate on issues and candidates. Drawing on VAA datasets generated by the Preference Matcher research consortium, we evaluate the results of the first VAA-Choose4Greece-which incorporated social voting features and was launched during the landmark Greek national elections of 2012. We demonstrate how an SVAA can provide community based features and, at the same time, serve as a citizen sensor.

In contrast with the co-located situation however, acquiring and maintaining sufficient awareness is more difficult. Therefore technological support is developed to assist them with this. However, such support walks a fine line: if it provides too little information software engineers will not be able to collaborate effectively, yet if it provides too much, an information overload can occur. To further complicate matters, the information needs of software engineers dynamically change based on their current activity, context and focus. Therefore we assist tool developers by investigating and reporting on the prioritization of information for distributed software engineers based on their current activity and status. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the findings by describing how to apply them in a support tool for distributed software engineers.},

  abstract = {Research project selection is an important task for government and private research funding agencies. When a large number of research proposals are received, it is common to group them according to their similarities in research disciplines. The grouped proposals are then assigned to the appropriate experts for peer review. Current methods for grouping proposals are based on manual matching of similar research discipline areas and/or keywords. However, the exact research discipline areas of the proposals cannot often be accurately designated by the applicants due to their subjective views and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, rich information in the proposals' full text can be used effectively. Text-mining methods have been proposed to solve the problem by automatically classifying text documents, mainly in English. However, these methods have limitations when dealing with non-English language texts, e.g., Chinese research proposals. This paper presents a novel ontology-based text-mining approach to cluster research proposals based on their similarities in research areas. The method is efficient and effective for clustering research proposals with both English and Chinese texts. The method also includes an optimization model that considers applicants' characteristics for balancing proposals by geographical regions. The proposed method is tested and validated based on the selection process at the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The results can also be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research project selection processes in other government and private research funding agencies.},

Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics; for example, Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called tweets are exchanged. The message labels, called hashtags, can be used to identify the subject of the message. The message may also include links to other resources that expand the original content or show interesting information. Another kind of information present in Twitter is the relationship between users, the most common of which is a non-reciprocal relationship named “following.” The scope of this paper is to use the information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend open educational resources, which will be used in the StartUp project. The StartUp project (intelligent training needs assessment and open educational resources to foster entrepreneurship) is co-funded with support from the European Commission under the Lifelong Learning Programme, which has a specific objective to provide effective open educational resources corresponding to individual learning needs. The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this paper through the use of linked data that allow retrieving resources and link them with other external sources, graphs that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis, a technique used to discover relevant information that goes beyond individual properties. The results obtained are a set of recommendations about users (identified as experts), hashtags (thematically related), and URLs (digital resources), according to the main competence areas defined by StartUp.

However, the noisy or incomplete correspondence between the images and tags prohibits them from being leveraged for precise image retrieval and effective management. To tackle the problem of tag refinement, we propose a method of Ranking based Multi-correlation Tensor Factorization (RMTF), to jointly model the ternary relations among user, image, and tag, and further to precisely reconstruct the user-aware image-tag associations as a result. Since the user interest or background can be explored to eliminate the ambiguity of image tags, the proposed RMTF is believed to be superior to the traditional solutions, which only focus on the binary image-tag relations. During the model estimation, we employ a ranking based optimization scheme to interpret the tagging data, in which the pair-wise qualitative difference between positive and negative examples is used, instead of the point-wise 0/1 confidence. Specifically, the positive examples are directly decided by the observed user-image-tag interrelations, while the negative ones are collected with respect to the most semantically and contextually irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on a benchmark Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for tag refinement. We also show attractive performances on two potential applications as the by-products of the ternary relation analysis.},

These systems use ranks or tags each user assign to different resources to make predictions. Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents, tag, organize, share and search for contents, are becoming more popular. These social tagging systems have a lot of valuable information, but the data expansion in them is very fast and this has led to the need for recommender systems that will predict what each user may like or need make these suggestions to them. One of the problems in these systems is: “how much can we rely on the similar users, are they trustworthy?”. In this article we use trust metric, which we conclude from users' tagging behavior, beside similarities to give suggestions. Results show considering trust in a collaborative system can lead to better performance in generating suggestions.},

In this chapter, information search on the Internet is used to illustrate how a theoretical framework of these two conditions can assist our understanding of cognitive search. Discussion begins with information foraging theory (IFT), which predicts how general symbolic structures may exist in an information environment and how the searcher may use these structures to search for information. A computational model called SNIF-ACT (developed based on IFT) is then presented and provides a good match to online information search for specific target information. Because a further component important to cognitive search is the ability to detect and learn useful structures in the environment, discussion follows on how IFT can be extended to explain search behavior that involves incremental learning of the search environment. Illustration is provided on how different forms of semantic structures may exist in the World Wide Web, and how human searchers can learn from these structures to improve their search. Finally, the SNIFACT model is extended to characterize directed and exploratory information foraging behavior in information environments.},

Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

On testing, the prediction paths of a given test example may be required to end at leaf nodes of the label hierarchy. This is called mandatory leaf node prediction (MLNP) and is particularly useful, when the leaf nodes have much stronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes. However, while there have been a lot of MLNP methods in hierarchical multiclass classification, performing MLNP in hierarchical multilabel classification is difficult. In this paper, we propose novel MLNP algorithms that consider the global label hierarchy structure. We show that the joint posterior probability over all the node labels can be efficiently maximized by dynamic programming for label trees, or greedy algorithm for label DAGs. In addition, both algorithms can be further extended for the minimization of the expected symmetric loss. Experiments are performed on real-world MLNP data sets with label trees and label DAGs. The proposed method consistently outperforms other hierarchical and flat multilabel classification methods.},

This paper employs REP Tree, Naïve bayes Multinomial Updateable, Complement Naïve bayes and Classification via Clustering algorithms for the classification of the datasets in online social networks like Hi5, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Live Journal etc. Moreover, on the basis of parameters like TP rate, FP rate etc., the best algorithm for the classification of malicious and legitimate users for analyzing users' behavior in heterogeneous online social networks is selected.},

Academic recommendation services have been developed to help researchers with their literature search, many of which only provide a text-based search functionality. Such services are suitable for a first-level bibliographic search; however, they lack the benefits of today's recommendation engines. In this paper, we identify three important properties that an academic recommendation service could provide for better literature search: personalization, scalability, and exploratory search. With these objectives in mind, we present a web service called theadvisor which helps the users build a strong bibliography by extending the document set obtained after a first-level search. Along with an efficient and personalized recommendation algorithm, the service also features result diversification, relevance feedback, visualization for exploratory search. We explain the design criteria and rationale we employed to make the theadvisor a useful and scalable web service with a thorough evaluation.},

Yet crowd labelers are often noisy, inaccurate, and have limited labeling knowledge, and worst of all, they act independently without seeking complementary knowledge from each other to improve labeling performance. In this paper, we propose a Self-Taught Active Learning (STAL) paradigm, where imperfect labelers are able to learn complementary knowledge from one another to expand their knowledge sets and benefit the underlying active learner. We employ a probabilistic model to characterize the knowledge of each labeler through which a weak labeler can learn complementary knowledge from a stronger peer. As a result, the self-taught active learning process eventually helps achieve high classification accuracy with minimized labeling costs and labeling errors.},

SNPs have two unique characteristics: frequent content update and small world phenomenon. However, existing works are not able to support these two features simultaneously. To address this problem, we develop a general framework to enable real time personalized top-k query. Our framework is based on a general ranking function that incorporates time freshness, social relevance and textual similarity. To ensure efficient update and query processing, there are two key challenges. The first is to design an index structure that is update-friendly while supporting instant query processing. The second is to efficiently compute the social relevance in a complex graph. To address these challenges, we first design a novel 3D cube inverted index to support efficient pruning on the three dimensions simultaneously. Then we devise a cube based threshold algorithm to retrieve the top-k results, and propose several pruning techniques to optimize the social distance computation, whose cost dominates the query processing. Furthermore, we optimize the 3D index via a hierarchical partition method to enhance our pruning on the social dimension. Extensive experimental results on two real world large datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of our proposed solution.},

Genre classification is especially interesting in the domain of narrative content which is characterized by a large number of ambiguous and overlapping categories. The rise in popularity of social tagging systems forms a rich source of input information which could be harnessed for this task. In this paper we investigate two different information folksonomy sources for the movie domain namely: keywords and tags, the first of which is user annotated and expert monitored whereas the latter is non-monitored. A comparison is performed to assess the efficacy of both sources in solving this multi-label classification problem and it is found that the in spite of being expert monitored and better structured, keywords are worse predictors of the genres of movies than tags in most cases.},

Many methods and techniques have been proposed for image annotation in the last decade and they have shown reasonable performance on standard datasets. Great progress has been made especially in recent couple of years with the development of deep learning models for image content analysis and extraction of content-based concept labels. However, concept objects labels are much more friendly to machine than to users. We consider that more relevant and user-friendly visual labels need to include “context” descriptors. In this study we explore the possibilities to leverage social media content as a resource for visual labeling. We developed a tag extraction system that applies heuristic rules and term weighting method to extract image tags from associated Tweet. The system retrieves tweet-image pairs from public Twitter accounts, analyzes the Tweet, and generates labels for the images. We elaborate on different visual labeling methods, tag analysis and tag refinement methods.},

Moreover, this leads to alleviate some of the problems regarding the use of a natural vocabulary in a faceted classification.

We heavily rely on search engines but most existing search tools are key-word based and they often return search results with low precision and recall. The emerging semantic tagging technology provides an automatic way to generate semantic tags from text. It has drawn more and more interest from text mining research communities. It is critical to study how to utilize semantic tags to improve text mining including clustering, which helps users to enhance their experience of searching and browsing documents. Unfortunately, most previous works on text clustering merely based on content information. A few recent researches take user-generated tags into account, however user generated tags are often noisy, inconsistent, redundant and lack of semantic information and hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a Semantic Text Mining (STeM) framework to generate semantic tags for given documents and then utilize the semantic tags to improve text clustering. Different from the previous works, we represent a document by a combination of domains and high quality noun phrases. We investigate the performance of our methods in two different datasets and the results are evaluated by normalized mutual information. Experiment results demonstrated that our proposed method substantially outperformed the traditional Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) term vector based clustering. We find that incorporating semantic information into document representation is critical to improve the performance of text clustering.},

A number of computational models are developed to evaluate the accuracy of different content or context cues in predicting emotional state, using 40,000 pieces of music listening records collected from the social blogging website LiveJournal. Our study shows that it is feasible to computationally model the latent structure underlying music listening and mood regulation. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the content-based and context-based models attains 0.5462 and 0.6851, respectively.

Consumers were assumed to communicate with other consumers selectively using one of three policies: random selection, similar-level selection, and higher-level selection. A basic simulation showed that the most effective policy for selecting communication partners depends on the characteristics of the goods under consideration. An agent-based simulation showed that an effective word-of-mouth policy also depends on the characteristics of the goods under consideration.

In this sense, the goal of this paper is to propose a collaborative infrastructure for the development of DSLs where end-users have a direct and active participation in the evolution of the language.

We believe that for greater progress to be made, we must go beyond tags that merely describe objects that are visually represented in the image, towards more user-centric and subjective notions such as emotion, sentiment, and preferences. We focus on the notion of user preferences and show that the order that users list tags on images is correlated to the order of preference over the tags that they provided for the image. While this observation is not completely surprising, to our knowledge, we are the first to explore this aspect of user tagging behavior systematically and report empirical results to support this observation. We argue that this observation can be exploited to help advance the image tagging (and related) communities. Our contributions include: 1.) conducting a user study demonstrating this observation, 2.) collecting a dataset with user tag preferences explicitly collected.},

  abstract  = {This book is the third of a three-part series on taxonomies, and covers putting your taxonomy into use in as many ways as possible to maximize retrieval for your users. Chapter 1 suggests several items to research and consider before you start your implementation and integration process. It explores the different pieces of software that you will need for your system and what features to look for in each. Chapter 2 launches with a discussion of how taxonomy terms can be used within a workflow, connecting two—or more—taxonomies, and intelligent coordination of platforms and taxonomies. Microsoft SharePoint is a widely used and popular program, and I consider their use of taxonomies in this chapter. Following that is a discussion of taxonomies and semantic integration and then the relationship between indexing and the hierarchy of a taxonomy. Chapter 3 (“How is a Taxonomy Connected to Search?”) provides discussions and examples of putting taxonomies into use i practical applications. It discusses displaying content based on search, how taxonomy is connected to search, using a taxonomy to guide a searcher, tools for search, including search engines, crawlers and spiders, and search software, the parts of a search-capable system, and then how to assemble that search-capable system. This chapter also examines how to measure quality in search, the different kinds of search, and theories on search from several famous theoreticians—two from the 18th and 19th centuries, and two contemporary. Following that is a section on inverted files, parsing, discovery, and clustering. While you probably don’t need a comprehensive understanding of these concepts to build a solid, workable system, enough information is provided for the reader to see how they fit into the overall scheme. This chapter concludes with a look at faceted search and some possibilities for search interfaces. Chapter 4, “Implementing a Taxonomy in a Database or on Website,” starts where many content systems really should—with the authors, or at least the people who create the content. This chapter discusses matching up various groups of related data to form connections, data visualization and text analytics, and mobile and e-commerce applications for taxonomies. Finally, Chapter 5 presents some educated guesses about the future of knowledge organization. Table of Contents: List of Figures / Preface / Acknowledgments / On Your Mark, Get Ready …. WAIT!

  abstract = {Medical information retrieval plays an increasingly important role to help physicians and domain experts to better access medical-related knowledge and information, and support decision making. Integrating the medical knowledge bases has the potential to improve the information retrieval performance through incorporating medical domain knowledge for relevance assessment. However, this is not a trivial task due to the challenges to effectively utilize the domain knowledge in the medical knowledge bases. In this paper, we proposed a novel medical information retrieval system with a two-stage query expansion strategy, which is able to effectively model and incorporate the latent semantic associations to improve the performance. This system consists of two parts. First, we applied a heuristic approach to enhance the widely used pseudo relevance feedback method for more effective query expansion, through iteratively expanding the queries to boost the similarity score between queries and documents. Second, to improve the retrieval performance with structured knowledge bases, we presented a latent semantic relevance model based on tensor factorization to identify semantic association patterns under sparse settings. These identified patterns are then used as inference paths to trigger knowledge-based query expansion in medical information retrieval. Experiments with the TREC CDS 2014 data set: 1) showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly better than the baseline system and the systems reported in TREC CDS 2014 conference, and is comparable with the state-of-the-art systems and 2) demonstrated the capability of tensor-based semantic enrichment methods for medical information retrieval tasks.},

We then carry out an experiment to investigate the tagging practices of 28 student analysts in vetting requirements-to-source-code trace matrices.

The proposed recommender system consists of three modules including relevance module, quality module and integration module. The relevance module is developed to measure the relationship of an automobile exhibition and a visitor, while the quality module is constructed to analyze the quality of each automobile exhibition. The integration module is to combine two modules above for appropriate automobile exhibition. The proposed approach is well validated using a real world dataset, and compared with several baseline models. Our experimental results indicate that in terms of the well-known evaluation metrics, the proposed method can achieves more useful and feasible recommendation results, and our finding highlights that the proposed method can help both visitors to find a more appropriate automobile exhibition halls, and manage officers to reduce more management cost.},

The recommendations are based on the principles of content-based filtering. Such recommendations are complimented with Bayesian Inference based domain reputation meta-information to strengthen the veracity information of the recommended traces. Using actual long-term and short-term perfSONAR traces, we analyze recommendation results and show: a) how the content-based filter recommends the most pertinent traces based on their attributes, and b) the time-variant characteristics of domain reputation. Finally, using synthetic traces, we show the effectiveness of our proposed measurements recommendation scheme in accurately identifying anomaly events for an exemplar use case, and also show how our content filter based recommendation scheme performs better in terms of false alarms in comparison to: a) recommendations that consider partial trace features for filtering, and b) greedy recommendation approaches based on random trace selection.},

  abstract  = {Social media has long been a popular resource for sentiment analysis and data mining. In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.},

  abstract  = {Recommender systems are widely used in today's online applications. Traditional rating-oriented methods predict user ratings on items, but they fail to capture user preference among different items. This paper regards recommendation problem as a ranking task and proposes a new ranking-oriented collaborative filtering framework based on ranking aggregation methods. In this framework, recommendation lists are generated according to item rankings given by users who are similar to the target user. Then, a two-step method called BordaRank is proposed to further explain the framework. The method first uses item collaborative filtering to predict unknown ratings and then uses Borda count method to aggregate item rankings of neighbors. Finally, BordaRank is modified as a pure ranking-oriented method, which could be directly applied on the sparse rating matrix without rating prediction as an intermediate step. The methods are evaluated on real world movie rating data. Experimental results show that BordaRank improves the precision and recall of original rating-oriented methods and modified BordaRank also outperforms traditional methods.},

  abstract  = {Graph classification is becoming increasingly popular due to the rapidly rising applications involving data with structural dependency. The wide spread of the graph applications and the inherent complex relationships between graph objects have made the labels of the graph data expensive and/or difficult to obtain, especially for applications involving dynamic changing graph records. While labeled graphs are limited, the copious amounts of unlabeled graphs are often easy to obtain with trivial efforts. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a stream based graph classification model by combining both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Our method, called gSLU, employs an ensemble based framework to partition graph streams into a number of graph chunks each containing some labeled and unlabeled graphs. For each individual chunk, we propose a minimum-redundancy subgraph feature selection module to select a set of informative subgraph features to build a classifier. To tackle the concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the subgraph feature selection can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification. Experiments on real-world graph streams demonstrate clear benefits of using minimum-redundancy subgraph features to build accurate classifiers. By employing instance level weighting, our graph ensemble model can effectively adapt to the concept drifting in the graph stream for classification.},

As such, a large proportion of the information it contains is not particularly relevant to many users and in fact is perceived as unwanted 'noise' by many. There has been increased research interest in predicting whether tweets are relevant, newsworthy or credible, using a variety of models and methods. In this paper, we focus on an analysis that highlights the utility of the individual features in Twitter such as hash tags, retweets and mentions for predicting credibility. We first describe a context-based evaluation of the utility of a set of features for predicting manually provided credibility assessments on a corpus of microblog tweets. This is followed by an evaluation of the distribution/presence of each feature across 8 diverse crawls of tweet data. Last, an analysis of feature distribution across dyadic pairs of tweets and retweet chains of various lengths is described. Our results show that the best indicators of credibility include URLs, mentions, retweets and tweet length and that features occur more prominently in data describing emergency and unrest situations.},

Tags have proven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching, mining and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users, and as a result, most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources, while most of the resources receive few tags. Crucially, this incomplete tagging on resources can severely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag, an incentive-based tagging system, which aims at improving tagging quality of resources, by incentivizing taggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In our demonstration, we will show how our system allows users to use simple but powerful strategies to significantly improve the tagging quality of resources.},

This approach uses currently available and free tools in this new application. Co-occurrence networks are a method for visualizing relationships between concepts within written material. The results of a co-occurrence analysis are a network that reflects the relationships between words based on meaning similarities among words and text segments. To illustrate this approach, I applied the methodology of a systematic literature review search that resulted in 391 unique journal articles, books, and reports on identity published in the period from 1995 to 2015. The abstracts, titles, and keywords of these journals were analyzed via linguistic analysis to create a word co-occurrence network of these articles related to identity in science and engineering. Clusters within this network were identified based on word frequency. The results of this research illustrate a hole in the current identity literature in understanding diversity beyond traditional definitions of race, class, and gender. This method has the potential to powerfully convey and embed information about large amounts of data in a single image and offers a new way to report findings from a systematic literature review.},

One way to improve search in bookmarking systems is by adding more metadata to the user-defined tags to enhance tag quality. Such an approach would add value by incorporating information about the content of the resource while retaining the original user-defined tag. Tags automatically extracted from the resource could be the main source for tag enhancement. This paper describes how users' tags can be enhanced with metadata in the form of additional tags automatically extracted from the original document.

Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics.

  abstract = {Social tagging systems (STSs) allow users to annotate information items (songs, pictures, etc.) to provide them item/tag or even user recommendations. STSs consist of three main types of entities: 1) users; 2) items; and 3) tags. These data usually are represented by a three-order tensor, on which Tucker decomposition (TD) models are performed, such as higher order singular value decomposition. However, TD models require cubic computations for the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, TD models suffer from sparsity that incurs in social tagging data. Thus, TD models have limited applicability to large-scale datasets, due to their computational complexity and data sparsity. In this paper, we use two different ways to compute similarity/distance between tags (i.e., the term frequency - inverse document frequency vector space model and the semantic similarity of tags using the ontology of WordNet). Moreover, to reduce the size of the tensor's dimensions and its data sparsity, we use clustering methods (i.e., k-means, spectral clustering, etc.) for discovering tag clusters, which are the intermediaries between a user's profile and items. Thus, instead of inserting the tag dimension in the tensor, we insert the tag cluster dimension, which is smaller and has less noise, resulting to better item recommendation accuracy. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithm with two real datasets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Collaborative filtering recommendation technique is one the most successful and popular approaches. However, collaborative filtering approach only considers whether or not a user likes a specific resource but does not take into account the reason why she/he likes it. Social tagging systems, a well-known mechanism in various Web 2.0 applications, play a crucial role to deal with this issue. In response, some prior studies have tried to incorporate social tagging systems into traditional recommendation approaches to enhance their performance. In this study, we investigate the effect of tag completeness in tag-based recommendation approach by proposing a tag-expansion-based personalized recommendation (TE-PR) technique to enrich user profiles and resource profiles. According to our empirical evaluation results using CiteULike data set, the tag-expansion-based approach indeed improves the performance of recommendation techniques. Moreover, the expanded resource profiles have significant positive contributions on recommendation performance.},

As an initial attempt to answer the two questions, we conduct an experimental study using a video search engine which is capable of learning concept detectors from social media, be it socially tagged videos or socially tagged images. Within the video search engine we investigate six strategies of positive examples selection. The performance is evaluated on the challenging TRECVID benchmark 2011 with 400 hours of Internet videos. The new experiments lead to novel and nontrivial findings: (1) tagged images are a better source for learning video concepts from the web, (2) selecting tag relevant examples as positives for learning video concepts is always beneficial and it can be done automatically and (3) the best source and strategy compare favorably against several present-day methods.},

To make code tagging more fun, we introduce a social gasification approach: developers independently tag code fragments and are rewarded if their solutions conform to the solution of other developers. We implemented the game as a Facebook plug-in. A pilot user study suggests that the game mechanics are motivating and promote the proposition of reasonable tags.},

Despite with many advanced functions, online social interactions can hardly provide online social users with real-world (i.e., offline) social interactions. In this paper, we present an offline friend recommendation system for the OSNS users to have more serendipitous offline interactions. For that, we modeled both offline information (i.e., place visit history) and online social data (i.e., friend relationships) for recommending their offline interactions. Our system discovers those who seems most likely to have potential friend relationship so as to meet in the physical world. We present the design and implementation of our proposed system and conduct real-world experiment to show how the place visit information and online friend relationship together produce a new offline social networking service.},

Existing intelligent argumentation systems allow multiple stakeholders from distributed geographical locations to share their opinions and contribute to a decision making process. In the current system, a stakeholder needs to read all the existing arguments posted by other stakeholders before contributing his/her own ideas/arguments. However, when information accumulates and an argumentation network becomes considerably large, it will cost tremendous time and effort for the stakeholder to read and comprehend all existing arguments. In this paper, we propose methods to implement a recommendation component built into an intelligent argumentation system. The recommendation component can automatically assist a stakeholder to better understand the current state of an argumentation by summarizing and identifying a subset of existing arguments that are relevant to the stakeholder. Thus, our proposed work will allow a stakeholder to efficiently and effectively express his/her thoughts in an intelligent argumentation system in relevant argumentation thread. We also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation component, and the empirical results indicate it is effective according to a real dataset.},

Tag-based image search is an important method to find images contributed by social users in such social websites. However, how to make the top ranked result relevant and, with diversity, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a social re-ranking system for tag-based image retrieval with the consideration of an image's relevance and diversity. We aim at re-ranking images according to their visual information, semantic information, and social clues. The initial results include images contributed by different social users. Usually each user contributes several images. First, we sort these images by inter-user re-ranking. Users that have higher contribution to the given query rank higher. Then we sequentially implement intra-user re-ranking on the ranked user's image set, and only the most relevant image from each user's image set is selected. These selected images compose the final retrieved results. We build an inverted index structure for the social image dataset to accelerate the searching process. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset show that our social re-ranking method is effective and efficient.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral anomaly detection (AD) is an important problem in remote sensing field. It can make full use of the spectral differences to discover certain potential interesting regions without any target priors. Traditional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detectors assume the background spectrum distribution conforms to a Gaussian distribution. However, this and other similar distributions may not be satisfied for the real hyperspectral images. Moreover, the background statistics are susceptible to contamination of anomaly targets which will lead to a high false-positive rate. To address these intrinsic problems, this paper proposes a novel AD method based on the graph theory. We first construct a vertex- and edge-weighted graph and then utilize a pixel selection process to locate the anomaly targets. Two contributions are claimed in this paper: 1) no background distributions are required which makes the method more adaptive and 2) both the vertex and edge weights are considered which enables a more accurate detection performance and better robustness to noise. Intensive experiments on the simulated and real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other benchmark competitors. In addition, the robustness of the proposed method has been validated by using various window sizes. This experimental result also demonstrates the valuable characteristic of less computational complexity and less parameter tuning for real applications.},

  abstract = {Many images uploaded to social networks are related to travel, since people consider traveling to be an important event in their life. However, a significant amount of travel images on the Internet lack proper geographical annotations or tags. In many cases, the images are tagged manually. One way to make this time-consuming manual tagging process more efficient is to propagate tags from a small set of tagged images to the larger set of untagged images automatically. In this paper, we present a system for automatic geotag propagation in images based on the similarity between image content (famous landmarks) and its context (associated geotags). In such a scenario, however, an incorrect or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated propagation system. Therefore, for reliable geotags propagation, we suggest adopting a user trust model based on social feedback from the users of the photo-sharing system. We compare this socially-driven approach with other user trust models via experiments and subjective testing on an image database of various famous landmarks. Results demonstrate that relying on user feedback is more efficient, since the number of propagated tags more than doubles without loss of accuracy compared to using other models or propagating without trust modeling.},

In this trend, the need for effective Information Retrieval (IR) technique has been increased. Although document data contain much more abundant information, users can retrieve necessary information only from the title and description in conventional web services. In order to meet the demands for fast and accurate retrieval of valuable information, we propose a fast and effective content-based document information retrieval system that retrieves the information from the actual content of a document. The proposed method is based on a topic model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is used to extract major keywords for a given document. The main contributions of our system are the increased flexibility, effectiveness, and fast retrieval of information. Our system can easily communicate with existing web service through the standard JSON format. In addition, we increase the speed of information retrieval by using NoSQL based database system with inverted indexing and B-tree based indexing. We validate the performance of our system on real data collected from the SlideShare service. The proposed system shows better retrieval performance over the existing IR system.},

  abstract = {Social image analysis and retrieval is important for helping people organize and access the increasing amount of user tagged multimedia. Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

The so-called “digital natives” acquire, as a consequence of their early exposure to these technologies, different patterns of work, distinct attention conducts, new learning preferences and, generally, better skills for learning and working within rich online social contexts. So, it seems reasonable that the traditional education systems evolve, and shape their practice to leverage those new patterns. Though online social networks (OSNs) stand as a powerful tool to extend existing online learning management systems (LMSs) by using them as a gateway to OSNs, LMSs do not exploit fully the advantages of an active social environment for reinforcing the learning experience. We report in this paper the design, development and use of a software platform which enlarges and adapts the basic features of an OSN in order to be useful for very general learning environments. The software allows the creation, assessment and reporting of a range of collaborative activities based on social interactions among the students, and offers a reward mechanism by means of ranking and reputation. We argue that this approach is helpful in increasing the students' motivation, besides improving the learning experience and performance. The software has been tested in an undergraduate course about computer networks. Different tests confirm that the impact on learning success is statistically significant and positive.},

Most of the existing annotation methods rely on content-based approach to annotation, whose effectiveness is restricted due to the semantic gap between low-level features and semantic annotations, as well as the irrelevance between annotations and image content. Recently, social media analysis has been investigated for image annotation. Inspired by the abundant social diffusion records of images in online social networks, we propose a novel image annotation approach based on social diffusion analysis. We present a common-interest model to interpret social diffusion, i.e. different images have different social diffusion routes due to the preferences of users, and such preferences are represented as common interests of pairwise users rather than personalized interests. We propose an image annotation framework that consists of learning of common interests, feature extraction from social diffusion records, and automatic annotation by learning to rank. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms content-based and user-preference-based annotation methods.},

We conduct the first study that surveys the literature related to social authentication. In this paper, we not only created a taxonomy for classifying all social authentication schemes deployed in online or physical social contexts and extensively analyzed their authentication features, but also built a novel framework for evaluating the effectiveness of all social authentication schemes, identified all the practical and theoretical attacks that may be mounted against such schemes, addressed possible defense strategies, and identified challenges, open questions, and future research opportunities. To measure their accuracy, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, as well as to identify the potential of knowledge-based and trust-based social authentication schemes, a comprehensive comparative assessment of the security, usability, and deployability was conducted. We hope, by providing a solid foundation for gaining sufficient understanding of the manners in which users' social interactions have been utilized in user authentication schemes and their corresponding security implications, we will guide future research in this domain.},

Initially researches in RS mainly focused to improve only accuracy of the system, however improving only accuracy does not improve user satisfaction. Recently, it has been identified that diversity is an important dimension for evaluating a recommendation system. Users find a diversified set of recommendations more interesting than a monotonous only relevance based recommendations. This paper focuses only on the diversification techniques introduced in recommendation systems. We studied papers and articles published in academic literature and categorized them into different categories. We have also highlighted trending directions that are being used to diversify recommendations.},

Recommender Systems (RS) improves users' shopping experience by by recommending them a shopping item. Many techniques have been introduced to enhance RS algorithms, including social tagging. Social Tagging let users share resources and this lead to more personalized recommendation. There is a lack of overall information about RS algorithms that have implemented social tagging. Therefore, in this paper we compared and analysed some of the studies that have particularly used social tagging in recommender systems. Both Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-based filtering systems were compared, and results show that it is better to combine these algorithms for achieving higher personalized recommendation, and also to address the cold start issue.},

  abstract  = {With the increasing number of Web services available on the Internet, how to recommend Web services to interested users effectively and efficiently remains to be a big challenge. At present, collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used technique in the design of recommender systems to handle information overload. For Web services, however, it is difficult for user to collect personalized QoS (Quality of Service)data and other explicit feedbacks such as ratings. In most cases, only a part of the implicit feedbacks (e.g., watchlist) is available in service registry. In this paper, we leverage implicit feedback from user's watchlist to build a CF-based recommender system for Web service. Our main contribution is to transform implicit feedbacks into explicit ratings to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. More specifically, we first construct binary user-service rating matrix according to the implicit feedback from the watchlist. Then, temporal and tag preference are combined into the original rating matrix to generate a more accurate pseudo rating matrix, which can reflect users' different preference on services in their own watchlists. Finally, we use traditional user-based CF method to produce a personalized service recommendation list with corresponding pseudo ratings. Moreover, the empirical experiments based on ProgrammableWeb show that compared with traditional log-based CF method, the recommender system with temporal and tag preference is more accurate and precise.},

Most existing approaches are performed by training independent concept detectors omitting the interdependencies between concepts. The obtained annotations are often not so satisfactory. Therefore, a process of annotation refinement is mondatory to improve the imprecise annotation results. Recently, harnessing the contextual correlation between concepts is shown to be an important resource to improve concept detection. In this paper, we propose a new context based concept detection process. For this purpose, we define a new semantic measure called Second order Co-occurence Flickr context similarity (SOCFCS), which aggregates the FCS values of common Flickr related-tags of two target concepts in order to calculate their relative semantic context relatedness (SCR). Our proposed measure is applied to build a concept network as the context space. A Random Walk with Restart process is performed over this network to refine the annotation results by exploring the contextual correlation among concepts. Experimental studies are conducted on ImageCLEF 2011 Collection containing 99 concepts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {High-Order Co-Clustering (HOCC) methods have attracted high attention in recent years because of their ability to cluster multiple types of objects simultaneously using all available information. During the clustering process, HOCC methods exploit object co-occurrence information, i.e., inter-type relationships amongst different types of objects as well as object affinity information, i.e., intra-type relationships amongst the same types of objects. However, it is difficult to learn accurate intra-type relationships in the presence of noise and outliers. Existing HOCC methods consider the p nearest neighbours based on Euclidean distance for the intra-type relationships, which leads to incomplete and inaccurate intra-type relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel HOCC method that incorporates multiple subspace learning with a heterogeneous manifold ensemble to learn complete and accurate intra-type relationships. Multiple subspace learning reconstructs the similarity between any pair of objects that belong to the same subspace. The heterogeneous manifold ensemble is created based on two-types of intra-type relationships learnt using p-nearest-neighbour graph and multiple subspaces learning. Moreover, in order to make sure the robustness of clustering process, we introduce a sparse error matrix into matrix decomposition and develop a novel iterative algorithm. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method achieves improved results over the state-of-art HOCC methods for FScore and NMI.},

The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application. However, existing surveys are either outdated or they focus only on a few methods. As a result, there is an increasing need to summarize the obtained knowledge in a concise, yet informative manner. Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as this task poses significant challenges due to varying conditions during data acquisition. In addition, face verification is a natural application for distance metric learning because the encountered challenge is to define a distance function that: 1) accurately expresses the notion of similarity for verification; 2) is robust to noisy data; 3) generalizes well to unseen subjects; and 4) scales well with the dimensionality and number of training samples. In particular, we utilize well-tested features to assess the performance of selected methods following the experimental protocol of the state-of-the-art database labeled faces in the wild. A summary of the results is presented along with a discussion of the insights obtained and lessons learned by employing the corresponding algorithms.},

Cast differently, classification of user-generated content into generalized categories is the equivalent of automated programs trying to match human adjudged labels. It seems logical to suspect that identification and incorporation of features generally found salient by humans or “focal points”, can allow an automated agent to better match human adjudged labels in classification tasks. In this paper, we leverage this correspondence, by using domain-specific focal points to further inform the classification algorithms of the inherent human biases. We empirically evaluate our method, by classifying YouTube videos using user-annotated tags. Improvements in classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art classification techniques on using our transformed (using focal points) and highly reduced feature space reveals the value of the approach in subjective classification tasks.},

Discovering the correlations among different tags can significantly help predicting precise labels for videos and images. Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty. By casting the video concept detection and image annotation tasks into a sparse multi-label transfer learning framework in this paper, ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, and the multi-label extended sparse discriminant analysis methods are, respectively, well explored and compared.},

LMSs (Learning Management Systems) include such collaborative tools to enable knowledge sharing. Common topology and design constructs of online collaboration are often expressed as forum threads; however, forums or bulletin boards are not primarily designed for social constructivist learning, in which knowledge develops collaboratively in a methodical process that links new items to existing ones. In this paper, we present a preliminary concept and hypothesize that social constructivist learning can be implemented through a semantic network topology of a discussion platform. To that end, we developed Ligilo, a peer-learning, online platform, in which each content item is conveyed as a node in a semantic network constructed of posts. Analysis of this platform consists of three parts. First, we review the theoretical background of networked-structured discussions in learning. Then, we describe the architecture of Ligilo, focusing on two aspects: (1) the learning experience as a process of contributing new information items by relating to existing items and (2) a deep, behavioral analytics framework as a teacher's guide. Both these aspects are based on semantic network topology. We conclude the paper by describing some early cases of peer learning involving networked-structured discussions.},

It is possible to construct semantic relationships among tags. To do this, one way of building of relationships among tags is use of a popularized tag as a thing of ontology. However, it is not easy to select the popularized tag from tag cloud and to build a complete ontology with all of tags in the tag-cloud because tags are timely and dynamically updated added with tremendous numbers of tags. Therefore, we construct Primitive Ontologies (POs). A general tag is used to as a thing of a PO. The general tag is matched into one of requested keywords by users. In addition, we propose a methodology to evolve ontology using tags. To construct and evolve a PO, it defines classes and relationships between given tags by a user. Finally, the constructed several POs are integrated into a Tag-Based integrated Semantic ontology (TBiSont) by building relationships between classes that are included in each different PO. The construction of relationships among tags depends on linked resources into tags. The properties of tags are usually characterized by linked resources. It causes to extract semantic relationships among tags, because tags are comprised of meta-information that represents properties of resources. Thereby, the proposed PO is constructed by a general tag as a best-referring tag and relationships among tags including the general tag. The TBiSont as an integration of POs was applied into data analysis and a search process to verify efficiency of as in application systems. When we applied TBiSont into searching, it shows that TBiSont is more efficient than the other statistical-based search systems to increase accuracy or diversity of search results.},

The rich cross-media information carried by the multimodal data in multiple media has a wide audience, deeply reflects the social realities, and brings about much greater social impact than any single media information. Therefore, automatically detecting topics from cross media is of great benefit for the organizations (i.e., advertising agencies and governments) that care about the social opinions. However, cross-media topic detection is challenging from the following aspects: 1) the multimodal data from different media often involve distinct characteristics and 2) topics are presented in an arbitrary manner among the noisy web data. In this paper, we propose a multimodality fusion framework and a topic recovery (TR) approach to effectively detect topics from cross-media data. The multimodality fusion framework flexibly incorporates the heterogeneous multimodal data into a multimodality graph, which takes full advantage from the rich cross-media information to effectively detect topic candidates (T.C.). The TR approach solidly improves the entirety and purity of detected topics by: 1) merging the T.C. that are highly relevant themes of the same real topic and 2) filtering out the less-relevant noise data in the merged T.C. Extensive experiments on both single-media and cross-media data sets demonstrate the promising flexibility and effectiveness of our method in detecting topics from cross media.},

Based on an expert's digital trace, the system is able to request their support in providing answers to problems others have posted. Siemens' TechnoWeb is used as case study to demonstrate such a system. Knowledge is an indispensable asset of corporations, and increasing the productivity of the knowledge worker is an important management challenge in the 21st century. As such, knowledge management systems (KMS) play a crucial role. Siemens has combined a corporate social media platform, knowledge networking and formerly isolated bodies of knowledge with a semantic algorithm that can identify relevant experts. The system allows for innovation to occur and problems to be solved by experts, who would previously not have been involved.},

Existing approaches which deals with such recommendation system apply collaborative filtering techniques to specify the most alike users whom they hope to make recommendations. Collaborative Filtering will significantly show better improvement with the enclosure of real data extraction from the suitable tagging system. In this paper, data from social tagging systems are extracted for every individual considering the correlations between users, items, and tag information. Tag information from users is the most decisive factor to predict the personalized suggestion for web users. Here, we rank the available content based tag information with the inclusion of temporal decay of users' behavior over time and the centrality of every node in the network. Finally, we use the common preference metric for effective personalization. Results have been experimentally demonstrated with the empirical dataset MovieLens and provided the results as an alternative recommendation method with simplicity and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Tag recommendation is an integral part of any bookmarking application. With the growing popularity in Web 2.0 usage, recommending tags is of utmost importance in enabling a user to perform bookmarking easily. An issue that most recommendation systems do not consider is that users have a tendency to choose from tags that are suggested to them, which might bias the true popular rankings of tags. In this paper we consider the problem of tag recommendation for bookmarks based on user feedback. We propose an approach for automatic tag recommendation by using a suggestion set and discuss a randomized suggestion rule for learning the true popular tags. As our algorithm depends on the frequency of tag suggestions, the action of spammers and malicious users may result in skewed ranking of tags for a bookmark. Hence, there arises a need to identify malicious users and spam posts to reinforce the efficiency of our algorithm because spammers can easily mislead a system. We have proposed an approach for classifying spammers based on tagging history of users. Our approach basically estimates the probability of a user being a spammer by analyzing previous posts and tags. Our analysis on a dataset of a popular bookmarking site shows that the proposed method is effective in suggesting the true popular tags and identifying spammers.},

One way to address this challenge is to consider these data streams as containing a set of high-level topics. In this research we address the problem of: given a collection of tweets about K high-level topics, how to find topic words that describe these topics as well as how to label each tweet with one of the K topics using a topic modeling approach. Current research has shown that applying topic modeling algorithms directly on tweets does not lead to good results. Hence one approach is to group related tweets together, so as to form a single “pseudo-document”, which is more informative than a single tweet. In this paper we evaluate different grouping schemes found in the literature and propose a new grouping scheme utilizing named entities and word collocations. Results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the existing approaches, to a some extent for all the test cases, and for both finding high-level topics and tweet labeling.},

However, as the social network services always contain large amounts of information on different topics, and people have different influence on different topic, so the group recommendation systems should take the topic identification in large-scale social networks into account to get an appropriate recommendation. In this paper, we proposed a new group recommendation method, which combines topic identification and social networks for group recommendation. In detail, we firstly identify different topical sub-groups by topics in social networks. Secondly, different user factors are used to calculate the user influence (including individual and social) on the topical sub-groups, which can depict the topical sub-group characteristics in different points of view. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the prediction accuracy of the group recommendation.},

However, such support -- and therefore IDEs as awhole -- operate on one revision of the code at a time, and leave handling of code history to external tools or plugins, such asEGit for Eclipse. For example, when a method is removed froma class, developers can no longer find the method through code completion. This forces developers to manually switch across different revisions or resort to using external tools when they need to learn about previous code revisions.We propose a novel approach of adding a temporal dimensionto IDEs, enabling code completion and navigation to operate on multiple revisions of code at a time. We previously introduced the idea of temporal code completion and navigation,and presented a vision for how that idea may be realized.This paper realizes that vision by implementing and evaluatinga prototype tool called Tempura. We describe our algorithmfor processing and indexing historical code information from repositories for Tempura, and demonstrate Tempura's scalability with three large Eclipse projects. We also evaluate Tempura's usability through a controlled user study. The study participantslearned about the code history with more accuracy when usingTempura compared to EGit. Although the sample size was notlarge enough to provide strong statistical significance, the resultsshow a promising outlook for our approach.},

Global labels, i.e., atomic information describing a music title in its entirety, such as its genre, mood, main instruments, or type of vocals, are entered by humans. Classifiers are trained to map audio features to these labels. However, the performances of these classifiers on individual labels are rarely satisfactory. In the case we have to predict several labels simultaneously, we introduce a correction scheme to improve these performances. In this scheme-an instance of the classifier fusion paradigm-an extra layer of classifiers is built to exploit redundancies between labels and correct some of the errors coming from the individual acoustic classifiers. We describe a series of experiments aiming at validating this approach on a large-scale database of music and metadata (about 30 000 titles and 600 labels per title). The experiments show that the approach brings statistically significant improvements.},

The main idea behind tagging is to allow users to provide metadata to the web content from their perspective to facilitate categorization and retrieval. There are many factors that influence users' tag choice. Many studies have been conducted to reveal these factors by analysing tagging data. This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging.},

In this paper, we attempt to exploit a new interaction data, namely print logs, where each record is printing URLs selected by a user using a popular web printing tool. Users usually print web contents based on an intention (subtask or task). Apparently, mining common print tasks from print logs is able to capture users' intentions, which undoubtedly benefits many web applications, such as task oriented recommendation and behavior targeting. However, it is not an easy job to perform this due to the difficulty of URL topic representation and task formulation. To this end, we propose a general framework, named UPT (Users Print Tasks mining framework), for mining print tasks from print logs. Specifically, we attempt to leverage delicious (a social book marking web service) as an external thesaurus to expand the expression of each URL by selecting tags associated with the domain of each URL. Then, we construct a tag co-occurrence graph where similar tags can be clustered as subtasks. If we view each subtask as an item, then the print log is transformed to a transaction database, on which an efficient pattern mining algorithm is proposed to induce tasks. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments on a real print log.},

The relevance estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In this method, a social image hypergraph is constructed, where vertices represent images and hyperedges represent visual or textual terms. Learning is achieved with use of a set of pseudo-positive images, where the weights of hyperedges are updated throughout the learning process. In this way, the impact of different tags and visual words can be automatically modulated. Comparative results of the experiments conducted on a dataset including 370+images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {On a crowdsourcing platform consisting of requestersand workers, it is a challenge to recommend suitableworkers for a human intelligence task (HIT) published by a requester. A suitable worker is the one who has a high probability of submitting a correct answer for the published HIT. However, there are four problems that make the existing methods be less effective in recommending suitable workers. First, on most of crowdsourcing platforms, the great majority of workers have good reputations and thus are regarded as homogenous workers who have equal opportunities to be recommended. Secondly, dishonest workers may gain recommendations by counterfeiting good reputations and overstating personal skills. Moreover, the classical data sparsity and cold start problems co-exist in crowdsourcing environments. To effectively differentiate homogenous workers, we firstlycalculate a worker's performance in different types of HITspublished by different requesters. Aiming to improve the accuracy of predicting a worker's performance, we propose a metric which separately considers two requesters' similarities in transacting with the common workers they trust and in transacting with the common workers they distrust. Afterwards, targeting dishonest behaviours, we propose a transaction-based trust model. Targeting the data sparsity problem, we propose a new trust sub-network extraction algorithm (TSE) to discover more requesters who can provide trustworthy opinions for generating recommendations. Furthermore, we propose two strategiesfor solving the cold start problem. Finally, by incorporatingthe similarity metric, the new trust model, the new trustsub-network extraction algorithm and the new strategies, wepropose a novel trust-aware worker recommendation methodCrowdRec. The experimental results illustrate that CrowdRecsignificantly outperforms CF and three state-of-the-art trustbased recommendation methods both in terms of accuracy and coverage.},

Because news media sources play a key role in the formation of public opinion, their coverage also plays a major role in the dynamics of the public debates. It can be hypothesized that the public interactions of political players may be treated differently in the media based on the editorial perspective of the media sources in question and the positions that the political players occupy in the political arena. However, the question arises, how can these differences be measured? Using corpus extraction techniques, SPARQL queries, and ontology engineering, this study compares the positions that key political players occupy in discourse spaces that are modeled by two ideologically distant news media sources based on the same controversial public issue.},

For massive graphs, subgraph queries may have enormous number of matches, and so it is inefficient to compute all matches when only top-k matches are desired. Meanwhile, parallel algorithm is urgent for the scalability of massive graph computing. In this paper, we address the challenges of top-k subgraph query in massive graph. Firstly, we present a new graph matching notion: “approximate graph simulation”. With approximate graph simulation, top-k subgraph query can be customized by appointing a weighted query graph, which provides good flexibility for different application scenarios. Secondly, we propose a parallel top-k subgraph query algorithm at the level of vertex. With such algorithm, each vertex in massive graph obtains its matching state separately without requiring global graph information. In the algorithm, we also design a filter mechanism to speed up the the computation and a aggregation mechanism to obtain top-k vertices for query focus. Using real-life datasets, we experimentally verify that our approach of parallel top-k subgraph query are efficient.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of social image understanding, i.e., tag refinement, tag assignment, and image retrieval. Different from previous work, we propose a novel weakly supervised deep matrix factorization algorithm, which uncovers the latent image representations and tag representations embedded in the latent subspace by collaboratively exploring the weakly supervised tagging information, the visual structure, and the semantic structure. Due to the well-known semantic gap, the hidden representations of images are learned by a hierarchical model, which are progressively transformed from the visual feature space. It can naturally embed new images into the subspace using the learned deep architecture. The semantic and visual structures are jointly incorporated to learn a semantic subspace without overfitting the noisy, incomplete, or subjective tags. Besides, to remove the noisy or redundant visual features, a sparse model is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep architecture. Finally, a unified optimization problem with a well-defined objective function is developed to formulate the proposed problem and solved by a gradient descent procedure with curvilinear search. Extensive experiments on real-world social image databases are conducted on the tasks of image understanding: image tag refinement, assignment, and retrieval. Encouraging results are achieved with comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed solution allows users to construct a sequence of video items by imposing global and transitional constraints. Transitional constraints deal with the similarity between successive video objects while global constraints ensure that the retrieved video attributes attain the proposed user profile. The retrieved sequence of videos is constructed by considering it as a solution to a constrained sequence retrieval problem where constraints represent user preferences. The constrained retrieval problem is then modeled as a network flow model which leads to integer program. Relaxation techniques are then used for complexity reduction. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model in constructing the playlist according to user needs.},

The location of the user is an important information item that can be associated to the existing user profile in order to provide efficient recommendations. Also, easy availability of GPS enabled devices brings a large amount of GPS trajectories representing user's mobile logs. These GPS trajectories can be used to mine interesting patterns about users.

  abstract  = {The information available in the World Wide Web is stored using many real Web databases (e.g. vehicle database). Accessing the information from these real Web databases has become increasingly important for the users to find the desired information. Web users search for the desired information by querying these Web databases, when the number of query results generated is large, it is very difficult for the Web user to select the most relevant information from the large result set generated. Users today, have become more and more demanding in terms of the quality of information that is provided to them while searching the Web databases. The most common solution to solve the problem involves ranking the query results returned by the Web databases. Earlier approaches have used query logs, user profiles and frequencies of database values. The problem in all of these techniques is that ranking is performed in a user and query independent manner. This paper, proposes an automated ranking of query results returned by Web databases by analyzing user, query and workload similarity. The effectiveness of this approach is discussed considering a vehicle Web database as an example.},

It is essential to conduct a comprehensive survey on the related work, which would benefit the research community by providing better understanding of the state-of-the-art and insights into the future research directions. The paper first defines the spectrum of Knowledge Organization Systems, from unstructured with less semantics to highly structured with richer semantics. It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories. We summarize the prominent issues with the current research and highlight future directions on learning constantly evolving knowledge from social media data.},

  abstract  = {With the development of social media technology, users often register accounts, post messages and create friend links on several different platforms. Performing user identity mapping on multi-platform based on the behavior patterns of users is considerable for network supervision and personalization service. The existing methods focus on utilizing either text information or structure information alone. However, text information and structure information reflect different aspects of a user. An organic combination of them is beneficial to mining user behavior patterns, thus help identify users across platforms accurately. The challenging problems are the effective representation and similarity computation of the text and structure information. We propose a mapping method which integrates text and structure information. At first, the model represents user name, description, location information based on word2vec or string matching, and friend information represented as relation network is regarded as structure information. Then these information are used for similarity computation using Jaccard index or cosine similarity. After similarity computation, a linear model is adopted to get the overall similarity of user pairs to perform user mapping. Based on the proposed method, we develop a prototype system, which allows users to set and adjust the weights of different information, or set expected index. The experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model.},

In that model, a partially annotated collection with a lot of non-labeled music was annotated at a high precision and recall. In this paper, we proposed a new model -- label probability prediction model -- and introduce it into the Sordo's work, which makes a combined model, to improve the accuracy of propagation without exploiting any other information. In addition, we also made some modifications to the original Sordo's model that could make the algorithm works better. Then we compare the result of combined model to that yielded by the original on a publicly accessible ground truth data, and find that, the new approach can reach a higher recall. Furthermore, with the same recall, our method obtains a better precision.},

Rooting from the machine learning, recommender systems are in the center of the knowledge engineering that are used frequently in many computer science related fields. Therefore, this paper tries to utilize time information inferred from users' ages, which is going to be employed in the recommender systems during the similarity calculation between users. Adding more parameters, in other words, inserting detailed information of the users' preferences into the calculations will stimulate the resolution of fulfilling results thanks to new criterion. Specifically, it is proposed a conversion between two particular dates which are relevant to the user's personal data. 10-year interval is considered as a transition between generations, thus generation gap between users can make sense positively or negatively in terms of the amount of gap. Additionally, for the prerequisite of being a peer, it is defined a 3-year long difference can be a boundary to say that two users can be in the same wavelength. From the inspiration of this idea, a new mathematical addition into the well-known similarity calculation is presented in this paper. Eventually, this further time detail is taken into account via inverse proportion in similarity calculation and time incorporation approach for recommender system is emphasized. All in all, proposed method is to be tested with a real valued Movie Lens-MLP dataset on the platform of MatLab.},

The idea of the proposed approach has its basis in three assumptions: 1) exemplars should come from high-density samples; 2) exemplars should be either the components of the reduced set or their neighbors with high similarities; and 3) clusters can be diffused by surrounding both exemplars and its labeled reduced set. We theoretically analyze the proposed FEF from the perspective of the generalization performance of clustering and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on several benchmarking datasets.},

Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we introduce algorithms for pruning and aging user ratings in collaborative filtering systems, based on their oldness, under the rationale that aged user ratings may not accurately reflect the current state of users regarding their preferences. The aging algorithm reduces the importance of aged ratings, while the pruning algorithm removes them from the database. The algorithms are evaluated against various types of datasets. The pruning algorithm has been found to present a number of advantages, namely (1) reducing the rating database size, (2) achieving better prediction generation times and (3) improving prediction quality by cutting off predictions with high error. The algorithm can be used in all rating databases that include a timestamp and has been proved to be effective in any type of dataset, from movies and music, to videogames and books.},

  abstract = {A novel method to obtain hierarchical and overlapping clusters from network data – i.e., a set of nodes endowed with pairwise dissimilarities – is presented. The introduced method is hierarchical in the sense that it outputs a nested collection of groupings of the node set depending on the resolution or degree of similarity desired, and it is overlapping since it allows nodes to belong to more than one group. Our construction is rooted on the facts that a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering of a network can be equivalently represented by a finite ultrametric space and that a convex combination of ultrametrics results in a cut metric. By applying a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering method to multiple dithered versions of a given network and then convexly combining the resulting ultrametrics, we obtain a cut metric associated to the network of interest. We then show how to extract a hierarchical overlapping clustering structure from the aforementioned cut metric. Furthermore, the so-called overlapping function is presented as a tool for gaining insights about the data by identifying meaningful resolutions of the obtained hierarchical structure. Additionally, we explore hierarchical overlapping quasi-clustering methods that preserve the asymmetry of the data contained in directed networks. Finally, the presented method is illustrated via synthetic and real-world classification problems including handwritten digit classification and authorship attribution of famous plays.},

Recently, it has been shown that if each data class is linearly spanned by a subspace of unknown dimensions and the data are noiseless, the lowest-rank representation (LRR) of a set of test vector samples with respect to a set of training vector samples has the nature of being both dense for within-class affinities and almost zero for between-class affinities. Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the LRRC among the classifiers that is compared to.},

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},

Good representations are an important requirement for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks to be performed successfully. However, a major problem with neural networks is that training time becomes prohibitive for very large datasets and the learning algorithm can get stuck in local minima for very deep and wide network architectures. In this paper we examine 3 ways to improve feature learning for audio data using neural networks: 1.using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) instead of standard sigmoid units; 2.using a powerful regularisation technique called Dropout; 3.using Hessian-Free (HF) optimisation to improve training of sigmoid nets. We show that these methods provide significant improvements in training time and the features learnt are better than state of the art handcrafted features, with a genre classification accuracy of 83 ± 1.1% on the Tzanetakis (GTZAN) dataset. We found that the rectifier networks learnt better features than the sigmoid networks. We also demonstrate the capacity of the features to capture relevant information from audio data by applying them to genre classification on the ISMIR 2004 dataset.},

Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

The common practice is to have each platform captures and maintains data related to its own users. Later the data is analyzed to produce user specific recommendations. We argue that recommendations could be enriched by considering data consolidated from multiple sources instead of limiting the analysis to data captured from a single source. Integrating data from multiple sources is analogous to watching the behavior and preferences of each user on multiple platforms instead of a limited one platform based vision. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which utilizes user specific data collected from multiple platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to make recommendations by consulting multiple social networks to produce a rich modeling of user behavior. For this purpose, we collected and anonymized a specific dataset that contains information from BlogCatalog, Twitter and Flickr web-sites. We implemented several different types of recommendation methodologies to observe their performances while using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources. The conducted experiments showed that using multiple features from multiple social networks produces a wider perspective of user behavior and preferences leading to improved recommendation outcome.},

In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

  abstract  = {Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common items which are tagged either manually or in a semiautomatic manner. However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).},

Specifically, our unsupervised framework is capable of seamlessly uncovering latent correlations among heterogeneous types of data sources, despite the non-trivial heteroscedasticity and dimensionality discrepancy problems. Additionally, the proposed model is robust to partial or missing non-visual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two crowded public surveillance datasets.},

Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the best tag sequence for a given observation sequence of words. TnT performs well on known word sequences. But, the performance degrades with increase in the number of unknown words. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome this performance degradation using fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rule based model is designed to provide TnT with sufficient information about the tag of unknown words without degrading the performance of TnT. When TnT with fuzzy rule based learning encounters an unknown word, the TnT generates a set of possible tags for the given word, based on the fuzzy rules matched by the word. If the word does not match any fuzzy rule, then the model depends upon the probability distribution of the suffix. This approach guarantees that the performance of TnT will only be improved from its normal performance.},

Using content and querying value together increases the visibility of documents more efficiently than using them individually. Selection of attributes for annotation is called as “Attribute Suggestion Problem”. Various methods like information extraction and query forms have been used for this purpose, but they are expensive and inaccurate.

  abstract = {An image in social media, termed a social image, exhibits characteristics different from images widely discussed in image processing. They can be described by both content and social related attributes, called social image attributes, including visual contents, users, tags, and timestamps. There are strong coupling relationships between social image attributes, which make social images not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). By analyzing the relationships among these attributes, we can better understand the semantic activities conducted on such non-IID social images, hence enabling new applications including content organization, recommendation, and social activity understanding. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to analyze the coupling relationships between social images, which involves not only intra-coupled similarity within a social image attribute, but also inter-coupled similarity between attributes, in analyzing the non-IIDness of the similarity between social images. In particular, we propose a multi-entry version of the coupled similarity metric to deal with attributes (i.e., tags) which have a many-to-one relationship with respect to images. Experimental results on a Flickr group dataset show that the proposed algorithm captures coupling relationships and therefore achieves promising results in various applications, including image clustering and tagging.},

The potential of very subtle yet important emergent semantics hidden in such environments calls for equally elegant and powerful methods to "mine" them. However, much of the previous work on model based recommender systems for folksonomies considered user to resource and resource to tag similarity separately, ignoring the dependency of users' interest to both the tags and the corresponding resources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic personalized recommendation model, Latent Interest Model, that accounts for users, tags and resources jointly. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on real data sets obtained from a popular online bookmarking site using different performance measures for tag and resource recommendation tasks. Our experimental results show that our model captures personal preferences for tag usage and resource selection.

Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy. The experimental results on a real-world dataset, Citeulike, indicate significant improvements in recommendation quality and better performance compared with the existing systems.},

With the explosive growth of digital music available on the Web, automatic audio tagging, which can be used to annotate unknown music or retrieve desirable music, is becoming increasingly important. This can be achieved by training a binary classifier for each tag based on the labeled music data. Our method that won the MIREX 2009 audio tagging competition is one of this kind of methods. However, since social tags are usually assigned by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation information is useful for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem and propose two solutions to solve it. The experimental results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

In write-through policy, write is done synchronously both to cache and main memory. But, write-through policy causes large energy overhead due to frequent lower lever cache accesses during write operations. A new cache architecture called Tag-Bloom cache is proposed in order to reduce the power consumption. Here, a tag is attached to each way in the L2 cache. This way tag is stored in way-tag array in L1 cache. Utilizing these tags, L2 cache can be accessed as a direct mapping cache during subsequent write hits, thereby power consumption is reduced. A Bloom Filter is introduced to accurately predict the cache miss and hot/cold checks. A considerable energy saving is obtained based on SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks along with a small area overhead and no performance degradation. High-performance microprocessors now-a-days use longer addresses and hence cache tag arrays become longer. This concept of Tag-Bloom can be applied to other existing cache design techniques to achieve further power reduction.},

To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic topic model to formalize the correlation of tags with visual features via the latent semantic topics. Our proposed approach allows us to effectively annotate and refine tags based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm for approximate inference. Moreover, we present a measuring scheme using the refined tags and extracted topics for ranking the images.

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a “query and ranking” manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.},

We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively.

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of social image tagging using practical vocabulary for mobile users on the social media. On the social media, images usually have an incomplete or noisy set of social tags provided by the mobile users, and we consider this issue as defective tag assignments. Previous studies on social image tagging have mostly focused on multi-label classification without considering the defective tags. In these studies, the usage of multi-label classification techniques is expected to synergically exploit the linear relations between the image features and the semantic tags. However, these approaches usually aimed to capture the linear relations from the training data while ignoring the helpful information from the test data. In addition, they failed to incorporate the non-linear associations residing in the visual features as well as in the semantic tags. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel approach based on non-linear matrix completion for image tagging task with defective tags. Specifically, we first construct the entire feature-tag matrix based on the visual features with non-linear kernel mapping. Then, we present a formal methodology together with an optimization method under the matrix completion framework to jointly complete the tags of training and test images. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method shows promising results on image tagging task on two benchmark social image datasets with defective tags, and establishes a baseline for such models in this research domain.},

  abstract  = {Being able to predict whether a song can be a hit has important applications in the music industry. Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes. Our contribution is to demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive method for generating sub-class representations has the ability to improve classification results in the case of tag classes that are visually highly heterogenous. The approach is evaluated on a set of 1 million photos with 10 top-level classes, from the dataset released by the ACM Multimedia 2013 Yahoo!

The features in frame-based feature vector sequence format are further represented by their mean and standard deviation such that they can be combined with other segment-based features to form a fixed-dimensional feature vector for a segment. We train an ensemble classifier, which consists of SVM and AdaBoost classifiers, for each tag. For the audio annotation task, the individual classifier outputs are transformed into calibrated probability scores such that probability ensemble can be employed. For the audio retrieval task, we propose using ranking ensemble.

Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

The second classifier maps actively corrupted tags to the true tags, reducing incorrect mappings caused by low-level acoustic variations in the first classifier, and to augment the tags with additional relevant tags. Training the classifiers is implemented using marginal co-regularization, pair of which draws the two classifiers into agreement by a joint optimization.

However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when facing severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within a specific human action domain. Furthermore, as an extension, we learn a conditional model by incorporation of pose tags to further increase the accuracy of pose correction. In the experiments, significant improvements on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction are observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system. Our experiments for the facial landmark correction also illustrate that our algorithm can improve the accuracy of other detection/estimation systems.},

  abstract  = {The automation of image tagging is extremely important research topic in recent years due to its importance in building large image databases. The optimal goal of recent research is to automatically annotate images and overcome the semantic gap between the image content and the associated text representation. Image retrieval from large databases is one of the important domains that can benefit from automatic tagging. The automatic tagging task is currently associated with many challenges ranging from inaccuracy of retrieval technique to the efficiency and speed of the tagging approaches. In this paper we propose a statistical based tagging approach that uses normalized multidimensional color histograms as a global descriptor of low level features of images. Our results demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform the Learning based methods in terms of accuracy and speed.},

  abstract = {While a listener may derive semantic associations for audio clips from direct auditory cues (e.g., hearing “bass guitar”) as well as from “context” (e.g., inferring “bass guitar” in the context of a “rock” song), most state-of-the-art systems for automatic music annotation ignore this context. Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.},

Automatic image annotation is designed for assigning tags to images for more accurate retrieval. Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image annotation applications.},

Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.},

In addition, we leverage features extracted from both online and offline communities to recommend ongoing events to attendees with different needs. Compared with the baseline method, people preferred public activities suggested by our heuristic rule-based method. Using a dataset collected from 45 participants, we found that the context-based approach for private group formation can attain a precision and recall of over 80%, and the usage of spatial-temporal contexts and group computing can have more than a 30% performance improvement over considering the interaction frequency between a user and related groups. A case study revealed that, by extracting the features such as dynamic intimacy and static intimacy, our cross-community approach for ongoing event recommendation can meet different user needs.},

For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) “viralets”, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including users’ comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.). 1

Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.

We first determine relevant and irrelevant images based on label information and construct relevant and irrelevant graphs by focusing on the visually similar relevant and irrelevant images. A linear feature transformation matrix is derived by considering the two graphs. The transformation can map the images to a low-dimensional subspace in which neighborhood relevant images are pulled closer while irrelevant images are pushed away. Thus the new feature after dimensionality reduction is quite fit for KNN-based image annotation. Experiments on the Corel dataset also demonstrate the effectiveness of our dimensionality reduction method for KNN-based image annotation.},

  abstract  = {Music auto-tagging refers to automatically assigning semantic labels (tags) such as genre, mood and instrument to music so as to facilitate text-based music retrieval. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {Pointwise label and pairwise label are both widely used in computer vision tasks. For example, supervised image classification and annotation approaches use pointwise label, while attribute-based image relative learning often adopts pairwise labels. These two types of labels are often considered independently and most existing efforts utilize them separately. However, pointwise labels in image classification and tag annotation are inherently related to the pairwise labels. For example, an image labeled with "coast" and annotated with "beach, sea, sand, sky" is more likely to have a higher ranking score in terms of the attribute "open", while "men shoes" ranked highly on the attribute "formal" are likely to be annotated with "leather, lace up" than "buckle, fabric". The existence of potential relations between pointwise labels and pairwise labels motivates us to fuse them together for jointly addressing related vision tasks. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between class labels, tags and attributes, and propose a novel framework PPP(Pointwise and Pairwise image label Prediction), which is based on overlapped group structure extracted from the pointwise-pairwise-label bipartite graph. With experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance on three vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

The starting point is to represent each music recording by its auditory temporal modulations. Then, an irregular third order tensor is formed. The first slice contains the vectorized training temporal modulations, while the second slice contains the corresponding multi-label vectors. The PARAFAC2 is employed to effectively harness the multi-label information for dimensionality reduction. Any vectorized test auditory representation of temporal modulations is first projected onto the semantic space derived via the PARAFAC2 and the coefficient vector is obtained. Then, the annotation vector is obtained by multiplying this coefficient vector by the left singular vectors of the second slice (i.e., the slice associated to the label vector). The proposed framework, outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 10-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

  abstract  = {In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

Given a set of training music recordings represented by the tag-music recording matrix having zero-one (indicator) vectors of the tags associated with each recording in its columns along with the matrix of the ATM representations in its columns, a low-rank weight matrix is sought, such that the tag-music recording matrix is expressed as the product of the weight matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations plus an error matrix. Clearly, such a weight matrix captures the relationships between the labels (i.e., tags) and the audio features. It can be derived by solving a convex nuclear norm minimization problem, if the tag-music recording matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations are assumed to be jointly low-rank. Having found the weight matrix, the annotation vector for labeling any test music recording can be obtained by multiplying the weight matrix with its ATM representation. The just outlined method is referred to as low-rank representation based multi-label annotation (LRRMA).

By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Therefore we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. To make our model more suitable for nonlinear separable features, we also extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Moreover, we also integrate our multi-layer group sparse coding with kNN strategy, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sports and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.},

In this framework, the association of a tag to a song is characterized in a “hard” fashion: the tag is either relevant or not. Yet, the relevance of a tag to a song is not always evident. Indeed, during the ground-truth annotation process, several annotators may express doubts, or disagree with each other. In this paper, we propose to fuse annotators' decisions in a way to keep information about this uncertainty. This fusion provides us continuous scores, that are used for training a regressive boosting algorithm. Our experiments show that regression with this soft ground truth leads to a more accurate learning, and better predictions, compared to traditionally used binary classification.},

  abstract  = {Automatic image annotation has drawn much attention in the last two decades due to its application in social images organization. Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Tags are semantic keywords that are assigned to an image. Image tagging enables the users of social media sharing platforms to annotate images, facilitating image search and content description. Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes.

  abstract  = {The availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. This paper discusses about an approach for automatic annotation in digital images. Some of the previous models for automatic image annotations are translation model (TM), continuous-space relevance model (CRM) and multiple Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM).These models have some semantic gap problems. To avoid these problems here developed a hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which is used to combine both low-level image features and user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based on the low-level image features. Low-level features are color, texture and shape. For images with user provided tags, HPM use both the image features and the tags to recommend additional tags to label the images. Here a Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) is used to capture both color and texture information. An L1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The kernel density estimation is accelerated by an Improved Fast Gauss transform(IFGT).When the number of images becomes larger then Tag-Image Association Matrix (TIAM) used in the HPM framework become very sparse, thus it is very difficult to estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. So a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for tackling this data sparsity issue. Here a CF algorithm is used to find the correlation between the words. Building such a HPM will make image labelling more efficient and less labour intensive.},

Typically, data-dependent branches are associated with program data structures, and follow store-load-branch execution sequence. A set of memory locations is written at an earlier point in a program. Later, these locations are read, and used for evaluating branch condition. Branch outcome depends on data values stored in data structure, which, typically do not have repeatable pattern. Therefore, in addition to history-based dynamic predictor, we need a different kind of predictor for handling such branches. This paper presents Store-Load-Branch (SLB) predictor; a compiler-assisted dynamic branch prediction scheme for data-dependent direct and indirect branches. For every data-dependent branch, compiler identifies store instructions that modify the data structure associated with the branch. Marked store instructions are dynamically tracked, and stored values are used for computing branch flags ahead of time. Branch flags are buffered, and later used for making predictions. On average, compared to standalone TAGE predictor, combined TAGE+SLB predictor reduces branch MPKI by 21% and 51% for SPECINT and EEMBC benchmark suites respectively.},

This paper presents FlierMeet, a crowd-powered sensing system for cross-space public information reposting, tagging, and sharing. The tags learned are useful for flier sharing and preferred information retrieval and suggestion. Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts. To evaluate our system, 38 participants were recruited and 2,035 reposts were captured during an eight-week period. Experiments on this dataset showed that our approach to flier grouping is effective and the proposed features are useful for flier category/semantic tagging.},

  abstract  = {An important aspect when sharing images in social networks is the tags the images are annotated with. Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

Nonetheless, most existing approaches use trust as a factor independent from time which we think that trust value between users is dynamic; hence it change over time. For this reason, we used friendship time and proposed a novel temporal-trust based approach called AgeTrust to measure trust value. To validate the proposed approach, we used Delicious data set and compared our approach with two other traditional trust-based approaches: traditional CF and FriendshipTrust.

In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity.

Traditional studies on prior knowledge generation during learning have focused on extracting sentences from reading materials that are manually generated by website administrators and educators. From the reports of previous studies, tag-based recommendation and assessment has been recognized as being an effective approach that can assist learners in finding out the clues and concepts of articles, such that it enables learners to be familiar with the learning content. However, sparse noisy data influences the quality of recommendations, especially for tag choices that are not mapped to the features of both the users and content. To cope with these problems, we adopt a hybrid recommendation method to consider tag preference, tag relevance and social networking. The experimental results show that the approach benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge, and can be an effective and efficient mechanism for enhancing the quality of prior knowledge recommendation.},

Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

With the help of such relationship, we can obtain the Topic-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and resources, and Interest-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and users.

The main goal of tweets classification and linking is to integrate all tweets that are related semantically in one place on the Web. The data inequality problems exist because authors post tweets and hashtag them based on their own preference. The authors can post tweets in different languages (English-Arabic). Therefore, the hashtags cannot be the only trackback function of the tweet to link it with the related tweets. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop an automated tweet classifier which is not limited by the language or the category of the tweet. The approach can create new suggested multilingual (English, Arabic) hashtags from tweet's content and comments "auto-tagging" in social linked open data (LOD), matching the tweets in the same topic and provides high accuracy and performance using blocking and indexing techniques. The proposed framework has substantial improvements in tweets classification and linking compared to state of the art framework of classifying and linking techniques with better classifying rate which reach 95% in precision and 97% in recall.},

Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering.

  abstract  = {Most of the organizations today generate and share textual descriptions of their products, services, and actions. Such textual collections consists of significant amount of structured information, which remains buried in the unstructured text. Even though information extraction algorithms provides the extraction of structured relations, they are often expensive and inaccurate. We present an alternative approach that facilitates the generation of the structured metadata which is useful for querying the database. Document annotations are comments, notes, or other types of external remarks that can be attached to a document. Our approach relies on the idea that humans can add the valuable metadata during creation time prompted by an interface. We can increase the quality of searching to some extent, if the documents are properly annotated. Existing probabilistic approaches have some demerits. This paper proposes an approach that uses inverted indexing scheme for effective mining of informations. Major contribution of this paper relies on the fact that annotates the document by utilizing the content of the document and query workload.},

These social tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanism which assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them, where tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item. In this paper, we propose an approach for tag recommendation based on users' interest lattice matching (UILM). UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing web pages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

However hashtags are highly ambiguous. Posts with the same hashtags are not always on the same topic. Moreover, hashtags are evolving, especially those related to illicit drugs. New street names are introduced constantly to avoid detection. In this paper, we employ topic modeling to disambiguate hashtags and track the changes of hashtags using semantic word embedding.

These networking spaces generally emerged from desktop applications for organizing bibliographic references to social networking environments setup to share and tag citations for scholars. Two of the most important reference management tools, Mendeley and Zotero, are described in detail. Mendeley has the largest bibliographic database where users can read and tag the publications that other members share in the public catalogue. However, its networking functionalities are hardly exploited at all, which casts serious doubts on its future as a social networking platform. Zotero, on the other hand, is a local, reduced platform occupied above all by American users from the Humanities and Social Sciences. Nevertheless, the great limitation of this platform is that it does not have a public catalogue of the references added to the service, which impedes the sharing of references between members. As a result of this users employ groups as the means to achieve collaboration. },

At the same time, usage patterns, in particular log analysis of digital library usage, are presented and compared to data generated from other types of digital environments. While users take leading roles in applying some search tactics, systems play dominant roles in other tactics. User engagement and system support for different types of search tactics in the search process are illustrated. Moreover, factors influencing digital library use are analyzed, including users’ personal infrastructure, types of tasks, and system design. },

However, the evolution of each has been opposed, taking them on different courses. While CiteULike was spreading across countries and disciplines, BibSonomy headed to becoming a specialized tool for computer scientists and limited to German-speaking countries. However, at the time that CiteULike is recording a deep stagnation with the gradual slowdown of its functions, Bibsonomy survives with high activity in a small niche. This chapter describes the principal functionalities of each service and analyses quantitatively their document repository, social instruments and user profiles. },

This chapter is devoted to explication of the typical or standard approaches to capturing the knowledge base of a community. How we go about capturing this knowledge base, specifically, is what constitutes our domain analytical methodology. A methodology is a plan for research that quite specifically lays out which tools will be used and why. Operational parameters for domain analytic research require that the context is in the first instance a unit of analysis for the construction of a knowledge organization system. Whether it is our intent immediately to construct such a system or to leave it for others in subsequent work, our purpose in unraveling the extension and intension of a domain is to ascertain the concepts and their characteristics that constitute the functional knowledge base of the community under consideration. The second consideration is that a domain is a group. Methodologically then, the unit of analysis must be, in some way, a visible functional group. The remaining aspects of a domain that can be extracted by analysis are an ontological base that reveals an underlying teleology; a set of common hypotheses; an epistemological consensus on methodological approaches; and, social semantics. Any or all of the empirical methods described in Chapter 4, such as term extraction, thematic analysis, and visualization of author cocitation clusters should point to these aspects of domain coherence. },

  abstract  = {Abstract Organizational dynamics are vital to digital curation, as the organization becomes a social, political, and intellectual context at various levels of collaboration. The extent of humanities and digital humanities scholarship at academic institutions translates into support for archives and special collections, as Digital Humanities faculty and students will, at different stages of their projects, use digital collections at their institutions’ archives and research libraries. The extent of digital curation initiatives ranges from one department—usually a combined archives and special collections unit—to multiple units including the archives, technical services, information technologists, academic departments, and the community at large. This chapter focuses on the organizational dimensions of digital curation, placing the digital curation lifecycle in a higher education institution’s context. It will discuss at length the role of knowledge architectures and knowledge transfer in digital curation in four distinct settings: archives, academic library, institution, and community. This approach aims to demonstrate the relationship of the digital lifecycle model to curation initiatives at various levels of the institution and surround communities. },

The scope and extent of curation programs vary from organization to organization and range from extensive curation initiatives at large institutions designating entire departments for digital curation to small-scale curation efforts at smaller institutions with a solo curator or none, with most curation initiatives falling between these extremes. This chapter will use the Digital Curation Centre's Lifecycle model as the framework for implementing digital curation programs from conceptualization activities to assessments. The chapter will also consider a broader conceptualization of curation; digital humanities curation and social curation play a crucial role in the construction of meanings around heritage collections, which positively impacts the usage statistics—therefore the relevance—of heritage collections. },

Libraries are adopting technological tools and approaches to closely fit library services to the lifestyles of their communities. One exemplar of such integration in the design and delivery of library services is the use of labels with deeper meanings to denote improved service models. A number of controversies hamper the adoption of such terms to label new ideas, models and techniques of librarianship, particularly the use of version numbers, largely exemplified by what some scholars call the ‘point oh’ phenomenon. This chapter explores these developments. },

We note that the pairwise object distance is only the low-level comparison that ignores the correlation among different 3-D objects. This distance may accordingly suffer from missed cross-object information. In recent years, learning methods have been superior in many applications, in which semi-supervised learning (SSL) can estimate the structure underlying both the labeled and unlabeled data. \{SSL\} is applicable to V3DOR. \{SSL\} methods can explore not only the pairwise object relevance but also the joint relevance among multiple objects. In the \{SSL\} framework, several recent works have introduced learning-based 3DOR methods. In this chapter, we briefly discuss these learning-based methods, including Hausdorff distance learning, bipartite graph optimal matching, and hypergraph learning. },

Although information architecture is not a substitute for curation or archiving, the field can effectively inform curators about the internal and extended structures of Web content requiring preservation and documentation. Curators may use structural and preservation metadata for such purposes. There is also a direct relationship between information architecture and hypertextuality, which represent several forms of hypertext in digital history projects. Understanding these forms will help curators assess the structure of large-scale projects and prepare proper documentation. This chapter focuses on the place of information architecture in digital curation where it helps curators assess the diverse structures of information spaces and the relationships of interrelated resources. },

  abstract  = {Abstract Digital technology has significantly influenced various archival and library functions, such as the development of digital heritage collections and virtual museums. The digitization of selections from special collections, manuscripts, photographs, and other historical media has made it possible for worldwide audiences to access information about places, communities, people, and events. Social media has made it even easier for audiences to interact with the content and network with others to discuss their ancestry, inquire about places, and share information about upcoming events. This chapter focuses on implications of social networks for digital curation and addresses social curation ecosystems. Cross-curation results from the ability of social media to connect audiences across networks via automatic feeds and human-initiated actions, increasing the virality of topics, which in turn outlines a social curation ecosystem where actions in one region of the system can have varying effects elsewhere. Social networks are different in design, attracting different audiences, but connecting them across the various networks will enable curators to reach out to a wider audience. The projects at the Ward M. Canaday Center, especially Toledo's Attic, emphasizes the potential value of social media in the work of heritage institutions. },

This chapter therefore describes the processes by which the library community reaches out towards other communities, such as those of museums and archives as part of the cultural heritage sector and the publishing and rights management community. It also describes the potential of controlled vocabularies or authoritative sources of information which can be shared, reused, and function as nodes of linked data not only by libraries but also by other communities. In the final part of the chapter the impact that the users of social networks as well as machines have on generating metadata as linked open data will be discussed. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: In this chapter, after a quick history of MIR’s principles, a series of clarifications on the state-of-the-art developments and the problems arising from such studies are presented. Some important future directions of study and research are then indicated. With regard to the usefulness of MIR’s methods, it is pointed out how research and experimentation for improving the structure and methodology of systems should always be based on the actual needs of users, and their responses to the new operational proposals. In investigating the actual functionality of \{MIR\} systems, the discussion of the limitations of the contentual objective access to documents is decisive and mathematically objective, as is the discussion of the gap between it and the conceptual-interpretive access, both internationally appointed as the semantic gap. Since the meaning of a multimedia document is rarely explicit, the goal of the system must be to provide support to overcome this gap between the simplicity of content processing offered by the machine and the rich semantic expectations of the user. A suggested solution is integrating into \{MIR\} the method of the ontologies, new guides for navigating the Semantic Web. It is about establishing a truly organic approach to multimedia search, able to take into account univocally the concrete and conceptual, the contentual and semantic representativeness of documents. Finally, accepting as a solution the use of ontologies as being compatible with MIR, to escape their rigours it is hypothetically valid to combine ontologies with folksonomies as systems for the free collaborative content categorization of documents based on labels assigned directly by end-users. The integration between the semantic tools of ontologies and folksonomies, which in turn are integrated with content-based tools, can reconcile the opposition between the principles of semantic-interpretative treatments and contentual objective treatments in the general organic tools of MIR. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: Since web catalogs completely eliminated card catalogs in the 1990s there has been little substantive change in the way they work. All of them have the traditional card catalog searches, as well as keyword. There is an option to refine searches to bring in a more focused, manageable set, but extensive research has shown that this option is almost never taken. This chapter shows that as the twenty-first century saw the rise of Google, the expectations of library users changed, with more patrons being dissatisfied with the classic online catalog, which they saw as containing too much library jargon. It looks at the rise of a new type of catalog that overlaid the classic catalog and delivered a more intuitive look. It had tag clouds and facets to limit the results to certain types of material or locations. Since libraries were running both types of catalogs simultaneously, it was easy to find out if they were more likely to limit a search in a discovery catalog. Several libraries reported that users were 20 times more likely to refine a search in a discovery catalog. },

After a short excursus on the main ongoing transformations of science, the chapter, adopting a systemic perspective of analysis of both science and its communication processes, identifies some distinctive and functional traits of open science and their potential impact on innovative approaches to scholarly information literacy. },

  abstract  = {Abstract Semantics plays an important role in the accurate analysis of the context of a sentiment expression. We analyze this role from two perspectives: the way semantics is encoded in sentiment resources, such as lexica, corpora, and ontologies, and the way it is used by automatic systems that perform sentiment analysis on social media data. Specifically, we review and discuss state-of-the-art methods and tools that rely on semantic models and resources, possibly enabling reasoning, so as to deal with some key challenges for sentiment analysis. Examples of such challenges are context dependency and finer-grained sentiment detection, which can translate into the assigning of sentiment values to aspects of objects or into the design and use of a wider spectrum of affective labels, or the use of current techniques in finer-grained semantic processing. In our dealing with semantics, lexical aspects must be combined with pragmatic and cognitive issues, and other dimensions involved in conveying sentiment, such as emotions. },

  abstract  = {Abstract With the rapid advances in multimedia, communication, and Internet technology, today there is an ever-increasing amount of multimedia content with rich metadata tags on the Web. Of this massive multimedia data, image and video data represent major proportions and contain rich content information, which is very accessible for human observation and manipulation. Image and video datasets are also widely used in medical analysis, digital libraries, computer vision, and intelligent vehicles. Consequently, how to organize such digital media toward effective indexing and search is recognized as one of the fundamental challenges in the above fields, with a bright future in both academic and industrial research. Consequently, due to the incomplete annotations of multimedia data on the Web, there is a huge semantic gap between the image/video content and its textual/semantic description, which has been the core problem in multimedia analysis research thus far. Generally speaking, photographing operation from a real-world three-dimensional scene into a two-dimensional \{RGB\} image is an irreversible process that introduces problems in image and video content understanding, as well as visual search and recognition applications. Therefore, the representation, indexing and search techniques of image and video data has been a longstanding focus in research fields such as computer vision, multimedia analysis, and information retrieval, while serving as an emerging demand to improve the multimedia search services for big companies such as Google and Yahoo!. },

The changing forms and structures of information, its origins, the emergence of preferred and consensual information, the knowledge and ignorance of the contexts of its emergence and the experiences of abundance and scarcity of information all affect our possibilities to know things. Digital information is not restricted by the limits of physical space even though its users are still very much physical beings. It is created and made available in new forms, which have very little in common with the old representations of information. Information emerged in new environments in new ways and the information we retrieve for our daily pursuits of knowing is also filtered and channelled in new ways. A highly complex and unclear notion of relevance has become a guiding principle of the choice of information, even if we know very little of how and why we are consulting one particular piece of information instead of another. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: Semantic Web technologies have not replicated the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. The underlying problems are the inability of keywords to express the semantics of a query, and the functional possibilities and limitations of web applications. Searching for information is difficult and time intensive because of the lower efficiency of keyword-based search; results are often very different from the information seeker’s expectations/requirements. The human mind understands and processes information in multiple dimensions, thus the search method should also involve multiple facets. Facet analysis has been applied to knowledge organization in library and information science and also in artificial intelligence for the design of information retrieval systems. A simplified model to interface between users, information depositors, data repositories, and search engines could lead to the development of a tool which is understandable to both machine and human. The model would be based on the concept of facets and facetization so as to handle the conceptual aspect, and would also be translated to Semantic Web languages for comprehensibility by robots and crawlers. },

  abstract = {The system presented in this article aims to improve information access through the use of semantic annotation utilizing a non-traditional approach. Instead of applying semantic annotations to enhance the internal information access mechanisms, we use them to empower the user of an information access system through an innovative named entity-based user interface – NameSieve. NameSieve was built to support an intelligence analyst during the process of exploratory search, an advanced type of search requiring multiple iterations of retrieval interleaved with browsing and analyzing the retrieved information. The proposed approach was implemented in the NameSieve system so that the system can transparently present a summary of search results in the form of entity “clouds.” Therefore, these clouds allow the analyst to further explore the results in a novel manner, acting together as a faceted browsing interface. We ran a user study (with ten subjects) to examine the effect of NameSieve, and the study results reported in the paper demonstrate that this new way of applying semantic annotation information was actively used and was evaluated positively by the subjects. It enabled the subjects to work more productively and bring back most relevant documents.},

  abstract        = {Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  note            = {cited By},
  abstract        = {As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction, very useful for capturing the semantics of information repositories, but they can not reflect the user's interest. The user in KAM can freely choose the words to tag the resources which are the reflection of the user's own interest. The set of tags and tagged knowledge of a user comprise the personomy. In a group the shared tags and knowledge are known as folksonomy. Our approach investigates how to map these tags in personomy and folksonomy to existing domain ontology in order to add accurate meanings. The user's behaviors are also used to re-rank the query results. So the user can find the useful knowledge quickly and accurately.},

One of the main deficiencies comes from the tagging behaviour of different users which causes semantic heterogeneity in tagging. As a consequence a user cannot benefit from the adequate tagging of others. In order to solve the problem, an agent-based reconciliation knowledge system, based on Formal Concept Analysis, is applied to facilitate the semantic interoperability between personomies.

While a web object itself is not divisible and independent with each other, a set consists of separable objects that are related in some aspects. This paper proposes a new approach that can effectively measure topical relevance of sets against a user query by utilizing the tags attached to web objects. The main idea of the proposed approach is to prefer the set which covers as many query related subtopics as possible. In particular, in order to compute the topical relevance while addressing the problem of noisy tags, the notion of tag significance score is introduced based on tag co-occurrence frequency. We consider a problem domain of photo set search at flickr.com where individual photos are annotated with texts such as titles and tags.

However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

In order to extract semantics of tags, we developed the emotion ontology for music called UniEmotion, which categorizes tags into positive emotional tags, negative emotional tags, and factual tags. According to the types of the tags, their weights are calculated and assigned to them. After then, user profiles using the weighted tags were generated and a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm was executed. To evaluate our approach, a data set of 1,100 users, tags which they added, and artists which they listened to was collected from last.fm. The conventional track-based recommendation, the unweighted tag-based recommendation, and the weighted tag-based recommendation are compared in terms of precision. Our experimental results show that the weighted tag-based recommendation outperforms other two approaches in terms of precision. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Background: Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. Objective: The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. Methods: First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. Results: Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.},

  abstract        = {The rapid growth of the so-called Web 2.0 has changed the surfers' behavior. A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We discuss several plausible heuristics people might employ to decide on tags to use for a given item, and then describe methods for testing evidence of such strategies in real collaborative tagging data. Using a large dataset of annotations collected from users of the social music website Last.fm with a novel crawling methodology (approximately one millions total users), we extract the parameters for our decision-making models from the data. We then describe a set of simple multi-agent simulations that test our heuristic models, and compare their results to the extracted parameters from the tagging dataset. Results indicate that simple social copying mechanisms can generate surprisingly good fits to the empirical data, with implications for the design and study of tagging systems.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems allow users to describe and organize items using labels in a free-shared vocabulary (tags), improving their browsing experience in large collections of items. At present, the most accurate collaborative filtering techniques build user profiles in latent factor spaces that are not interpretable by users. In this paper, we propose a general method to build linear-interpretable user profiles that can be used for user interaction in a recommender system, using the well-known simple additive weighting model (SAW) for multi-attribute decision making. In experiments, two kinds of user profiles where tested: one from free contributed tags and other from keywords automatically extracted from textual item descriptions. We compare them for their ability to predict ratings and their potential for user interaction. As a test bed, we used a subset of the database of the University of Minnesota's movie review system-Movielens, the social tags proposed by Vig et al. (2012) in their work "The Tag Genome", and movie synopses extracted from the Netflix's API. We found that, in "warm" scenarios, the proposed tag and keyword-based user profiles produce equal or better recommendations that those based on latent-factors obtained using matrix factorization. Particularly, the keyword-based approach obtained 5.63% of improvement. In cold-start conditions-movies without rating information, both approaches perform close to average. Moreover, a user profile visualization is proposed arising an accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff between tag and keyword-based profiles. While keyword-based profiles produce more accurate recommendations, tag-based profiles seems to be more readable, meaningful and convenient for creating profile-based user interfaces.

These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions-from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E steps technique-Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution-which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy-expressed in a FO-to support ontology review and enhancement.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular tools for Web search users to find their desired information. Indeed, the informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. The widely keyword-based approaches used for locating information on the Web, are hence not straightforwardly adaptable to folksonomies. This drawback has created the need for an effective framework to support folksonomy users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this paper is to propose an integrated approach for context-aware query recommendation infolksonomies that exploits the power of both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and triadic concepts. We demonstrate through carried out experiments that the proposed approach yields mainly highly Precise and highly Relevant tag query recommendation.},

Both sustainability and stabilization are essential to the mining and categorization of information driven by tagging behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on time series data of CiteULike from November 2004 to April 2010. Power law distributions were detected to reveal statistical regularities and tagging patterns. Logistic regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted to identify the factors affecting the growth of distinct tags for articles. The significance of the effects and the time taken for a given article to reach its tagging maturity were also explored. Findings - Time series plots and trend analysis illustrated the continuous growth of the tagging system. Exploratory analysis of power law distribution fittings indicated a sign of system stability known as scale invariance. Logistic regression results demonstrated that for a particular article, the number of users who tagged the article, the initial date when the article was tagged, and the life span of the article are statistically significant to the ratio of the distinct tag number to the total tag number for a given article. These results confirmed that the distinct tag ratio of an article gives rise to a stable pattern. Originality/value - Though extensive work has been done on the patterns of tag vocabulary, it is not clear how the growth of distinctive tags behaves in relation to the total number of tag applications, considering time-dependent covariates such as the number of users, and the longevity of an article. This paper sets to complement the literature on the existing methodology and investigate this property in detail. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Past work has addressed such prob- lems individually for specific applications, but has lacked a generalizable framework for performing both classification and prediction of topic usage. Our approach is to model a topic as a temporally ordered sequence of derived feature states and capture characteristic changes in the topic trend. These sequences are drawn from a dynamic segmentation of frequency data based on change point analysis. We employ Partitioning Around Medoids clustering on these segments to produce signatures which highlight characteristic patterns of usage growth and decay. We demonstrate how this signa- ture model can be used to define distinctive classes of topics in multiple online contexts, including tagging systems and web-based information retrieval. Additionally, we show how the model can predict the general trajectory of interest in a particular topic. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Originally introduced by social bookmarking systems, collaborative tagging, or social tagging, has been widely adopted by many web-based systems like wikis, e-commerce platforms, or social networks. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

New classification, compilation, and recommendation systems based on the use of folksonomies and ontologies have appeared to deal with the requirements of data management in this environment. Nevertheless, using ontologies alone has some weaknesses due to the need of being statically modeled by a set of experts in a specific domain. On the other hand, folksonomies show a lack of formality because of their implicit ambiguity and flexibility by definition.

  abstract        = {A new collaborative approach in information organization and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI), which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric. The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree. The results of this study can be applicable to the study of filtering social tags based on CI; filtered social tags may be utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging has emerged as an efficient way to semantically describe online resources shared by a community of users. However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users. We analyze the performance of two probabilistic approaches to recommend tags from users with similar tagging behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

  abstract        = {Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

As the large majority of users enters only very few tags, good tag recommendation can vastly improve the usability of tags for techniques such as searching, indexing, and clustering. Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

The problem we consider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying on information-theoretic concepts, we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity, and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard, and we propose a greedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is equipped with strategies for pruning the search space deriving directly from the objective function. We also prove a property that allows assessing the level of informativeness for newly added dimensions, thus allowing to define criteria for terminating the decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets with known dimension and three real-world datasets, flickr, del. icio. us and dblp. The problem we study is largely motivated by applications in the domain of collaborative tagging; however, the mining task we introduce in this paper is useful in other application domains as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

One means for mitigating this instance of the information overload phenomenon are collaborative tagging systems, that allow users to select, share and annotate references to publications. These systems employ recommendation algorithms to present to their users personalized lists of interesting and relevant publications. In this paper we analyze different ways to incorporate social data and metadata from collaborative tagging systems into the graph-based ranking algorithm FolkRank to utilize it for recommending scientific articles to users of the social bookmarking system BibSonomy. We compare the results to those of Collaborative Filtering, which has previously been applied for resource recommendation. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Folksonomies have shown to contain information that is beneficial for resource recommendation. However, as folksonomies are not designed to support recommendation tasks, there are drawbacks of the various recommendation techniques. Graphbased recommendation in folksonomies for example suffers from the problem of concept drift. Vector space based recommendation approaches in folksonomies suffer from sparseness of available data. In this paper, we propose the exible framework VSScore which incorporates context-specific information into the recommendation process to tackle these issues. Additionally, as an alternative to the evaluation methodology LeavePostOut we propose an adaptation Leave- RTOut for resource recommendation in folksonomies. In a subset of resource recommendation tasks evaluated, the proposed recommendation framework VSScore performs signifi cantly more effective than the baseline algorithm FolkRank.

In this demo, we will present the ongoing development of a novel real-time search and discovery service named Yokie1 (http://yok.ie, early technology description originally published in [1]). Yokie uses the large volume of hyperlink-laden messages on social networks like Twitter as the basis of its content and ranking systems. Curated sets of users (or "Search Parties") form the basis of sourcing the content from the networks, and the metadata of the containing messages form the basis of ranking and contextual retrieval of the hyperlinks. Each hyperlink is indexed with a compound set of terms from multiple tweets (should the given hyperlink be shared more than once). This indexing step is a novel example of collaborative tagging of resources. The application is live with more than 100 users, who have performed approximately 1000 queries. We will demonstrate the main techniques and novel ranking and retrieval techniques and user features. Copyright © 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM).},

  abstract        = {Popular Internet document repositories, such as online newspapers, digital libraries, and blogs store large amount of text and image data that are frequently accessed by large number of users. Users' input through collaborative commenting or tagging can be very useful in organizing and classifying documents. Some web sites (e.g. Google Image Labeler) support a collection of tags and labels, but a large fraction of these sites do not currently support such activities. Moreover, relying upon centrally controlled web-service providers for such support is probably not a good idea if the objective is to make the collaborative inputs publicly available. Often, business entities offering such web-based tagging environments end up owning and monetizing the result of the collective effort. This paper takes a step toward addressing this problem-it proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (PADMINI), powered by distributed data mining algorithms. In particular, it focuses on learning a P2P classifier from tagged text data. This paper describes the PADMINI system and the distributed text classifier learning components; text classification is posed as a linear program and an asynchronous distributed algorithm is used to solve it. It also presents extensive empirical results on text data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proposal abstract database. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

More precisely, we propose a multi-layer framework where data collected by social tagging communities are complemented with additional services. Such services provide users the ability of expressing their dis/agreement with existing tags, denoting the members they trust based on their characteristics and relationships, or specifying policies on which "quality" assessment of resources should be returned.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites, facilitating ordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i. e., Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We use this methodology for evaluating how tag recommendations coming from (1) the popular tags at a resource or from (2) the user's own vocabulary influence the indexing quality.

In order to analyze and compare these initiatives we present here an abstract framework. It supports our argument that existing approaches do not explore the full potential of the combination between folksonomies and ontologies due to their unidirectionality. The framework is also the basis to evidence that a fusion approach - -as proposed in our "folksonomized ontology" - -enables to better explore the organic semantics of folksonomies combined to the engineered semantics of ontologies. © 2012 ACM.},

The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items from a public pool of items (e.g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a query should be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers' search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully-personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). © 2012 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. In this paper an intelligent tag recommendation agent is proposed, that recommends tags for bookmarks stored in one of the popular social bookmarking websites, Del.ici.ou.1 We develop various probabilistic approaches to recommend tags to be used by users while adding new bookmarks. We have developed content-based and collaborative filtering mechanism that are used by these recommendation agents. Additionally, these tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. This approach can therefore be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for social networks. We also empirically verify the hypothesis that similar web pages are tagged with similar tags. We also present a comparison between the proposed recommendation approaches for the agents. © 2012 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Due to the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, the research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other related concepts is becoming an important interdisciplinary area with great potential and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely 'flat', while in some cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags. However, usually no overall hierarchical organization of the tags is given, and one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there are also other types of tagged networks available for research, where the tags are already organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the 'is a sub-category of' type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper, we study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes marked by the tags in various real networks. The motivation for this research was the fact that understanding the tagging based on a known hierarchy can help in revealing the hidden hierarchy of tags in collaborative tagging systems.We analyse the relation between the tagfrequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG (i.e. their rank or significance as characterized by, e.g., the length of the branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features of tag co-occurrence. This model has high potential for further practical applications, e.g., it can provide the starting point for a benchmark system in ontology retrieval or it may help pinpoint unusual correlations in the co-occurrence of tags. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%. © 2012 ACM.},

SynTag generates real-time thumbnails by using real-time tags for presenters to receive instant feedback and for other users to retrieve presentation videos. In a pilot study, we found our users' tagging behaviors significantly different when they were in lecture events or discussion events.

As a kind of descriptive keyword, large amount of tags are created and associated to multiple types of resources, e. g., web pages, photos, videos and tweets. Users' tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing the temporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web. Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However, there exist remarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect bursty tagging event, which captures the relations among a group of correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It profiles the events with more representative and comprehensible clues. The proposed approach is divided into three stages. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events. We discuss the choice of similarity and granularity for event detection. After that, we further utilize an automatically generated tag taxonomy to organize bursty events to facilitate the burst oriented navigation and analysis. The experimental study on a large real data set demonstrates the superiority of our new approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In such cases collecting community descriptions in forms of structured tags can be a more affordable approach to describe Web services. However, little is understood about how tagging impacts performance of retrieval. There are neither real structured tagging systems for Web services, nor real corpora of structured tags. To start addressing these issues, in our approach, we motivated taggers to tag services in a partially controlled environment. Specifically, taggers were given application requirements and asked to find and tag services that match the requirements. Tags collected in this way were used for Web service matchmaking and evaluated within the framework of the Cross-Evaluation Track of the Third Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest. As part of the lessons learned, we explain relations between description schema (SWS, tags, flat document) and matchmaking heuristics, and performance of retrieval in different search scenarios. We also analyze reliability of tagging system performance as related to taggers/searchers autonomy. Finally, we identify threats to results credibility stemming from partial control of the tags collection process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

  abstract        = {In recent years, there is a fast proliferation of collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems in Web 2.0 communities. With the increasingly large amount of data, how to assist users in searching their interested resources by utilizing these semantic tags becomes a crucial problem. Collaborative tagging systems provide an environment for users to annotate resources, and most users give annotations according to their perspectives or feelings. However, users may have different perspectives or feelings on resources, e.g., some of them may share similar perspectives yet have a conflict with others. Thus, modeling the profile of a resource based on tags given by all users who have annotated the resource is neither suitable nor reasonable. We propose, to tackle this problem in this paper, a community-aware approach to constructing resource profiles via social filtering. In order to discover user communities, three different strategies are devised and discussed. Moreover, we present a personalized search approach by combining a switching fusion method and a revised needs-relevance function, to optimize personalized resources ranking based on user preferences and user issued query. We conduct experiments on a collected real life dataset by comparing the performance of our proposed approach and baseline methods. The experimental results verify our observations and effectiveness of proposed method. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

But who are the taggers, and does their language represent that of the user population? Some language theorists believe that inherent variables, such as gender or race, can be responsible for language use, whereas other researchers endorse more multiply-influenced practice-based approaches, where interactions with others affect language use more than a single variable. To explore whether linguistic variation in tagging is influenced more by gender or context, in this exploratory study, I will analyze the content and quantity of tags used on LibraryThing. This study seeks to dismantle stereotypical views of women's language use and to suggest a community of practice-based approach to analyzing social tags.},

Spontaneously generated information has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. New technologies, such as blogs, Twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, enable the creation and dissemination of content in a relatively simple way. As a result, the aggregate body of knowledge is growing at an accelerated rate. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Research has shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. Research has shown that individuals respond quickly and massively to emergencies, and that they try to help with the situation. Thus, it seems like a logical step to attempt to harness collective knowledge for emergency management. Disaster relief groups and field command frequently suffer from lack of up to date information, which may be critical in a rapidly evolving situation. Some of this information could be generated by the crowd at large, enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for the introduction of collective knowledge in disaster relief and present architecture and examples of how this could be accomplished. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A set of descriptive tags has to be manually entered by users whenever they post a resource. This process can be simplified by the use of tag recommendation systems. Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

This forms a quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings. Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

In this paper, MTag is presented as a new model for collaborative tagging in medical blogs, i.e. tagging blog entries with medical information. MTag includes two modules: the service module and the semantic module. The service module enables health professionals provide blog posts with auto-completed tags that represent actual medical terms and categorize their tags. Tags are mapped to URIs from online medical knowledge datasets to clarify their medical meaning. At the same time, the semantic module is equipped with a tag ontology which extends the Social Semantic Cloud of Tags (SCOT) ontology to consent medical specifications of tags. Eventually, a prototype is developed to test the MTag's two modules. The results show that both modules are working properly. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract        = {The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context.

Several information management approaches, such as desktop search, document organization and (collaborative) document tagging have been proposed to address this, however they are either inappropriate or inefficient. Automated collaborative document tagging approaches mitigate the problems of manual tagging, but they are usually based on centralized settings which are plagued by problems such as scalability, privacy, etc. To resolve these issues, we present P2P DocTagger, an automated and distributed document tagging system based on classification in P2P networks. P2P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval.

The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

Are the tags created by experts demonstrably superior to those of non-experts, and when non-experts have to be used for tagging, is it better to rely on tags created by those who upload videos or on others who watch the videos? Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

  abstract        = {Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a new knowledge propagation scheme to automatically propagate keywords from a subset of annotated images to the unannotated ones. The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation. Experimental results using 100 concept categories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging services (folksonomies) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era. They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

The collection of these annotations and the way they connect users and resources produce a rich information space for users to explore. However the size, complexity and chaotic structure of these systems hamper users as they search for information. Recommenders can assist the user by suggesting resources, tags or even other users. Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions. Information channels can be used to explain the effectiveness of individual recommenders or explain the relative contribution of components in the hybrid recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages. Results of experiments carried out on a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy, show that the use of content-based techniques improves the predictive accuracy of the tag recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web.

Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile.

  abstract        = {Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

The current study aims to study how the intra-personal consistency of tagging can be improved by proper tag visualization. The effects of visualization of tag frequency and visualization of the relevancy among tags on personal tagging consistency are empirically tested and compared through an experiment with 39 participants. The results show that visualization of tag relevancy improves tagging consistency significantly and reduces mental workload simultaneously; visualization of tag frequency may alleviate perceived physical demand when tag relevancy is visualized.

Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

  abstract      = {Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

  abstract        = {As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, music genre classification has attracted considerable research attention. Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

  abstract        = {Considering the natural tendency of people to follow direct or indirect cues of other people's activities, collaborative filtering-based recommender systems often predict the utility of an item for a particular user according to previous ratings by other similar users. Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

  abstract      = {The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity to explore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of a network of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers. Our results are supported by extensive experiments on del.icio.us datasets. © 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

We also put forward the necessary data standards to interoperate at both data format and semantic levels. We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms.

In this paper, we propose a tag recommender which relies on the content analysis of the resource to be tagged, as well as on the personal and collective tagging history. The main contribution of this work is a model which combines semantic content analysis methods with existing suggestive tagging techniques.

Being the scenario similar to traditional recommender systems where nearest neighbor algorithms, better known as collaborative filtering, were extensively and successfully applied, the application of the same methods to the problem of tag recommendation seems to be a natural way to follow. However, it is necessary to take into consideration some particularities of these systems, such as the absence of ratings and the fact that two entity types in a rating scale correspond to three top level entity types, i.e., user, resources and tags. In this paper we cast the tag recommendation problem into a collaborative filtering perspective and starting from a view on the plain recommendation task without attributes, we make a ground evaluation comparing different tag recommender algorithms on real data.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique.

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

We performed field observation and preliminary studies to examine how designers interpret visualized information in group work. We found that traditional classification methods have some problems like lack of surface and time consuming. Based on this research, we developed PC based group work application, named I-VIDI. By implementing I-VIDI based on functional requirements, we have showed how I-VIDI reduces problems found from current image classification methods such as KJ clustering and MDS. In future case study, we plan to conduct extensive user research to evaluate the system further as well as adding more functions which can be usefully applied to collaborative design work. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

With KeepUP, we outline the design of a recommendation process that is based on an implicit social network where the relevancy and meaning of information can be negotiated not only with the recommender system but also with other users.

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare two recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, We show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods.

Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Since the mid-2000s, systems, applications, tools and websites that facilitate connecting, collaborating and information sharing – often referred to as ‘Web 2.0’ – have become the norm throughout much of the Internet. Users expect to be able to connect with information in ways that are different from what was typical in the early or pre-Internet world where people were restricted to playing the role of information consumer. This shift from passive consumption to active interaction has important implications in terms of information and knowledge management. These implications, particularly when applied to the work environment, have raised new challenges within information and knowledge management – challenges that are best addressed through the application of digital curation. Digital curation is a developing field within information science, situated at the intersection of information management, knowledge management, communication and technology. Digital curation work aims to add value and meaning to digital content. },

This chapter examines the future of information literacy and how librarians could redefine their role by expanding it to include management of scientific information and research data, different instruction formats, and new approaches for assessing student learning. This will make library instruction a much more appealing, engaging, and useful experience for students and researchers. Responding to the needs of a generation born into a digital culture will require that librarians learn new skills and play new roles in supporting the educational and research goals of their institutions be redefined. },

For example, dramatic changes in work practices must have resulted from the introduction of the telephone. Public service employees began making extensive use of the internet and the web in about 2000. One key development, dating from about 2009, is the desire by senior politicians for the public to become more involved with government through online interaction. Taken to its extreme, theoretically, all major decisions could be made by citizens effectively instantaneously, by online voting. The information technology that is the subject of this book is Web 2.0, which concerns the ability to share information on the web, for users, especially the general public, to collaborate. The significance of Web 2.0 is outlined, and the participation–collaboration pattern, the declarative living pattern and the tag gardening pattern are explained. Social media and social networking are briefly summarized. },

This results in post-hoc metadata with each user contributing, via a network effect, to metadata diversity. However, standards-based, a priori, metadata restricts users’ involvement and ensures consistent structures and quality. These approaches though, are not necessarily in opposition. Combining both, into a mixed metadata system, unlocks the potential for metadata diversity and scalability whilst maintaining hierarchical and semantic structure. This changes the underlying principles for metadata systems, to consider variable user participation, aggregation and provenance, along with a change in the definition of quality so that it focuses on findability or usefulness. },

Recent research confirmed that the process of audio feature extraction and selection is critical for the overall system performance. In the current work, the feature extraction procedure is applied in each audio channel of stereo radio programmes separately in order to exploit the differences of audio information between channels. Feature ranking algorithms are employed, aiming to investigate the saliency of the feature differences.

  abstract  = {Up to now, the problem of ensuring collaborative activities in e-Learning against dishonest students' behaviour has been mainly tackled with technological security solutions. Over the last years, technological security solutions have evolved from isolated security approaches based on specific properties, such as privacy, to holistic models based on technological security comprehensive solutions, such as public key infrastructures, biometric models and multidisciplinary approaches from different research areas. Current technological security solutions are feasible in many e-Learning scenarios but on-line assessment involves certain requirements that usually bear specific security challenges related to e-Learning design. In this context, even the most advanced and comprehensive technological security solutions cannot cope with the whole scope of e-Learning vulnerabilities. To overcome these deficiencies, our previous research aimed at incorporating information security properties and services into on-line collaborative e-Learning by a functional approach based on trustworthiness assessment and prediction. In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer on-line assessment approach carried out in a real on-line course developed in our real e-Learning context of the Open University of Catalonia. The design presented in this paper is conducted by our trustworthiness security methodology with the aim of building peer-to-peer collaborative activities, which enhances security e-Learning requirements. Eventually, peer-to-peer visualizations methods are proposed to manage security e-Learning events, as well as on-line visualization through peer-to-peer tools, intended to analyse collaborative relationship.},

In this context, e-Learning stakeholders, are increasingly demanding new requirements, among them, information security is considered as a critical factor involved in on-line collaborative processes. Information security determines the accurate development of learning activities, especially when a group of students carries out on-line assessment, which conducts to grades or certificates, in these cases, IS is an essential issue that has to be considered. To date, even most advances security technological solutions have drawbacks that impede the development of overall security e-Learning frameworks. For this reason, this paper suggests enhancing technological security models with functional approaches, namely, we propose a functional security model based on trustworthiness and collective intelligence. Both of these topics are closely related to on-line collaborative learning and on-line assessment models. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to discover how security can be enhanced with trustworthiness in an on-line collaborative learning scenario through the study of the collective intelligence processes that occur on on-line assessment activities. To this end, a peer-to-peer public student's profile model, based on trustworthiness is proposed, and the main collective intelligence processes involved in the collaborative on-line assessments activities, are presented.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community Web sites.},

This paper addresses the use of one of the most widely known social networking tool, Facebook as a learning tool for higher education students, with emphasis to developing countries such as Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to identify student's perception on using Facebook as a learning tool. Activity theory is adopted as a conceptual framework and analytical tool to demonstrate students' perceptions in using Facebook. Survey was distributed to evaluate on students' perceptions in using Facebook. The outcome of the survey is certainly helpful to determine the future trend of using online social networking tools as a learning tool in higher education.},

ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing relations between tags.},

A technique called SCM/THD investigated in this paper extracts entities from free-text annotations, and using the Lin similarity measure over the WordNet thesaurus classifies them into a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hypernyms extracted from Wikipedia are used to map uncommon entities to Wordnet synsets. In collaborative environments, users can assign multiple annotations to the same object hence increasing the amount of information available. Assuming that the semantics of the annotations overlap, this redundancy can be exploited to generate higher quality tags. A preliminary experiment presented in the paper evaluates the consistency and quality of tags generated from multiple annotations of the same image. The results obtained on an experimental dataset comprising of 62 annotations from four annotators show that the accuracy of a simple majority vote surpasses the average accuracy obtained through assessing the annotations individually by 18%. A moderate-strength correlation has been found between the quality of generated tags and the consistency of annotations.},

Knowledge recommender system (KRS) is an efficient way to decrease information overload, and the user model is very critical for KRS. This paper proposes a method to establish a user model based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In detail, we first select the keywords from knowledge databases, and then represent knowledge items with Vector Space Model (VSM). Next, for a certain user, the VSM of all scanned knowledge items and related scores rated by the user are combined together to be a new matrix, named as Vector Space Model with Rating(VSMR,with dimension of m times n), where the first n-1 columns represent the VSM of the items, and the final column lists the scores given by the user. And then the GMM-based user model is trained with VSMR. Finally, the trained user model is used to predict the user's ratings on the knowledge items and the items with the higher score are considered as user's interest, which will be recommended to the user. The proposed method is validated by two experiments, which indicate that the method works well.},

However, the applicability of many solutions developed in this field is hampered by the costs associated with semantically annotating large repositories of Web services. To overcome this gap we propose a practical method for semantically annotating collections of XML Schemas and Web service interfaces. We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.},

  abstract  = {Tagging technique is widely used to annotate objects in Web 2.0 applications. Tags can support web service understanding, categorizing and discovering, which are important tasks in a service-oriented software system. However, most of existing web services' tags are annotated manually. Manual tagging is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tag web services automatically. Our approach consists of two tagging strategies, tag enriching and tag extraction. In the first strategy, we cluster web services using WSDL documents, and then we enrich tags for a service with the tags of other services in the same cluster. Considering our approach may not generate enough tags by tag enriching, we also extract tags from WSDL documents and related descriptions in the second step. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, a series of experiments are carried out based on web-scale web services. The experimental results show that our tagging method is effective, ensuring the number and quality of generated tags. We also show how to use tagging results to improve the performance of a web service search engine, which can prove that our work in this paper is useful and meaningful.},

Taking advantage of the repetitive nature of modern information and online media databases with independent annotation instances, we present an approach to automatically annotate multimedia documents that uses mining techniques to discover new annotations from similar documents and to filter existing incorrect annotations. The annotation set is not limited to words that have training data or for which models have been created. It is limited only by the words in the collective annotation vocabulary of all the database documents. A graph reinforcement method driven by a particular modality (e.g., visual) is used to determine the contribution of a similar document to the annotation target. The graph supplies possible annotations of a different modality (e.g., text) that can be mined for annotations of the target. Experiments are performed using videos crawled from YouTube. A customized precision-recall metric shows that the annotations obtained using the proposed method are superior to those originally existing for the document. These extended, filtered tags are also superior to a state-of-the-art semi-supervised technique for graph reinforcement learning on the initial user-supplied annotations.},

In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities. We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},

  abstract = {Social TV is a social media service via TV and social networks through which TV users exchange their experiences about TV programs that they are viewing. For social TV service, two technical aspects are envisioned: grouping of similar TV users to create social TV communities and recommending TV programs based on group and personal interests for personalizing TV. In this paper, we propose a unified topic model based on grouping of similar TV users and recommending TV programs as a social TV service. The proposed unified topic model employs two latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models. One is a topic model of TV users, and the other is a topic model of the description words for viewed TV programs. The two LDA models are then integrated via a topic proportion parameter for TV programs, which enforces the grouping of similar TV users and associated description words for watched TV programs at the same time in a unified topic modeling framework. The unified model identifies the semantic relation between TV user groups and TV program description word groups so that more meaningful TV program recommendations can be made. The unified topic model also overcomes an item ramp-up problem such that new TV programs can be reliably recommended to TV users. Furthermore, from the topic model of TV users, TV users with similar tastes can be grouped as topics, which can then be recommended as social TV communities. To verify our proposed method of unified topic-modeling-based TV user grouping and TV program recommendation for social TV services, in our experiments, we used real TV viewing history data and electronic program guide data from a seven-month period collected by a TV poll agency. The experimental results show that the proposed unified topic model yields an average 81.4% precision for 50 topics in TV program recommendation and its performance is an average of 6.5% higher than that of the topic model of TV users only. For TV user prediction with new TV programs, the average - rediction precision was 79.6%. Also, we showed the superiority of our proposed model in terms of both topic modeling performance and recommendation performance compared to two related topic models such as polylingual topic model and bilingual topic model.},

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to assess the learners' understandings. The mentioned method which is named TagAssessment computes the figure of relationship between the contents and the user's tags and utilizes the obtained results for learner assessment. In this regard, the semantic distance between the tags associated to the content, and the concepts covered by the same content is calculated using WordNet tree ontology. In the evaluation process, ninety learners were asked to place their tags on the contents related to a BSc course to create a data set for further evaluation. The obtained results showed that as the smaller the distance between the learners' tags and the contents are the better comprehension have been achieved.},

To deal with the problem, numerous approaches employed semantic techniques in terms of annotation (or tagging) and service discovery algorithms. However, the problem of semantic service discovery based on the identification of fine-grained goals of users and services is still challenging due to the lack of semantic information in Web services. To enable the goal-driven semantic service discovery, we propose an automatic functional-goals tagging approach which employs a set of natural language processing (NLP) procedures based on the descriptions of Web services. In addition, to check the effectiveness of the functional-goals tagged, we designed a goal-driven semantic service discovery algorithm and compared it with other approaches: keyword-based, ontology-based, and topic-based service discovery. As results, our proposed goal-driven semantic service discovery achieved 75.7% of precision and 59.6% of recall (finally, F1=62%) that outperform other discovery approaches.},

The manual screening of biomedical literature is an important task in the process of systematic reviews. Researchers and curators have the very demanding, time-consuming, and error-prone task of manually identifying documents that should be included in a systematic review concerning a specific problem. We developed a supervised learning approach to support screening tasks, by automatically flagging potentially relevant documents from a list retrieved by a literature database search. To overcome the main issues associated with the automatic literature screening task, we evaluated the use of data sampling, feature combinations, and feature selection methods, generating a total of 105 classification models. The models yielding the best results were composed of a Logistic Model Trees classifier, a fairly balanced training set, and feature combination of Bag-Of-Words and MeSH terms. According to our results, the system correctly labels the great majority of relevant documents, making it usable to support HIV systematic reviews to allow researchers to assess a greater number of documents in less time.},

  abstract  = {The first recorded crowdsourcing activity was in 1714 [1], with intermittent public event occurrences up until the millennium when such activities become widespread, spanning multiple domains. Crowdsourcing, however, is relatively novel as a methodology within virtual environment studies, in archaeology, and within the heritage domains where this research is focused. The studies that are being conducted are few and far between in comparison to other areas. This paper aims to develop a recent concept in crowdsourcing work termed `crowd behaviour mining' [2] using virtual environments, and to develop a unique concept in crowdsourcing activities that can be applied beyond the case studies presented here and to other domains that involve human behaviour as independent variables. The case studies described here use data from experiments involving separate heritage projects and conducted during two Royal Society Summer Science Exhibitions, in 2012 and 2015 respectively. `Crowd Behaviour Mining' analysis demonstrated a capacity to inform research in respect of potential patterns and trends across space and time as well as preferences between demographic user groups and the influence of experimenters during the experiments.},

Under the considered setting, the task is for all the nodes, after receiving any new chunk of training data, to agree on a single classifier in a decentralized fashion, without reliance on a master node. In particular, in this paper we propose a fully decentralized, sequential learning algorithm for a class of neural networks known as Random Vector Functional-Link nets. The proposed algorithm does not require the presence of a single coordinating agent, and it is formulated exclusively in term of local exchanges between neighboring nodes, thus making it useful in a wide range of realistic situations. Experimental simulations on four music classification benchmarks show that the algorithm has comparable performance with respect to a centralized solution, where a single agent collects all the local data from every node and subsequently updates the model.},

This indicates that participants should be subjected to more “high-pressure” conditions in future trials.

Can these biases be used to improve existing automated image tagging systems? We show that tag ordering, which has been largely overlooked by the image tagging community, is an important cue in understanding user tagging behavior and can be used to improve auto-tagging systems. Inspired by the assumption that people order their tags, we propose a new way of measuring tag preferences, and also propose a new personalized tagging objective function that explicitly considers a user's preferred tag orderings. We also provide a (partially) greedy algorithm that produces good solutions to our new objective and under certain conditions produces an optimal solution. We validate our method on a subset of Flickr images that spans 5000 users, over 5200 tags, and over 90,000 images. Our experiments show that exploiting personalized tag orders improves the average performance of state-of-art approaches both on per-image and per-user bases.},

  abstract  = {eGovernment in the new context of smart cities aims at improving the participation model of citizens that are no longer mere consumers of services designed and offered by public bodies. The availability of (open) data from the PA and third party organizations, which can be made public and widely accessible, introduces a significant paradigm shift from citizen-centric to citizen-driven eGovernment. In this direction, the mashup model (for client-side composition), with the ability to use widespread and relatively simple Web technologies, seems to be a viable approach for simplifying service creation. To ensure an adequate penetration of this new way of service offering, social-aware service discovery techniques assume a crucial role. In the paper, we propose a recommender that offers, in addition to the conventional search techniques, some support for context- aware implicit search of services, based on social information. The ability to leverage the data characterizing the activity of users in the network easies service selection: social relationships and the potential behavioral similarities between people, or in general among users linked by similar interests, enable the inference of further behavior details when they are not directly retrievable from static or even dynamic user profiles.},

These six use cases demonstrate the difficulty to select the appropriate model elements and properties according to the IoT application context as well as to identify proper metrics for measuring UX. However, based on the six use cases experiments, a bottom-up (grounded) UX model applicable to any IoT use case appears to emerge from the empirical results. The experiments conducted within the use cases show the interest of the iterative nature of the Living Lab experiential design process for improving the design until it reaches the highest level of user satisfaction inducing an appropriate technology adoption rate by consumers.

Transfer learning tackles it from a different way: borrow labeled examples from a different but related domain (source domain) by assigning weights to those examples based on their suitability on the new domain (target domain). However, it is quite challenging to figure out the suitability. In this paper, we propose a different way for utilizing the labeled examples from source domain. That is, we use them only for labelling the unlabelled examples in the target domain. In this self-labelling, we use the idea of Tri-training. We call our new algorithm: TriTransfer. In TriTransfer, three initial classifiers are generated from the source data and the originally labeled data in the target domain, and an unlabeled example is labeled and added to the labeled data for a classifier if other two classifiers agree on its label. After an expanded labeled data set is obtained, we re-train the classifier. We repeat this process until no more change can be made. At the end, the final classifier, which is a weighted combination of the three classifiers, is output. We conduct an extensive empirical study on 34 UCI datasets, which shows that TriTransfer performs better than the state-of-art algorithms Transfer Boost, Tritraining, and NaiveBayes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a cross-modal approach for extracting semantic relationships between concepts using tagged images. In the proposed method, we first project both text and visual features of the tagged images to a latent space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Then, under the probabilistic interpretation of CCA, we calculate a representative distribution of the latent variables for each concept. Based on the representative distributions of the concepts, we derive two types of measures: the semantic relatedness between the concepts and the abstraction level of each concept. Because these measures are derived from a cross-modal scheme that enables the collaborative use of both text and visual features, the semantic relationships can successfully reflect semantic and visual contexts. Experiments conducted on tagged images collected from Flickr show that our measures are more coherent to human cognition than the conventional measures that use either text or visual features, or the WordNet-based measures. In particular, a new measure of semantic relatedness, which satisfies the triangle inequality, obtains the best results among different distance measures in our framework. The applicability of our measures to multimedia-related tasks such as concept clustering, image annotation and tag recommendation is also shown in the experiments.},

The results generated by the current algorithms often ignore diversity in the recommended results, which seriously affecting the user's experience. In this paper, we address the problem of diversified coverage based tag recommendation. To our best knowledge, it is first proposed in the context of tag recommendation. Since the NP-hardness of the problem, a greedy based diversified coverage tag recommendation algorithm, namely GDC, is proposed. First, it constructs a semantic similarity graph based on the local and global tag co-occurrence matrices, which improves the recommendation accuracy by incorporating both the user's interests and the popularity of tags. Further, GDC recursively searches the MIDS (Minimum Independent Dominating Set) in an efficient manner together with an effective pruning rule. The experiments conducted on the real datasets of MovieLens and Last.fm show that the proposed GDC improve the diversity significantly.},

To evaluate CLANdroid we created a benchmark consisting of 14,450 apps along with information on similar apps provided by Google Play. We also compared effectiveness of different semantic anchors for detecting similar apps as perceived by 27 users. The results show that using Android-specific semantic anchors are useful for detecting similar Android apps across different categories. We also measured the impact of third-party libraries and obfuscated code when identifying similar Android apps, and our results suggest that there is significant difference in the accuracy when third-party libraries are excluded.},

Judging the users expertise in such collaborative systems is an important issue. As these systems are becoming increasingly popular, they are attackable, e.g. by Sybil Attacks. Thus, an effective expert ranking strategy must be robust to such attacks. In this paper, we propose MHITS, an algorithm to rank users' expertise by exploiting the number of users' fair ratings and direct trust users gain in the online community. We integrate SumUp, a Sybil-resilient algorithm, into MHITS algorithm as a robust ranking strategy. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can ensure that the highly ranked experts are highly trusted users and provide the high number of fair ratings for the relevant media. We contribute to the experimental evaluation of algorithms for online systems, fighting malicious behavior.},

By aggregation, we mean identifying, collecting, and curating the top performing syndicated sources in a discourse domain. Buzz, or urgent conversation about a topic or issue, once identified, can be used by communicators to raise the performance of their own social media messaging. Trends, once discovered, can be used to inform the decision-making processes of marketers, planners, or communicators.

This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36% using the proposed algorithm.},

Moreover, there is a lack of mechanisms for automatically eliciting and updating such personal characteristics within Learning Object Repositories (LOR) in order to exploit them for enhanced LO recommendations. Towards tackling this issue, this paper proposes a teacher ICT Competence elicitation mechanism utilizing fuzzy logic for inferring teachers' ICT Competences based on their usage patterns within LOR and presents the results of its preliminary accuracy evaluation.

Since large amounts of documents and code in GitHub repositories are in a mess, users cannot search or understand them efficiently. One solution is to employ a tag system, which annotates each repository with several tags. Thus, the GitHub repositories can be more efficiently accessed and understood. However, GitHub does not provide any automated tools of tagging repositories. In order to tackle this problem, we propose GRETA, a novel graph-based approach to assigning tags for repositories on GitHub. The core insight of GRETA is (1) to construct an Entity-Tag Graph (ETG) for GitHub using the domain knowledge from StackOverflow, and (2) to assign tags for repositories by taking a random walk algorithm. We have implemented GRETA and also developed a repository search engine for GitHub using the tag assignment results of GRETA. We have evaluated GRETA against several baseline methods to investigate its effectiveness of tagging GitHub repositories. The results show GRETA achieves up to 35% of F-Measure, outperforming the baseline methods. Besides, the GRETA-based search engine gains a higher NDCG value than the search engine provided by GitHub, indicating that it significantly enhances the search ability on GitHub with the tagged repositories.},

Attackers usually leverage the popumobile smart phoneslarity of Android apps by inserting malwares, modifying the original apps, repackaging and releasing them for their own illegal purposes. To avoid repackaged apps from being detected, they usually use sorts of obfuscation and encryption tools. As a result, it's important to detect which apps are repackaged. People often intuitively judge whether two apps are a repackaged pair by executing them and observing their runtime user interface (UI) traces. Hence, we propose layout group graph (LGG) built from UI trances to model those UI behaviors and use LGG as the birthmark of Android apps for identification. Based on LGG, we also implement a dynamic repackaging detection tool, RepDroid. Since our method does not require the apps' source code, it is resilient to app obfuscation and encryption. We conducted an experiment with two data sets. The first set contains 98 pairs of repackaged apps. The original apps and repackaged ones are compared and we can detect all of these repackaged pairs. The second set contains 125 commercial apps. We compared them pair-wisely and the false positive rate was 0.08%.},

  abstract  = {Associating image content with their geographic locations has been increasingly pursued in the computer vision community in recent years. In a recent work, large collections of geotagged images were found to be helpful in estimating geo-locations of query images by simple visual nearest-neighbors search. In this paper, we leverage user tags along with image content to infer the geo-location. Our model builds upon the fact that the visual content and user tags of pictures can provide significant hints about their geo-locations. Using a large collection of over a million geotagged photographs, we build location probability maps of user tags over the entire globe. These maps reflect the picture-taking and tagging behaviors of thousands of users from all over the world, and reveal interesting tag map patterns. Visual content matching is performed using multiple feature descriptors including tiny images, color histograms, GIST features, and bags of textons. The combination of visual content matching and local tag probability maps forms a strong geo-inference engine. Large-scale experiments have shown significant improvements over pure visual content-based geo-location inference.},

However, most of the existing approaches focus on the learners' perspective and do not take into consideration teachers' profile. Moreover, the systems that do target teachers, do not explicitly exploit their ICT competence profiles. This can lead to recommending LOs that are beyond the teachers' current ability to use in their teaching practice. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem and propose, as a first step, a set of mapping rules for aligning teachers' ICT competences and LO metadata elements. Moreover, a preliminary simulated evaluation is described, the results of which indicate that the mapping schema can provide robust identification of appropriate LOs based on both the users' ICT competences and the overall ratings of the educational resources.},

  abstract = {Most explanations of the user behavior while interacting with the web are based on a top-down approach, where the entire Web, viewed as a vast collection of pages and interconnection links, is used to predict how the users interact with it. A prominent example of this approach is the random-surfer model, the core ingredient behind Google's PageRank. This model exploits the linking structure of the Web to estimate the percentage of web surfers viewing any given page. Contrary to the top-down approach, a bottom-up approach starts from the user and incrementally builds the dynamics of the web as the result of the users' interaction with it. The second approach has not being widely investigated, although there are numerous advantages over the top-down approach regarding (at least) personalization and decentralization of the required infrastructure for web tools. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach to study the web dynamics based on web-related data browsed, collected, tagged, and semi-organized by end users. Our approach has been materialized into a hybrid bottom-up search engine that produces search results based solely on user provided web-related data and their sharing among users. We conduct an extensive experimental study to demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of user generated web-related data, their strength, and weaknesses as well as to compare the search results of our bottom-up search engine with those of a traditional one. Our study shows that a bottom-up search engine starts from a core consisting of the most interesting part of the Web (according to user opinions) and incrementally (and measurably) improves its ranking, coverage, and accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be integrated with PageRank, resulting in a new page ranking algorithm that can uniquely combine link analysis with users' preferences.},

The rarity score is a product of a relevancy score and an a typicality score. The relevancy is a probability that a Web page belongs to a category given by a user. The a typicality is a conditional probability that a page is atypical in the category when it belongs to the category. Both probabilities are calculated by using tags of social bookmark services and words in Web pages. We evaluated the proposed relevancy score by classifying whether Web pages belong to a certain category. We also evaluated the proposed rarity as a metric for ranking Web pages, and compared the rankings by relevancy and a typicality. We confirmed usefulness of the rarity score to find relevant and atypical pages.},

To provide information for the relevance judgment, we propose a novel method for generating personalized snippets for web page recommender systems. Our method directly uses the reasons the web pages are recommended to the user. This use of reasons enables snippets to be selected that better reflect the interest of the user. Moreover, our method can work with various web page recommender systems. It also leverages the maximum coverage summarization model to generate personalized snippets. The results of an experiment on a manually created dataset show that our method is more effective than a personalized summarization model.},

The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be "implicit". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented). The paper discusses these issues in detail and provides an overview of pioneering efforts in the field.},

Contributing towards this goal, this paper responds with a proposal to facilitate collaborative requirements management, which supports the four classical processes of requirements management: elicitation, analysis, specification and validation. The elicitation and analysis of requirements is made with the support of wiki-based front-ends and then, the requirements are specified and handled in an ontology, thus enabling advanced reasoning capabilities able to support the requirements validation and enterprises' resources management (e.g. Prioritize solutions) during the course of products and services development lifecycle.},

With such information, much richer queries can be issued and novel interfaces can be built through which the results of such queries can be explored more intuitively. We make the case for social-technical code search, introduce six categories of social-technical information and how it would enhance search, and briefly introduce CodeExchange, our prototype platform we are developing to explore social-technical code search.},

In the proposed architecture, word embeddings are rst trained on API documents, tutorials, and reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously explored bug localization task and a newly de ned task of linking API documents to computer programming questions.},

To facilitate common labeling and comparison across data collections and laboratories, an individual's annotation can be collected in a common community database to encourage annotation reuse.

  abstract  = {GitHub contains millions of repositories among which many are similar with one another (i.e., having similar source codes or implementing similar functionalities). Finding similar repositories on GitHub can be helpful for software engineers as it can help them reuse source code, build prototypes, identify alternative implementations, explore related projects, find projects to contribute to, and discover code theft and plagiarism. Previous studies have proposed techniques to detect similar applications by analyzing API usage patterns and software tags. However, these prior studies either only make use of a limited source of information or use information not available for projects on GitHub. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can effectively detect similar repositories on GitHub. Our approach is designed based on three heuristics leveraging two data sources (i.e., GitHub stars and readme files) which are not considered in previous works. The three heuristics are: repositories whose readme files contain similar contents are likely to be similar with one another, repositories starred by users of similar interests are likely to be similar, and repositories starred together within a short period of time by the same user are likely to be similar. Based on these three heuristics, we compute three relevance scores (i.e., readme-based relevance, stargazer-based relevance, and time-based relevance) to assess the similarity between two repositories. By integrating the three relevance scores, we build a recommendation system called RepoPal to detect similar repositories. We compare RepoPal to a prior state-of-the-art approach CLAN using one thousand Java repositories on GitHub. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RepoPal achieves a higher success rate, precision and confidence over CLAN.},

The technique demonstrates a number of advantages over alternative methods for displaying and exploring geo-referenced search results and spatio-temporal data. Firstly, cluster summaries can be presented in a manner that makes them easy to read and scan. Listing representative events from each cluster also helps the process of discovery by preserving the diversity of results. Also, clicking on visual representations of geo-temporal clusters provides a quick and intuitive way to navigate across space and time simultaneously. This removes the need to overload users with the display of too many event labels at any one time.

  abstract  = {As larger and larger amounts of data are harvested, finding just the right piece of information out of this noisy and heterogeneous ocean of data remains challenging. Many widely adopted scientific data search engines continue to be mainly based on text semantics. However, it is not uncommon in scientific big data applications to face collected data that do not possess text information. In this scenario, search engines fail to retrieve potentially relevant data. For instance, even though Pangaea, a digital data library and a publisher for earth system science, contains more than 400,000 datasets, more than 98% lack sufficient text information. In this work, we propose a novel pseudo relevance feedback method based on spatio-temporal and text (STT) information for scientific big data: STT-PRF. Although STT-PRF may simultaneously use STT information, we show that the missing values in space, time or/and the text are handled efficiently. STT-PRF is especially robust even without text information. We tested our STT-PRF method using the Pangaea repository on our Cross-DB Search Platform, which is a search engine for scientific big data based on various latent correlations. Experimental evaluations on such standard metrics as nDCG and Precision/Recall show that STT-PRF outperforms the standard baseline methods.},

Following this methodology, a huge quantity of data is being published on the Web of Data, but very little is currently consumed by educational applications. This paper proposes to overcome this situation by relating educational vocabularies to the ones already used on the Web of Data. This way, educational applications can take advantage of the data published on the Web even if such data was not published for educational purposes. As a case study, the vocabulary used by an educational tool search system, called Ontoolsearch, is related to ICT tool descriptions published by DBpedia and Factforge. Evaluation results show that 2905 tool descriptions can be retrieved from the Web of Data to be consumed by Ontoolsearch. In addition, most of these descriptions have a similar quality to the ones manually published by an educational tool expert.},

  abstract = {One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.},

This process can be modelled as a social network, also known as co-tagging network, where the actors are the taggers and the relationships between them are the common tags that they have used. Co-tagging networks have been studied by applying social network analysis (SNA) metrics so as to: (a) draw significant insights about the influence of central users to the (tagging) behaviour of other users and (b) identify clusters of taggers based on the content of the tags that they use. Nevertheless, there are no previous works, which have studied co-tagging networks in the field of Learning Object Repositories (LORs).

The process extracts features from the image data that the users are interested in to mitigate a problem, which is regarded as an undulated analysis, and then recom-mends an automotive design by combining the image filtering and collaborative filtering that use the static relationship between the users' preference and the image color information.

A system developed using the proposed models is adaptive (adapts the recommended tags to the existing set of tags), has a feedback (after each tagging, the set of tags and the dictionary are updated), is personalized (each user develops its own set of tags), and is semantics-aware (uses an ontology to refine tags). The models are validated using five sets of texts with different topics (technology, cooking, carrier, scientific, nature) and different length.},

Novel artists whose popularity is on the rise have a higher priority to be recommended. Specifically, given a user's favorite artists, the system first determines the candidate artists based on their similarity with the favorite artists and then selects those who have a higher novelty score than the favorite artists. Then, the system outputs a playlist composed of the most popular songs of the selected artists. The proposed system can be integrated into most existing systems. Its performance is evaluated using the Spotify Radio Recommender as a reference and a pool of 100 subjects recruited on campus. Experimental results show that our system achieves a high novelty score and a competitive user-preference score.},

Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.},

In this paper, we present a novel incremental and scalable web-supervised learning system that continuously learns appearance models for image categories with heterogeneous appearances and improves these models periodically. Simply specifying the name of the concept that has to be learned initializes the proposed system, and there is no further supervision afterwards. Textual and visual information on web sites are used to filter out irrelevant and misleading training images. To obtain a robust, flexible, and updatable way of learning, a novel learning framework is presented that relies on clustering in order to identify visual subclasses before using an ensemble of random forests, called random savanna, for subclass learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed web-supervised learning approach outperforms a support vector machine (SVM), while at the same time being simply parallelizable in the training and testing phases.},

On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones. In the experiments, the developed recommender system is tested on two different data sets; and the experiment results indicate that this system is more effective than CoFiDS, a typical recommender system offering soft ratings.},

These systems achieved widespread success on the Web on account of the simplicity for organizing resources using open-ended tags. Recently, tag recommendation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problems of ambiguity, syntactic variations and noise in tags cause by the inherent characteristics of natural language. In this work we proposed a content-based approach that generates a list of suggested tags for annotating a given resource starting from an analysis of its textual content exclusively. Thus, the proposed method can be used in situations in which there is not enough information for creating a tag-based user profile or compare the user with others. For extracting the more relevant words different term weighting approaches were evaluated, particularly considering the HTML structure of Web pages and the grammatical category of words in order to determine promising tag candidates. Experimental results of applying this technique to tag recommendation using several term weighting approaches are reported and compared.},

In this paper, we firstly define the diversity of a user's social circle, which means the dispersion extent of the user's friend distribution in the network. A method for measuring diversity and broadness of a user's social circle in network is also presented. Preliminary experiment demonstrates that user's social circle does matter in information diffusion. Moreover, a social circle weighted PageRank algorithm which takes both popularity (in-degree) and social circle broadness into account is proposed.

To solve the sparsity problem, we first introduce a new graph learning (GL) method for enriching the tagging data according to item similarities. Then, we develop a method of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for learning more coherent ternary relations among users, images and tags coupled by the manifold constraints learned from item co-occurrences.

  abstract = {The web is perceived as a new social platform. Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.},

  abstract  = {Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media. Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (e.g., breaking events) and stable topics (e.g., user interests). Due to their different natures, it is important and useful to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However, such a discrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are very short in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporal topics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically, a unified user-temporal mixture model is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model's performance, we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information in a social network, as well as a burst-weighted smoothing scheme that exploits temporal prior information in the time dimension. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposal on two real data sets obtained from Del.icio.us and Twitter. The experimental results verify that our mixture model is able to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in a single detection process. Our mixture model enhanced with the spatial regularization and the burst-weighted smoothing scheme significantly outperforms competitor approaches, in terms of topic detection accuracy and discrimination in stable and temporal topics.},

However, in some applications, labeled data are either costly to collect or easily outdated, resulting in poor generalization of trained machine learners. Nonetheless, there are often related domains where large corpuses of labeled data can be easily obtained. Therefore, we propose a new transfer learning algorithm to adapt a neural network trained on such a related domain to the target domain by grafting additional nodes onto its hidden layer. This neural grafting method is capable of transfering the knowledge embedded in the structures of the trained neural network to the problem in the target domain. Experiments on synthesized and real data sets show that grafted networks achieve good performance with very small amounts of data from the target domain. Compared with existing transfer learning techniques, the proposed neural grafting is easy to tune and computationally simple, with superior performance.},

  abstract  = {Autonomic and autonomous systems exist within a world view of their own. This world view is created from the training data and assumptions that were available at their inception. In most of these systems this world view becomes obsolete over time due to changes in the environment. This brings a level of inaccuracy in the autonomic behavior of the system. When this degradation reaches a certain threshold self-healing or self-optimizing systems generally recreate the world view using current data and assumptions. However, the self-optimization process is akin to kill a fly with a hammer for minor tuning of the world view. Instead we propose the idea of self-calibration for self-managing these systems. We define self-calibration as the ability of the system to perceive the need for and the ability to execute minimal tuning to bridge the gap between system's world view and incoming information about the outside world. In this paper we present a case for considering self-calibration as a self-* enabling property of systems specifically for time-critical systems using data-centric AI technologies. We present our case by discussing three case studies from different domains where self-calibration enables a system to become self-healing or self-optimizing. We then place self-calibration in a generic system and explicitly describe the types of systems in which self-calibration can be implemented and the benefits that one can accrue from its inclusion.},

Matching is done on clusters on the description generated within WSDL file to get the desired service.

Our proposal to reverse this situation is a model to infer users' social contexts by the application of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining techniques over users' interaction data on Facebook. We take advantage of both Facebook and Groupon APIs to provide a deployment scenario in which knowing users' social life allows ads to target the most potential customers, which is beneficial for both companies and possible customers.},

Since the magnitudes of users and commodities in E-commerce system has increased dramatically, the user rating data in the entire item space become extremely sparse. There is a certain deviation while using traditional similarity measure methods, which reduces the recommendation accuracy for the recommendation systems. To overcome the shortages of the traditional similarity measures under such conditions, this paper proposes using similarity impact factor to improve similarity measures in collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. The experimental results show that the factor can effectively improve the similarity measure result while user rating data are extremely sparse, and significantly improve the accuracy of the recommendation systems.},

In this paper, an improved recommendation algorithm with considering users' habits and rating behaviors will be proposed. Firstly, calculate the ratings entropy for each user via users' rating records which can reflect users' behavioral features. Secondly, widely-used user-based method will be improved by considering rating entropy. Finally, the predicting rate is generated. Experimental results on the three datasets: Movie Lens, Netflix and RYM all suggest that the proposed method can enhance the algorithmic accuracy. Furthermore, since this method can improve those missing value more accurately via users' similarity and rating behaviors which might shed some light on discovering users' purchasing intention and optimizing the performance of recommender systems by human dynamics.},

In order to derive an effective domain adaptation, a good feature representation across domains is crucial as well as the generalisation ability of the predictive model. In this paper we address the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classification by combining deep learning, for acquiring a cross-domain high-level feature representation, and ensemble methods, for reducing the cross-domain generalization error. The proposed adaptation framework has been evaluated on a benchmark dataset composed of reviews of four different Amazon category of products, significantly outperforming the state of the art methods.},

In this paper, we consider one such platform that was developed for the internal use in a large global enterprise. We present data and their analysis for how this social media platform has been used in HP over the past five years. We then present conclusions from this analysis and relate them to work patterns in enterprises with the goal to better adapt social media platforms to the enterprise domain such that they better integrate with the work context people have as well as with IT systems that are used by them. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we present data and usage analysis of our social media platform over the past five years. Second, based on this analysis, we derive enhancements for social media platforms to better fit the work context and that can turn social media into a new generation of productivity platforms for the enterprise.},

Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

The collection of user reviews would generate a positive or negative influence to the media audience. Some malicious users may create multiple variant accounts on the same social media so as to influence or manipulate public opinions for business or criminal purposes. To maintain good social environment, it is necessary to find those fake users. In this paper, we investigate the user variants identification problem using both user behavior and item related information. We study the characteristics of user behaviors on social media and introduce two concepts visibility and distingushibility to preliminarily quantify whether a fake user can be identified. To better understand user intention and characteristics, we profile a user with apparent and implicit features, which are extracted from three aspects: User Generated Contents (UGC), user behavior context and item information. Based on these features, we propose the user Variants Identification Problem (VIP) and an identification algorithm, which finds the top-k similar variants in a social media. We evaluate our methods against two real datasets MovieLens and Amazon and make comparison on the effectiveness against different features in identifying user variants.},

In this context, one of our contributions [1] proposes an algorithm enabling to compute user's interests using information from egocentric network extracted communities. Therefore, mining information from a small or a sparse network remains challenging because there is not enough information to enrich a relevant user's profile. So, one of the main lock is to cope with the lack of information that is considered as an important issue to extract a relevant community and could lead to misinterpretations in the user's profile modeling process. We aim to improve the performance of [1], regarding the lack of information problem, in the case of a small and/or a sparse network. We propose to add more information (i.e. relations) into user's network before extracting the data and enriching his profile. To achieve this enrichment, we suggest using snowball sampling technique to identify and add user's distance-2 neighbors (friends of a friend) into the user's egocentric network. Our experimentation conducted in DBLP demonstrates the interest of node integration into small and sparse network. This leads to the study of link prediction that enables us to provide better performances and results compared to the existing work.},

In this approach, much of the manual work on annotation is replaced with a semi-automatic process based on prior gathering of domain expertise. The geometric properties of objects and their spatial relationships are first automatically extracted and associated with a general ontology, the result of which is then matched against a set of user-defined rules to create annotations represented in an application ontology. The approach is Web3D oriented so that it can take advantage of features of X3D format. It will be shown using a prototype system how this approach can succeed in accelerating the annotation process.},

In particular, the possibility of understanding which perceptual elements allow a human recognizing the event depicted by an image would open new directions in event media discovery. In this paper we introduce the concept of event saliency to define the above event-revealing perceptual elements, and we propose an original method to detect it by exploiting crowd knowledge through gamification. We propose an adversarial game with a hidden purpose, where users are engaged in competitive roles: masking photos to prevent competitors recognizing the related event, and discovering events in photos masked by other players. Rules and incentives are defined to minimize cheating and force players to focus on details that really matter. A suitable algorithm composes the masks created by different players on the same media, thus producing a saliency map that, different from the traditional concept of saliency, does not focus on perceptual prominence but rather on event-related semantics of media. A thorough validation on public datasets is presented, and initial experiments to apply event saliency in detection tasks are proposed . Furthermore, an event-saliency dataset is disclosed to allow further research.},

Our method focuses on (i) converting a text document into a thematic graph of entities occurring in the document, (ii) ontological classification of the entities in the graph, and (iii) determining the overall categorization of the thematic graph, and as a result, the document itself.

There are a large number of campaigns containing coordinated spam or promoting accounts in Twitter, which are more harmful than the traditional methods, such as email spamming. Since traditional solutions mainly check individual accounts or messages, it is an urgent task to detect spam and promoting campaigns in Twitter. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework to detect both spam and promoting campaigns. Our framework consists of three steps: firstly linking accounts who post URLs for similar purposes, secondly extracting candidate campaigns which may exist for spam or promoting purpose and finally distinguishing their intents. One salient aspect of the framework is introducing a URL-driven estimation method to measure the similarity between accounts' purposes of posting URLs, the other one is proposing multiple features to distinguish the candidate campaigns based on a machine learning method. Over a large-scale dataset from Twitter, we can extract the actual campaigns with high precision and recall and distinguish the majority of the candidate campaigns correctly.},

However, the huge amount of data available, along with the breadth of the user base, requires a substantial effort of information filtering to successfully drill down to relevant topics and events. Trending topic detection is therefore a fundamental building block to monitor and summarize information originating from social sources. There are a wide variety of methods and variables and they greatly affect the quality of results. We compare six topic detection methods on three Twitter datasets related to major events, which differ in their time scale and topic churn rate. We observe how the nature of the event considered, the volume of activity over time, the sampling procedure and the pre-processing of the data all greatly affect the quality of detected topics, which also depends on the type of detection method used. We find that standard natural language processing techniques can perform well for social streams on very focused topics, but novel techniques designed to mine the temporal distribution of concepts are needed to handle more heterogeneous streams containing multiple stories evolving in parallel. One of the novel topic detection methods we propose, based on -grams cooccurrence and topic ranking, consistently achieves the best performance across all these conditions, thus being more reliable than other state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract  = {This book outlines the basic principles of creation and maintenance of taxonomies and thesauri. It also provides step by step instructions for building a taxonomy or thesaurus and discusses the various ways to get started on a taxonomy construction project. Often, the first step is to get management and budgetary approval, so I start this book with a discussion of reasons to embark on the taxonomy journey. From there I move on to a discussion of metadata and how taxonomies and metadata are related, and then consider how, where, and why taxonomies are used. Information architecture has its cornerstone in taxonomies and metadata. While a good discussion of information architecture is beyond the scope of this work, I do provide a brief discussion of the interrelationships among taxonomies, metadata, and information architecture. Moving on to the central focus of this book, I introduce the basics of taxonomies, including a definition of vocabulary control and why it is so important, how i dexing and tagging relate to taxonomies, a few of the types of tagging, and a definition and discussion of post- and pre-coordinate indexing. After that I present the concept of a hierarchical structure for vocabularies and discuss the differences among various kinds of controlled vocabularies, such as taxonomies, thesauri, authority files, and ontologies. Once you have a green light for your project, what is the next step? Here I present a few options for the first phase of taxonomy construction and then a more detailed discussion of metadata and markup languages. I believe that it is important to understand the markup languages (SGML and XML specifically, and HTML to a lesser extent) in relation to information structure, and how taxonomies and metadata feed into that structure. After that, I present the steps required to build a taxonomy, from defining the focus, collecting and organizing terms, analyzing your vocabulary for even coverage over subject areas, filling in gaps, creatin relationships between terms, and applying those terms to your content. Here I offer a cautionary note: don’t believe that your taxonomy is “done!” Regular, scheduled maintenance is an important—critical, really—component of taxonomy construction projects. After you’ve worked through the steps in this book, you will be ready to move on to integrating your taxonomy into the workflow of your organization. This is covered in Book 3 of this series.

Moreover, rather than pursuing rule-based methods as in literature, we employ a machine learning model to not only disambiguate but also identify named entities. In addition, our method explores in details the use of a range of features extracted from texts, a given ontology, and Wikipedia data for disambiguation. This paper also systematically analyzes impacts of the features on disambiguation accuracy by varying their combinations for representing named entities. Empirical evaluation shows that, while the ontology provides basic features of named entities, Wikipedia is a fertile source for additional features to construct accurate and robust named entity disambiguation systems.},

We then classify the applications of ontology based privacy protection into five types and conduct a comparison analysis on the respective ontologies for the five types of applications. At last, we explicitly analyze the ontologies in terms of their relationships to privacy protection and point out some shortcomings in the current research as well as some future research directions.},

Most conventional methods incorporate either a user profile or the item description, which cannot well utilize this kind of content information. Some other works jointly consider user ratings and reviews, but they are based on the factorization technique and have difficulty in providing explanations on generated recommendations. In this study, a coupled topic model (CoTM) for recommendation with UGC is developed. By combining UGC and ratings, the method discussed in this study captures both the content-based preferences and collaborative preferences and, thus, can explain both the user and item latent spaces using the topics discovered from the UGC. The learned topics in CoTM can also serve as proper explanations for the generated recommendations. Experimental results show that the proposed CoTM model yields significant improvements over the compared competitive methods on two typical datasets, that is, MovieLens-10M and Citation-network V1. The topics discovered by CoTM can be used not only to illustrate the topic distributions of users and items, but also to explain the generated user-item recommendations.},

The management and dissemination of news are not only faced with opportunities, but also faced many challenges. How to push the news and customized content to users timely and dynamically, so as to save the searching time, becomes a hot area of current research. A news correlation approach based on tags is proposed to provide users with a personalized news service. The system takes advantage of the network information crawling, web-based text mining and personalized recommendations technologies to realize automated extraction of news tag. The innovation of this mode is that the tag contains both categories and keywords. It contains a classification subject to the advantage of clustering, but also includes the theme of keywords intuitive expression. In other words, it matches the user's search habits.

For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions.

These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities.

  abstract  = {Reporting bugs, asking for new features and in general giving any kind of feedback is a common way to contribute to an Open-Source Software (OSS) project. This feedback is generally reported in the form of new issues for the project, managed by the so-called issue-trackers. One of the features provided by most issue-trackers is the possibility to define a set of labels/tags to classify the issues and, at least in theory, facilitate their management. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to confirm that taking the time to categorize new issues has indeed a beneficial impact on the project evolution. In this paper we analyze a population of more than three million of GitHub projects and give some insights on how labels are used in them. Our preliminary results reveal that, even if the label mechanism is scarcely used, using labels favors the resolution of issues. Our analysis also suggests that not all projects use labels in the same way (e.g., for some labels are only a way to prioritize the project while others use them to signal their temporal evolution as they move along in the development workflow). Further research is needed to precisely characterize these label “families” and learn more the ideal application scenarios for each of them.},

It has also become an important instrument for online marketing. Today, the Web is everywhere, starting from computers and ending up with portable devices such as smart-phones and tablets. As more and more information is made available over the Internet, users are facing information overload making it harder for them to find information searched for at once. With every click users make on a website (portal), they leave behind pieces of information describing their preferences and intentions. Applying advanced methods, these events can be captured into web usage logs for further processing by means of web usage mining to tailor web information systems to its users' needs and guarantee their loyalty and satisfaction.},

Taking inspiration from nature, we model the memeplex in search as instructions that specify the coadapted meme complexes of individuals in their lifetime. In particular, this paper presents a study on the conceptual modeling of meme complexes or memeplexes for more effective problem solving in the context of modern stochastic optimization. The memeplex representation, credit assignment criteria for meme coadaptation, and the role of emergent memeplexes in the lifetime learning process of a memetic algorithm in search are presented. A coadapted memetic algorithm that takes the proposed conceptual modeling of memeplexes into actions to solve capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs) of diverse characteristics is then designed. Results showed that adaptive memeplexes provide a means of creating highly robust, self-configuring, and scalable algorithms, thus generating improved or competitive results when benchmarking against several existing adaptive or human-designed state-of-the-art memetic algorithms and metaheuristics, on a plethora of CVRP sets considered.},

We propose to use the implicit opinion of users to calculate relevance. The Implicit judgment of users is injected to the documents by calculating different kinds of weighting. These latter touch several criteria like as user's weight in the query's words, user's profile, user's interest, document's content and the document popularity. In this method, each user is an active element of the system, he searches documents and he makes treatments to provide relevant information to other users in the Network. This is similar as the peer-to-peer systems; unlike that, an element (user) have to manage automatically his data by creating a short view model of his most visited documents, and calculates his relative relevance about each one. The relative relevance is variable according each user, so the final relevance is calculated by the averaging of the elementary relevance of all users. Hence, the name of collaborative relevance.},

  abstract  = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with modern sensors and sensor-based devices, will significantly stimulate the development of context-aware applications. An effective means to extract higher-level contextual information from sensor data is distributed complex event processing (CEP), which facilitates the analysis of real-time data streams coming from heterogeneous and distributed sources. Considering that user context is inherently sensitive information, the preservation of privacy is critical once the processing of user context takes place over several (possibly malicious) devices, especially in collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a trust-based approach for the placement and execution of CEP operators in a distributed environment. We propose a trust management model based on communication interactions among the users. Furthermore, we incorporate trust recommendations using a cosine-based similarity check in order to overcome collusion and on-off attacks. We developed a smartphone-based distributed CEP system called TrustCEP to evaluate our approach for trust management. Based on the evaluation of TrustCEP, we observe that our approach induces a minimal increase in average battery consumption compared to privacy-negligent approaches.},

  abstract  = {Many automated software engineering approaches, including code search, bug report categorization, and duplicate bug report detection, measure similarities between two documents by analyzing natural language contents. Often different words are used to express the same meaning and thus measuring similarities using exact matching of words is insufficient. To solve this problem, past studies have shown the need to measure the similarities between pairs of words. To meet this need, the natural language processing community has built WordNet which is a manually constructed lexical database that records semantic relations among words and can be used to measure how similar two words are. However, WordNet is a general purpose resource, and often does not contain software-specific words. Also, the meanings of words in WordNet are often different than when they are used in software engineering context. Thus, there is a need for a software-specific WordNet-like resource that can measure similarities of words. In this work, we propose an automated approach that builds a software-specific WordNet like resource, named WordSimSEDB, by leveraging the textual contents of posts in StackOverflow. Our approach measures the similarity of words by computing the similarities of the weighted co-occurrences of these words with three types of words in the textual corpus. We have evaluated our approach on a set of software-specific words and compared our approach with an existing WordNet-based technique (WordNetres) to return top-k most similar words. Human judges are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two techniques. We find that WordNetres returns no result for 55 % of the queries. For the remaining queries, WordNetres returns significantly poorer results.},

The goal of Web search personalization is to retrievce the search results to a particular user depends on that user's preferences. These data allows the users not only to facilitate and share the data, but to afford information and improve media retrieval and management. One such examples is personalized image retrieval where user's explicit information is considered to produce exact images using re-ranking results. In this paper, the Tag-Annotation based approach by Re-ranking (TAD-RR) is proposed to generate personalized images. The basic assertion is to collect the images from the user and store it in a database with appropriate tag and annotation. Thereby, semantic search is developed to compare the query with dictionary to find out the relevant tag name. The images are then found from the database by applying TAD-RR procedures. Finally, page refreshing is handled at the time of image downloading. If a particular image is downloaded, the demand will be increased for that image in the server and the page gets reloaded based on the retrieved image annotation by ranking similarly. The experimental results show that the proposed approach accurately retrieves the personalized images.},

Moreover, most of the previous works assume that the labels provided by the human oracles are noise free, which may often be violated in reality. We present a collaborative computational model for active learning with multiple human oracles. It leads to not only an ensemble kernel machine that is robust to label noises, but also a principled label quality measure to online detect irresponsible labelers. Instead of running independent active learning processes for each individual human oracle, our model captures the inherent correlations among the labelers through shared data among them. Our simulation experiments and experiments with real crowd-sourced noisy labels demonstrated the efficacy of our model.},

The practice of tagging is done in a collective environment. Folksonomies are self constructed, based on co-occurrence of definitions, rather than a hierarchical structure of the data. The downside of this was that a few sites and applications are able to successfully exploit the sharing of bookmarks. The need for tools that are able to resolve the ambiguity of the definitions is becoming urgent as the need of simple instruments for their visualization, editing and exploitation in web applications still hinders their diffusion and wide adoption. An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces. To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called " Folksodriven" is used in this paper. While it is presented the Folks driven Structure Network (FSN) to resolve the ambiguity of definitions of folksonomy tags suggestions for the user.

In this paper, we propose DroidVisor, an Android tool that provides users with fine-grained and customizable application recommendations. Compared to the Google store recommendation function, DroidVisor does not only use the similarity to a preselected target application, but also considers other metrics such as popularity, security, and usability. More specifically, DroidVisor provides an interface for users to configure the weight of each metric and a recommendation algorithm that generates a list of recommended applications based on the combined scores. We evaluate our proposed criteria and the quality of recommendation through use case studies. Finally, we present our findings through a discussion of accuracy as well as possible ways to improve our recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming data.},

However, many tags applied arbitrarily by users can not really reflect the contents of web pages and lead to ineffectiveness in information retrieval. Moreover, there are still some important tasks about how to eliminate ambiguity more easily and recommend more interested web pages to users. To resolve the above problems, we propose a novel mechanism named SSTAG, and it can recommend a set of Super-tags to users for their choices based on keywords input. As various topics related to the keywords, the Super-tags are selected from different clusters of web pages related to the keywords. A user chooses a Super-tag, which means the user may have chosen an interested topic, and then some more detailed tags in the topic are recommended as Sub-tags. The relationship between Super-tag and Sub-tag is just like navigation and positioning. Likewise, the user can choose one Sub-tag and submit it with the Super-tag. By means of the user's choice, this system can capture users' preference and recommend a series of related web pages.

Cognitive heuristics are the mental models used in cognitive psychology to describe how human brains efficiently process the huge amount of information constantly coming from the environment around us. As personal mobile devices represent proxies in the cyber world of their human users, we investigate how the same cognitive heuristics can be used by mobile devices to become self-aware of the features of the physical environment around their users. Specifically, we assume that physical locations are described as a network of tags. We consider a self-organising opportunistic network environment, where devices exchange information when meeting directly. We propose algorithms based on cognitive heuristics through which users' nodes obtain tags either directly when coming in proximity of locations, or indirectly through other nodes they meet. We analyse the properties of the networks of tags resulting at individual nodes, as they emerge from this process, as a function of various cognitive parameters. We show that using cognitive heuristics leads, under the same resource constraints, to much more effective information diffusion with respect to other reference solutions. Interestingly, we find critical thresholds for key parameters that discriminate between information diffusion and information loss. Finally, we show that, despite resource constraints, the structure of the network of tags at individual nodes is remarkably close to the ideal that would be obtained with infinite resources.},

  abstract = {Users can enjoy personalized services provided by various context-aware applications that collect users' contexts through sensor-equipped smartphones. Meanwhile, serious privacy concerns arise due to the lack of privacy preservation mechanisms. Currently, most mechanisms apply passive defense policies in which the released contexts from a privacy preservation system are always real, leading to a great probability with which an adversary infers the hidden sensitive contexts about the users. In this paper, we apply a deception policy for privacy preservation and present a novel technique, FakeMask, in which fake contexts may be released to provably preserve users' privacy. The output sequence of contexts by FakeMask can be accessed by the untrusted context-aware applications or be used to answer queries from those applications. Since the output contexts may be different from the original contexts, an adversary has greater difficulty in inferring the real contexts. Therefore, FakeMask limits what adversaries can learn from the output sequence of contexts about the user being in sensitive contexts, even if the adversaries are powerful enough to have the knowledge about the system and the temporal correlations among the contexts. The essence of FakeMask is a privacy checking algorithm which decides whether to release a fake context for the current context of the user. We present a novel privacy checking algorithm and an efficient one to accelerate the privacy checking process. Extensive evaluation experiments on real smartphone context traces of users demonstrate the improved performance of FakeMask over other approaches.},

The rationale is that resources found and selected by peers are likely to be relevant since the learning community is centered around the same course and the same learning tasks and is relatively homogeneous (classmates generally having common learning backgrounds and completing the same curriculum). Edu3R also relies on social tagging, through which learners annotate resources with meaningful terms that reflect the educational context, provide a personalized classification and facilitate subsequent retrieval. Finally, Edu3R also integrates a collaborative filtering mechanism for recommending learning resources based on student similarity. The paper provides an overview of the system architecture, functionalities and pedagogical rationale, as well as a comparison with similar platforms.},

  abstract        = {The challenge to provide tag recommendations for collaborative tagging systems has attracted quite some attention of researchers lately. However, most research focused on the evaluation and development of appropriate methods rather than tackling the practical challenges of how to integrate recommendation methods into real tagging systems, record and evaluate their performance. In this paper we describe the tag recommendation framework we developed for our social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. With the intention to develop, test, and evaluate recommendation algorithms and supporting cooperation with researchers, we designed the framework to be easily extensible, open for a variety of methods, and usable independent from BibSonomy. Furthermore, this paper presents a first evaluation of two exemplarily deployed recommendation methods. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Information extraction relevant to the user queries is the challenging task in the ontology environment due to data varieties such as image, video, and text. The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label products in a collection using a free vocabulary. The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users. This experience showed that TagProfiles are easier to understand and modify by users, allowing them to discover new movies as they interact with their profiles.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user’s preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences.

In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, have grown in popularity over the Web on account of their simplicity to organize several types of content (e.g., Web pages, pictures, and video) using open-ended tags. The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems. Current recommendation approaches stemming from fields such as user modeling, collaborative filtering, content, and link-analysis are reviewed and discussed to provide a starting point for researchers in the field as well as explore future research lines. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract        = {Tagging (or bookmarking) online resources with representative keywords is one of the most popular and practical approaches for giving identity to the objects. Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD. CODer Entrepreneurs in the automatically formed communities can dynamically improve identity of the entrepreneurial objects related to their expertise or interests.},

Therefore, the ultimate goal is development of the intelligent tutoring system that provides learning materials considering the requirements and understanding capability of the specific learner. In our previous research, we implemented a tutoring system named Protus 2.1 (PROgramming TUtoring System) that is used for learning basic concepts of Java programming language. It directs the learner’s activities and recommends relevant actions during the learning process based on the personal profile of each learner. This paper presents the implementation of collaborative tagging technique for content recommendation in Protus 2.1.

Motivated by this finding, we design the swapping index and smart moving index on tagging quality. We also study the correlations in tag usage and propose the semantic measurement on tagging quality. The proposed methods are evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient than previous methods, which are appropriate for a large number of web resources.

  abstract      = {As an example of exploring human memory cue use in an ecologically valid context, we present ongoing work to examine the “memory cue hypothesis” in collaborative tagging. In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract        = {In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of user-generated data in collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy-based) systems due to the prevailing of Web 2.0 communities. To effectively assist users to find their desired resources, it is critical to understand user behaviors and preferences. Tag-based profile techniques, which model users and resources by a vector of relevant tags, are widely employed in folksonomy-based systems. This is mainly because that personalized search and recommendations can be facilitated by measuring relevance between user profiles and resource profiles. However, conventional measurements neglect the sentiment aspect of user-generated tags. In fact, tags can be very emotional and subjective, as users usually express their perceptions and feelings about the resources by tags. Therefore, it is necessary to take sentiment relevance into account into measurements. In this paper, we present a novel generic framework SenticRank to incorporate various sentiment information to various sentiment-based information for personalized search by user profiles and resource profiles. In this framework, content-based sentiment ranking and collaborative sentiment ranking methods are proposed to obtain sentiment-based personalized ranking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of integrating sentiment information to address the problem of the personalized tag-based search in collaborative tagging systems. Moreover, we compare the proposed sentiment-based personalized search with baselines in the experiments, the results of which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we study the influences by popular sentiment dictionaries, and SenticNet is the most prominent knowledge base to boost the performance of personalized search in folksonomy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

From parent’s perspective, the ideal scenario would be one in which they could dynamically decide about the suitability of any content. Since this desired scenario entails many practical problems, we propose an intermediate solution where parents delegate the decision of blocking any piece of TV content on a trustworthy set of parents. Our approach provides a collaborative parental control model based on two pillar: (1) a parenting social network where parents interact, freely give their opinion about TV content and tag this content (collaborative tagging); and (2) a model of trust relationship between parents. Regarding the deployment of parental control, we introduce a parental monitoring system for DVB-IPTV content, which is based on social technologies. The proposal combines information from the service provider and from parents in a social network to predict whether content should be blocked. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced.

There is, however, little behavioral evidence that tags actually serve this purpose. Using a large-scale dataset from the social music website Last.fm, we explore how patterns of music tagging and subsequent listening interact to determine if there exist measurable signals of tags functioning as retrieval aids. Specifically, we describe our methods for testing if the assignment of a tag tends to lead to an increase in listening behavior. Results suggest that tagging, on average, leads to only very small increases in listening rates, and overall the data do not support the assumption that tags generally serve as retrieval aids. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Task-oriented dialogue aims the solution of a given task in a given domain. Folksonomies are knowledge structures composed of users, tags and resources. Folksonomies emerge from the tagging process in collaborative tagging systems. Dialogues and folksonomies have in common their social dimension. One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process. This can be useful for instance, to retrieve the topics addressed by the interlocutors of the dialogues, in different time intervals. Experiments with a real-world task-oriented dialogue corpus were done.},

The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Enriching the list of recommended spots with contextual information such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts etc. may further add value to the systems. This paper proposes the concept of information enrichment for a tourist spot recommender system. Proposed system works in collaboration with a Tourist Spot Recommender System, takes the list of spots to be recommended to the current user and collects the current contextual information for those spots. A new score/rank is computed for each spot to be recommender based on the recommender’s rank and current context and sent back to the user. Contextual information may be collected by several techniques such as sensors, collaborative tagging (folksonomy), crowdsourcing etc. This paper proposes an approach for information enrichment using just in time location aware crowdsourcing. Location aware crowdsourcing is used to get current contextual information about a spot from the crowd currently available at that spot. Most of the contextual parameters such as traffic conditions, weather conditions, crowdedness etc. are fuzzy in nature and therefore, fuzzy inference is proposed to compute a new score/rank, with each recommended spot. The proposed system may be used with any spot recommender system, however, in this work a personalized tourist spot recommender system is considered as a case for study and evaluation. A prototype system has been implemented and is evaluated by 104 real users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The problems which occur during the process are analyzed and solutions are proposed. The structure of the folksonomy is also analyzed. It turns out to be a social network graph. Graph features, such as the path length, or the Jaccard similarity coefficient, are the input parameters for a machine learning classifying algorithm. The comparative importance of the parameters is evaluated. Finally, the method was evaluated in the RUSSE evaluation campaign. The results are lower than most results for distribution-based vector models. However, the model itself is cheaper to build.

A variety of automatic and semi-automatic methods exist for extracting or assigning identity to online resources. Although users’ perception about contents and also their interests might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects and always recommend them to the users based on their fixed, defined identities because they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve.

Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects.

  abstract        = {With the advent of the so-called "Web 2.0", the participatory nature of many of its applications has nurtured the vision of many researchers to finally overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck inherent to many Semantic Web applications. Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

  abstract        = {Compared with learning in classrooms, classical e-learning systems are less adaptive and once a system that supports a particular strategy has been designed and implemented, it is less likely to change according to student's interactions and preferences. Remote educational systems should be developed to ensure as much as necessary the personalization of learning tasks. New e-learning environments should appear to act as intelligent systems that better fit the needs of their users and especially students according to their interests, preferences, motivations, objectives and knowledge. In this paper, we present how the personalization of students' learning process leveraging the use of social semantic web, using resource description framework models, ontologies, social networking and collaborative tagging. Our aim is to develop an approach of personalization according to students' preferences, interests and knowledge by defining for them the best learning paths, this means, provide them as recommendations the best collaborators and the relevant resources that better fit their needs. We present a new method of recommendation based on users' similarity calculation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the design, implementation, analysis and evaluation of a social learning environment. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

Nowadays, collaborative labeling has grown in reputation on the web, on sites that permit users to label bookmarks, photographs and other details. It has been recently become useful and well known as one effective way of classifying items for future search, sharing information, and filtering. So, as to predict the future search of users, we propose a novel collaborative tagging-based page recommendation algorithm using fuzzy classifier. The method consists of three phases: Grouping, Rule Generation Phase and Page Recommendation Phase. In the proposed method, we calculate the resemblance of users in selecting tags and thereby, calculate the nearest neighbors of each user and cluster them. Then, the priority of tags and items for each user is calculated for constructing a Nominal Label Matrix and Nominal Page Matrix. Finally, the fuzzy rules are generated for page recommendation. The experimentation is carried out on delicious datasets and the experimental results ensured that the proposed algorithm has achieved the maximum hit ratio of 6.6% for neighborhood size of 20, which is higher than the existing technique which obtained only 5.5%. © 2014, Copyright: the authors.},

  abstract        = {The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three components, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this paper, we develop a dual mining framework to explore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design four sets of efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the dataset, showed that the users' reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants - in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user's choice of resources, and sharing styles. Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a "gain scale" of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.},

  abstract      = {Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

This is not consistent with current scientific evidence, which shows that both types of treatment are about equally effective. Objective: The study investigates whether this bias towards psychotherapy guides online information search and whether the bias can be reduced by explicitly providing expert information (in a blog entry) and by providing tag clouds that implicitly reveal experts' evaluations. Methods: A total of 174 participants completed a fully automated Web-based study after we invited them via mailing lists. First, participants read two blog posts by experts that either challenged or supported the bias towards psychotherapy. Subsequently, participants searched for information about depression treatment in an online environment that provided more experts' blog posts about the effectiveness of treatments based on alleged research findings. These blogs were organized in a tag cloud; both psychotherapy tags and pharmacotherapy tags were popular. We measured tag and blog post selection, efficacy ratings of the presented treatments, and participants' treatment recommendation after information search. Results: Participants demonstrated a clear bias towards psychotherapy (mean 4.53, SD 1.99) compared to pharmacotherapy (mean 2.73, SD 2.41; t173=7.67, P<.001, d=0.81) when rating treatment efficacy prior to the experiment. Accordingly, participants exhibited biased information search and evaluation. This bias was significantly reduced, however, when participants were exposed to tag clouds with challenging popular tags. Participants facing popular tags challenging their bias (n=61) showed significantly less biased tag selection (F2,168=10.61, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.112), blog post selection (F2,168=6.55, P=.002, partial eta squared=0.072), and treatment efficacy ratings (F2,168=8.48, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.092), compared to bias-supporting tag clouds (n=56) and balanced tag clouds (n=57). Challenging (n=93) explicit expert information as presented in blog posts, compared to supporting expert information (n=81), decreased the bias in information search with regard to blog post selection (F1,168=4.32, P=.04, partial eta squared=0.025). No significant effects were found for treatment recommendation (Ps>.33). Conclusions: We conclude that the psychotherapy bias is most effectively attenuated-and even eliminated-when popular tags implicitly point to blog posts that challenge the widespread view. Explicit expert information (in a blog entry) was less successful in reducing biased information search and evaluation. Since tag clouds have the potential to counter biased information processing, we recommend their insertion. © Holly O Witteman.},

  abstract        = {Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

  abstract        = {With the development of the Internet, there are more and more shared resources on the Web. Personalized search becomes increasingly important as users demand higher retrieval quality. Personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags (features) and thus provide a powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. To capture and understand user preferences, a user is typically modeled as a vector of tag:value pairs (i.e., a tag-based user profile) in collaborative tagging systems. In such a tag-based user profile, a user's preference degree on a group of tags (i.e., a combination of several tags) mainly depends on the preference degree on every individual tag in the group. However, the preference degree on a combination of tags (a tag-group) cannot simply be obtained from linearly combining the preference on each tag. The combination of a user's two favorite tags may not be favorite for the user. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To overcome their problems, we model a user profile based on combinations of tags (tag-groups) and then apply it to the personalized search. By comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results on a real data set shows the effectiveness of our proposed user profile method.

Considering the different approaches toward popular songs in catalogues and contemporary systems, this paper identifies possible solutions, such as the use of descriptive metadata, the use of collaborative tagging or the creation of an ontology.

  abstract      = {User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

  abstract        = {The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content sites has created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions on various items such as e-commerce products, restaurants, etc. Ideally, a user wants to quickly decide whether an item is desirable, from the list of items returned as a result of her search query. This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.

These labels are often found to be noisy, mainly due to the collaborative tagging activities of users. Existing methods on annotation have been developed and verified on noise free labels of images. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic framework that exploits the collective knowledge embedded in noisy label co-occurrence pairs to derive robust annotations. We compare our method with a well-known image annotation algorithm and show its superiority in terms of annotation accuracy on benchmark Corel5K and ESP datasets in presence of noisy labels. © Springer-Verlag 2013.},

In this context, we will motivate the use of this tool and we will discuss the differences to model the mashup space as a folksonomy with respect to the traditional use of folksonomies in the Web 2.0.

However, the (offine) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from dificulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets. We show, that a recommender's performance depends on the particular core and explore correlations between performances on different cores. © 2013 ACM.},

Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

However, the simplistic and user-centered design of this kind of systems cause the task of finding personally interesting users is becoming quite out of reach for the common user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation. This is because CF always been attack by malicious users that will make it suffers in finding the truly interesting users. With this problem in mind, this study proposes a hybrid User Trust method to enhance CF in order to increase accuracy of user recommendation in social tagging system. This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. In addition, it indicated that the hybrid method give more accurate recommendation than the existing CF based on user trust. © 2013 Science Publications.},

Moreover, only the matching degree of a tag with another tag is calculated, while the effects of tags as a whole on the user's preference are ignored. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on the tag-group effect, namely, TGER. This algorithm utilizes the user ratings on resources to select the tag-groups which have significant effects on the user's preference, and adopts the high-dimension tag-group first matching method to calculate the user-resource relevance. Experimental results on the MovieLens data set show that TGER can significantly improve the recommendation quality.},

Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.},

To enhance the performance of personalized service recommendation in collaborative tagging systems, not only tag information but also time and social relations information should be considered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method aiming at taking advantage of tag, time and users' social relations information for a preferable service recommendation. We first improve a simple tag-based recommendation method by a time-decay function. Then we develop a temporal social-based recommendation method which analyzes user familiarity and user preference similarity between friends. Based on these two steps we integrate them as a temporal tag-and social-based (TTS) recommendation algorithm. Experiment results indicate that our method outperforms general tag-based and social-based recommendation methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Folksonomy, a system for social tagging or collaborative tagging, is popular in Semantic Web research. Folksonomy is applied to items, such as music pieces, which their personalized tags can be annotated by users. Recommendation systems can use these tags to produce meaningful information. Clustering methods, such as the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) method, can be applied in the context of recommendation system. This paper proposes the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (IFAHC) algorithm for recommendation using social tagging. The Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) concept is used to represent tag values which are vague and uncertain. IFAHC can cluster items represented by using IFS into different groups. The application of IFAHC to music recommendation is used to demonstrate the usability of the proposed method. © 2015 IEEE.},

A method based on the tripartite model (actors, concepts and instances) induces from social applications a folksonomy related to a domain of knowledge. The hypothesis of this paper is that if folksonomies are shared conceptualizations, then using them in conceptual modeling should reduce the number of divergences between actors when they elicit terms to be part of a model (a concept map in this article). A controlled experiment of conceptual modeling was performed with experimental groups who received tags inducted from data of categorizations from Delicious and control groups who received terms extracted from Web pages categorized on Delicious. The results show that the experimental groups obtained less divergences (on average) in elicitation of terms when compared to control groups. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

But sometimes it is also used as a way to express opinions, which is normally done through rating-or text review systems. This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies. © 2013 IEEE.},

A Rules Engine is used to manage a set of rules for each user to achieve personalized recommendation. The rules which define the relationship between tags construct the relationship graph model for users and learning resources thus graph-based collaborative filtering recommendation methods can be implemented.

Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

It is possible to capture the semantics from user tagging into some form of ontology, but the application of the resulted ontology for recommendation making has not been that flourishing. In this paper we discuss our approach to learn domain ontology from user tagging information and apply the extracted tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment. The initial result shows that by using the tag ontology to re-rank the recommended tags, the accuracy of the tag recommendation can be improved. © 2011 IEEE.},

State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

The multi-agent systems paradigm coordinated by selforganisation mechanisms has been used as an effective way for the design and modeling of such systems. Existing tagging systems do not take full advantage of their complex systems characteristics, especially in adapting to their environment and allowing emergence. In this paper, we propose a model for designing a tagging system, using a multi-agent system approach, governed by the co-evolution of the social and spatial organisations of the agents. We show how the proposed system has new functionalities that could enhance current collaborative tagging systems. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Tagging is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 web sites. A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {As the number of Web services dramatically increases, it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for user to find the desired Web services. Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between cooccurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {With ubiquitous access to Web 2.0 applications, users on social networks can now collaboratively author and share hypermedia learning resources, contributing to more engaging learning experiences in Technology-Enhanced Learning outside formal education. Though these resources are ready to be harnessed for educational purposes, they may or may not be educational or may be suitable for some users only. Hence, it is crucial to annotate these resources to personalize these resources to different user needs. We propose to annotate learning resources with folksonomy-derived description metadata for personalization to context profiles of users. A semantic model for folksonomy was formulated to integrate controlled vocabularies in folksonomy. It not only reduces reliance on domain experts in annotating learning resources but also opens new avenues for more comprehensive resource description, compared to numerical ratings in resource recommendation algorithm. The working principle of the resource annotation and recommendation mechanism is demonstrated via a prototype system implemented in a social network environment. A pilot user study shows that learners are positive about the system in terms of aspects apart from accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.},

However, the nature of annotations (i.e. global level) and the noise existing in the associated information (due to lack of structure, ambiguity, redundancy, and emotional tagging), prevents them from being readily compatible (i.e. accurate region level annotations) with the existing methods for training object detectors. We present a novel approach to overcome this deficiency using the collective knowledge aggregated in social sites to automatically determine a set of image regions that can be associated with a certain object. We study theoretically and experimentally when the prevailing trends (in terms of appearance frequency) in visual and tag information space converge into the same object, and how this convergence is influenced by the number of utilized images and the accuracy of the visual analysis algorithms. Evaluation results show that although the models trained using leveraged social media are inferior to the ones trained manually, there are cases where the user contributed content can be successfully used to facilitate scalable and effortless learning of object detectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the techniques used in traditional information retrieval systems do not meet the requirements of users who want to take into account their social preferences. The idea reported in this paper is about including not only the social context of the user but also the one for the resource. In the social network that we consider, the user social context brings its interests, which are captured from a collaborative tagging system, while the resource social context is related to clusters of tags, obtained by classification method, and users' opinions according to their expertise level on the resource. The results of our experiment evaluation on real-world datasets (crawled from delicious folksonomy) demonstrate significant improvements over traditional retrieval approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

A recommender system compares user profiles to some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item that they have not yet considered.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommender systems. These methods are based on collecting and analyzing the information of a particular user behavior, activity, preferences and will predict the user's interest according to the similarity of other users. In this paper we address the problem of scalability associated with CF and propose a CF framework that combines collaborative tagging with genre interestingness measure for a movie RS. Our experiments on each movie dataset with recent timestamp demonstrate that the proposed CFT -GIM gives more accurate predictions of user's ratings as compared to both CF and CFT.},

There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model.We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes.

  abstract        = {The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system provides relevance searching, which is more effective than traditional keyword searching for searching personal resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

We present TagScore, a scoring function to rate the goodness of Del.icio.us tags for their associated web page. It gives us a succinct synopsis for a page that we can use to efficiently find similar pages. Using real Del.icio.us data, we show that our approach gives good correlation to cosine similarity but is several hundred times faster and requires minimal storage overhead. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging on the web has been quickly gaining ground as a new paradigm for web information retrieval, discovering and filtering. There are a number of successful deployments of collaborative tagging systems that effectively recruits the activity of human users into collecting and annotating vast amounts of web resources. They lead to an emergent categorization of web resources in terms of tags, and create a different kind of web directory. However, the current ways of exploration in the tagging space are limited, which cannot get the most out of the real value of it. This paper presents our methodology, observations, and experimental results in the way we propose how to improve the user experience in exploring information captured by collaborative tagging systems. © 2006 IEEE.},

In this paper, we exploit a popular type of metadata called collaborative tags to address this issue. Specifically, we identify basic level concepts and then construct ontologies from the collaborative tags. The generated ontologies can be employed to organize and index user-generated multimedia data. Existing research lacks a principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human perspective. In contrast, we borrow the idea of a family of concepts called basic level concepts from cognitive psychology. These basic level concepts are frequently used by people in their daily life and when organizing human knowledge. In this paper, we extract ontologies with basic level concepts from collaborative tags. Furthermore, we model the effect of context and present a method for context-aware basic level concepts detection for ontology learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on context-aware basic level concept detection in collaborative tagging for the construction of ontologies. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were conducted on real datasets using the Open Directory Project (ODP) as a benchmark. The experimental results illustrate that ontologies extracted by our approach are more rational and human-oriented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage points. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Confronting such a vast volume of resources in collaborative tagging systems, users require a novel method for fast exploring and indexing so as to find their desired data. To this end, contextual information is indispensable and critical in understanding user preferences and intentions. In sociolinguistics, context can be classified as verbal context and social context. Compared with verbal context, social context requires not only domain knowledge to build pre-defined contextual attributes but also additional user data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed the issue of irrelevant contextual factors for the verbal context model. To bridge this gap, the dominating set obtained from verbal context is proposed in this paper. We present (i) the verbal context graph to model contents and interrelationships of verbal context in folksonomy and thus capture the user intention; (ii) a method of discovering dominating set that provides a good balance of essentiality and integrality to de-emphasize irrelevant contextual factors and to keep the major characteristics of the verbal context graph; and (iii) a revised ranking method for measuring the relevance of a resource to an issued query, a discovered context and an extracted user profile. The experimental results obtained for a public dataset illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than existing baseline approaches. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {Social tagging, also noted as collaborative tagging or folksonomy, is an important way for users themselves to describe resources on the Web. The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract        = {Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract        = {With the increase in resource-sharing websites such as YouTube and Flickr, many shared resources have arisen on the Web. Personalized searches have become more important and challenging since users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized searches need to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provides a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized searches. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in collaborative tagging systems. We use a normalized term frequency to indicate the preference degree of a user on a tag. A novel search method using such profiles of users and resources is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource searches. In our framework, instead of the keyword matching or similarity measurement used in previous works, the relevance measurement between a resource and a user query (termed the query relevance) is treated as a fuzzy satisfaction problem of a user's query requirements. We implement a prototype system called the Folksonomy-based Multimedia Retrieval System (FMRS). Experiments using the FMRS data set and the MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {In the era of big data, collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems have proliferated as a consequence of the growth of Web 2.0 communities. Constructing user profiles from folksonomy systems is useful for many applications such as personalized search and recommender systems. The identification of latent user communities is one way to better understand and meet user needs. The behavior of users is highly influenced by the behavior of their neighbors or community members, and this can be utilized in constructing user profiles. However, conventional user profiling techniques often encounter data sparsity problems as data from a single user is insufficient to build a powerful profile. Hence, in this paper we propose a method of enriching user profiles based on latent user communities in folksonomy data. Specifically, the proposed approach contains four sub-processes: (i) tag-based user profiles are extracted from a folksonomy tripartite graph; (ii) a multi-faceted folksonomy graph is constructed by integrating tag and image affinity subgraphs with the folksonomy tripartite graph; (iii) random walk distance is used to unify various relationships and measure user similarities; (iv) a novel prototype-based clustering method based on user similarities is used to identify user communities, which are further used to enrich the extracted user profiles. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a public dataset, the results of which show that our approach outperforms previous ones in user profile enrichment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Recently collaborative tagging, also known as "folksonomy" in Web 2.0, allows users to collaboratively create and manage tags to classify and categorize dynamic content for searching and sharing. A user's interest in social resources usually changes with time in such a dynamic and information rich environment. Additionally, a social network is one innovative characteristic in social resource sharing websites. The information from a social network provides an inference of a certain user's interests based on the interests of this user's network neighbors. To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user's social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the "social friends" network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system's performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user's preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, in this context there are sides to recommendation quality requiring further characterisation and methodological research - a gap that is acknowledged in the field. We present a comparative study on the influence that different types of information available in social systems have on item recommendation. Aiming to identify which sources of user interest evidence - tags, social contacts, and user-item interaction data - are more effective to achieve useful recommendations, and in what aspect, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering, and social recommenders on three datasets obtained from Delicious, Last. fm, and MovieLens. Aiming to determine whether and how combining such information sources may enhance over individual recommendation approaches, we extend the common accuracy-oriented evaluation practice with various metrics to measure further recommendation quality dimensions, namely coverage, diversity, novelty, overlap, and relative diversity between ranked item recommendations. We report empiric observations showing that exploiting tagging information by content-based recommenders provides high coverage and novelty, and combining social networking and collaborative filtering information by hybrid recommenders results in high accuracy and diversity. This, along with the fact that recommendation lists from the evaluated approaches had low overlap and relative diversity values between them, gives insights that meta-hybrid recommenders combining the above strategies may provide valuable, balanced item suggestions in terms of performance and non-performance metrics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web.

  abstract        = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O.n/.},

These systems allow users to organize, manage and search the required resource freely, thus by combination and integration of recommendation systems in social software, assisting users to appropriately assign tag to resources and try to improve annotation among users. The challenges of recommendation systems are large-scale data, inconsistence data, usage of time-consuming machine learning algorithms, long and unreasonable time of recommendation and not being scalable to the demands of real world applications. Recently more efforts have been conducted to solve these problems. In this paper we proposed a tag recommendation system that is able to work with large-scale data and being applied in real world. The proposed system's evaluation performed on a dataset collected from Delicious.com. The results demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of proposed system. © 2011 IEEE.},

Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users' Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A folder is usually assumed to store the semantically related information in the form of files and sub-folders. However, there always exist related files somewhere else in the local file system hierarchy. Users often fail to find these disconnected files or discover the relationship among these. File systems maintain a plain set of metadata items about each file which could be utilized to discover some of the hidden relationships. However, this meta-information is very sparse as most of this metadata is rarely entered by the user. Moreover, files in a file system are mostly private and cannot get the benefit of collaborative tagging. Web of Data, on the other hand also contains information related to the file system objects which could be utilized for linking with information in file systems.

One important problem is how to find out experts who are qualified and willing to answer the question. Also, with the rapidly increasing number of new questions, experts of experienced in specified domains are not easy to find their interested questions. In this paper, we assume that the ones who have relationships with the questioner are more willing to answer the questions proposed by the questioner than other people. Based on this assumption, we explore the problem of Social Question and Answering and proposed a method to find out the experts who are qualified and willing to answer the questions based on the social relationships of the questioner.},

One of the challenging issues in this area is to successfully understand customers' affective needs and to interpret it in terms of product design elements. Previous studies have attempted to obtain customer's affective needs using manual approaches, e.g. survey, which is time-consuming and a costly process. In relation, the study for such a need is usually limited to a number of product features only. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative tagging approach for discovering product features, affective description and their associations from product review analysis. Specifically, we have discussed on the tagging task assignment, tags aggregation and performance analysis of our proposal. A case study on discovering feature-affective associations from car reviews is reported to showcase the feasibility of our approach.},

The similarity of objects on the web (e.g., webpages, photos, music, micro-blogs, and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects in many recent applications. SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes.},

Although tags may not be per se sensitive information, the wide use of collaborative tagging services increases the risk of cross referencing, thereby seriously compromising user privacy. In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users.},
