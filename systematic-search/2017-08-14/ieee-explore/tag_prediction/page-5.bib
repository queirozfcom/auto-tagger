title={Interest Analysis Using Semantic PageRank and Social Interaction Content},
year={2013},
pages={929-936},
abstract={Social media has long been a popular resource for sentiment analysis and data mining. In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.},

year={2014},
volume={14},

pages={1193-1197},
abstract={In this paper, we report a frequency-modulated (FM) passive wireless sensor tag for ammonia (NH3) sensing. The passive wireless sensor tag consists of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network based NH3 sensor, a radio frequency antenna, a ring oscillator, and other supporting circuits. The SWCNT network-based NH3 sensor is fabricated on a flexible plastic substrate through printable processes. The printable SWCNT-based NH3 sensor shows an enhanced sensitivity of 0.76% per part per million primarily due to the large surface area of the SWCNT network. The sensor also exhibits a high linearity between the resistance of the sensor and logarithm of the NH3 concentration (referred to as log [NH3] henceforth). A simple FM circuit is designed to convert the resistance change of the sensor to the oscillating frequency shift of the circuit. By properly designing the circuit, we have obtained a linear response between the frequency shift and log [NH3]. The linear response allows one to precisely predict the NH3 concentration by measuring the frequency shift of the FM wireless sensor tag. Such an FM-modulated passive wireless sensor tag with linear response and enhanced sensitivity is promising for power-less stand-alone low-level NH3 sensing and monitoring with high accuracy.},

year={2013},
pages={4307-4311},
abstract={We investigate an image classification task where the training images come along with tags, but only a subset being labeled, and the goal is to predict the class label of test images without tags. This task is crucial for image search engine on photo sharing Web sites. In previous work, it is handled by first learning a multiple kernel learning classifier using both image content and tags to score unlabeled training images, and then building up a least-squares regression (LSR) model on visual features to predict the label of test images. However, there exist three important issues in the task: (1) Image tags on photo sharing Web sites tend to be inaccurate and incomplete, and thus refining them is beneficial; (2) Supervised learning with a limited number of labeled samples may be unreliable to some extent, while a graph-based semi-supervised approach can be adopted by also considering similarities of unlabeled data; (3) LSR is established upon centered visual kernel columns and breaks the symmetry of kernel matrix, whereas support vector regression can readily use the original visual kernel and thus leverage its full power. To handle the task more effectively, we propose to combine tag refinement, graph-based learning and support vector regression together. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC'07 and MIR Flickr datasets show the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract={User preference modeling is the basis for the provision of personal information services because it can reflect the user's characteristics and interests. Tagging is a popular online activity that allows a user to discover, describe, and organize Internet contents. Tagging provides a new means of creating user preference. Tags explain and describe items so that a user's attitude toward a tag is his or her attitude toward an aspect of the item. In this paper we design Tagpref inspired by the method of establishing user preference with tags. The user's preference was described by the user's preference degrees for different tags. Different algorithms were proposed and evaluated for taggers and non-taggers on Movie Lens based on direct and indirect behavior. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithms can accurately predict a user's tag preference. The user's attitude toward tag preference was also analyzed. Users' true preference was determined by an online user survey.},

abstract={Could Social Media, and in particular, microblogs such as Twitter, play a part in helping to track criminal movement? The aim of this paper is to narrow the focus of this broader problem of using social media to crowdsource information to assist in the fight against crime, to the specific problem of identifying the description of vehicles in microblog text. As this problem has many aspects, especially in terms of data gathering and identification, an initial search is performed on preset keywords and the resulting database is tagged. The tags are then analysed to determine which features are the most common. Topic models are then run on the data to determine if any useful keyword can be found for further searches and initial statistics are recorded as a baseline for further processing. Our primary concern is establishing the common content of the relevant Tweets. The result could be used both for help with data collection as well as with feature selection when learning classification algorithms for data mining.},

abstract={The study of human activity patterns traditionally relies on the continuous tracking of user location. We approach the problem of activity pattern discovery from a new perspective which is rapidly gaining attention. Instead of actively sampling increasing volumes of sensor data, we explore the participatory sensing potential of multiple mobile social networks, on which users often disclose information about their location and the venues they visit. In this paper, we present automated techniques for filtering, aggregating, and processing combined social networking traces with the goal of extracting descriptions of regularly-occurring user activities, which we refer to as “user routines”. We report our findings based on two localized data sets about a single pool of users: the former contains public geotagged Twitter messages, the latter Foursquare check-ins that provide us with meaningful venue information about the locations we observe. We analyze and combine the two datasets to highlight their properties and show how the emergent features can enhance our understanding of users' daily schedule. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the potential of routine descriptions for predicting future user activity and location.},

year={2013},
pages={341-346},
abstract={The need for fast address translation within tight time constraints (before L1 tag check but after effective address computation) imposes many design constraints. The freedom from such constraints can potentially lead to lower TLB energy costs. In this paper, we observe that (1) data accesses commonly use base-displacement addressing modes in which the effective address is computed as the sum of a base and a displacement, and (2) the effective page numbers are predictable once the base address is known. Further, it is easy to cache address translations alongside the predicted page numbers thus enabling speculative address translation that can filter accesses to the TLB. The two observations enable our PreTrans design in which (a) a speculative translation is available based solely on the base address, and (b) the translation is available simultaneously with the effective (virtual) address. PreTrans replaces most of the energy-expensive CAM-lookups for TLB access with RAM lookups, which translates to significant power improvements in the TLB.},

title={Tag recommendation in software information sites},
year={2013},
pages={287-296},
abstract={Nowadays, software engineers use a variety of online media to search and become informed of new and interesting technologies, and to learn from and help one another. We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively. Moreover, averaging over StackOverflow and Freecode results, we improve TagRec proposed by Al-Kofahi et al. by 22.65% and 14.95%, and the tag recommendation method proposed by Zangerle et al. by 18.5% and 7.35% for recall@5 and recall@10 scores.},

abstract={Annotating documents with keywords or `tags' is useful for categorizing documents and helping users find a document efficiently and quickly. Question and answer (Q&A) sites also use tags to categorize questions to help ensure that their users are aware of questions related to their areas of expertise or interest. However, someone asking a question may not necessarily know the best way to categorize or tag the question, and automatically tagging or categorizing a question is a challenging task. Since a Q&A site may host millions of questions with tags and other data, this information can be used as a training and test dataset for approaches that automatically suggest tags for new questions. In this paper, we mine data from millions of questions from the Q&A site Stack Overflow, and using a discriminative model approach, we automatically suggest question tags to help a questioner choose appropriate tags for eliciting a response.},

abstract={Sand monitoring gives the benefits of avoiding equipment erosion and production failure in the oil industry. This paper presents the design and implementation of a reliable and cost-effective sand monitoring system for measuring sand production in gas and oil flows in real time. The designed monitoring system involves two acoustic emission (AE) sensors and one Doppler sensor for gauging the sand impaction and the velocity of sand particles in a nonintrusive manner, respectively. It is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) as a prototype for real-time data acquisition and processing, and evaluated using a testbed pump skid available in our laboratory. Relying on a low-cost FPGA board to integrate all acquisition and processing functionality, our monitoring system can measure the sand production amount on-the-fly reliably with high accuracy, according to our experimental evaluation. It is likely to achieve better accuracy than one without the Doppler sensor. The proposed monitoring system is affordable for wide deployment, given its high accuracy, good resilience to surrounding noise, and low cost (when compared with commercially available systems whose price tags can be some tenfold higher).},

title={A Method for Predicting Perishing Services in a Service Ecosystem},
year={2013},
pages={13-17},
abstract={With the wide adoption of Service-oriented Architecture, we can observe a rapid increase of web services these days. These services with their compositions produced by consumers form a service ecosystem. However as time goes by, some of the services are no longer available or says perishing due to the competition among the ecosystem. Obviously, compositions invoking these perishing services are also becoming unavailable. Thus, choosing the services which are more stable can help the consumers to product more valuable composition. The goal of this paper is to find a way to separate the potential perishing services in the ecosystem so that we can give suggestions to service consumers and help them develop more durable and valuable compositions. Firstly, we study the competition relation between services by their user tags and establish a service-service competition network. Based on the network analysis, we extract the common feature of perishing services and formalize this feature as percentage ranking (PR) of services. Finally, we propose a classification algorithm to predict potential perishing services. With the good performance in recall and precision rate, our algorithm is credible for identifying potential perishing services thus we can suggest the consumers to select more durable services for their compositions.},

abstract={User-generated content (UGC) video systems by definition heavily depend on the input of their community of users and their social interactions for video diffusion and opinion sharing. Nevertheless, we show in this paper, through measurement and analysis of YouKu, the most popular UGC video system in China, that the social connectivity of its users is very low. These observations are consistent with what was reported about YouTube in previous works. As a UGC system can achieve a larger audience through improved connectivity, our findings motivate us to propose a mean to enhance the users' connectivity by taking benefit of friend recommendation. To this end, we assess two similarity metrics based on users' interests that are derived from their uploads and favorites tagging of videos, to evaluate the interest similarity between friends. The results consistently show that friends share to a great extent common interests. Two friend recommendation algorithms are then proposed. The algorithms use public information provided by users to suggest potential friends with similar interests as measured by the similarity metrics. Experiments on our gathered YouKu dataset demonstrate that the social connectivity can be greatly enhanced by our friend proposition set and that users can access a larger set of interesting videos through the recommendations.},

abstract={Traditional visual classification approaches focus on predicting absence/presence of labels or attributes for images. However, it is sometimes useful to predict the ratings of the labels or attributes endowed with an ordinal scale (e.g., “very important,” “important” or “not important”). The ordinal scale representation allows us to describe object classes more precisely than simple binary tagging. In this work, we propose a new method where each label/attribute can be assigned to a finite set of ordered ratings, from most to least relevant. Object classes are then predicted using these ratings. Experiments on Animals with Attributes dataset demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and show its advantages over previous methods based on binary tagging and multi-class classification.},

But, because of privacy and security reasons, most of the people on social networking sites like Twitter are unwilling to provide locations in their profiles. This creates a need for an algorithm that predicts the location of the user based on the implicit attributes associated with him. In this paper, we develop a tool, Tweecalization that predicts the location of the user purely on the basis of his social network, using the strong theoretical framework of semi-supervised learning. In particular we employ the label propagation algorithm. On the city locations returned by the algorithm, the system performs agglomerative clustering based on geospatial proximity and their individual scores to return cluster of locations with higher confidence. We perform extensive experiments to show the validity of our system in terms of both accuracy and running time. Experimental results show that Tweecalization outperforms the content based geo-tagging approach and the Tweethood algorithm [4] in both accuracy and running time.},

abstract={We present a two step procedure to identify long lasting communities, or evolutions, in social networks. First, we use axiomatic foundations to `rigorously' establish shorter, strongly-connected evolutions. In the second step, we use heuristics to combine these shorter evolutions to form longer evolutions. We apply the procedure on data generated from two networks - the DBLP co-authorship database and Live Journal blog data. We visually validate our algorithms by examining the topic evolution of the associated documents. Our results demonstrate that our algorithms, based solely on structural properties of the data (who interacts with whom), are able to track thematic trends in the literature. We then use a machine learning framework to identify the structural features of the early stages of a community's evolution are most useful for predicting the lifetime of the community. We find that (in order) size, intensity and stability are the most important features.},

pages={827-834},
abstract={Social Bookmarking systems enable users to store, organize and search their resources. Furthermore, a social bookmarking system allows users to share their resources with others and even join groups of people with similar interests. The data size in social bookmarking systems has been increased sharply in recent years with the usage of such systems. However, such systems attract spammers due to their ease of use and popularity. Spammers have started misleading search engines and other bookmarking system users in order to direct web traffic towards their own pages. Strong prevention and detection methods in social bookmarking systems are indispensable in order to stop spam activities and guaranty the accuracy and reliability of information. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for spam detection task in social bookmarking systems. Here, we propose a set of new features to improve the accuracy of spammer detection. Our experiments show that our features demonstrate a high discriminative power. A performance evaluation of our proposed method over different spammer detection methods indicate that the proposed framework yields an improvement of the prediction accuracy.},

abstract={Trust-ware recommender systems provide the features of personalized product and service recommendations in web based social networks by using the trust connections existing between users and preferences data available for each user. One of the main sources of user preferences data are the tags that users apply to different items. Encouraging users to apply more tags is one of the challenges faced by most social network sites. In this paper we purpose an approach to identify influential taggers in a trust based social network so that efforts to encourage tagging can be achieved by designing incentives for motivating the influential taggers to apply more tags. In our proposed approach, for every user his tagging influencer is that user in his personal network who has influenced his tagging behavior the most. We define an active user tagging actions has been influenced by a user in his personal network only when the active user tags an item after his influencer has tagged it. The influential taggers in the overall social network are those who have the influenced the maximum number of users in the network. We analyze the real life dataset of Last.fm to show that our approach is different from the current approach of defining those users who have tagged the maximum number of items as the influential users. We also discuss the implications of using our approach.},

In this paper, we briefly describe an implementation framework which has been carefully engineered to meet the needs of an important class of k-anonymity algorithms. We have implemented and evaluated two major well-known algorithms within this framework and show that it allows for highly efficient implementations. Regarding their runtime behaviour, we were able to closely reproduce the results from previous publications but also found some algorithmic limitations. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm that achieves very good performance by implementing a novel strategy and exploiting different aspects of our implementation framework. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our algorithm offers algorithmic stability, with execution time being independent of the actual representation of the input data. Experiments with different real-world datasets show that our solution clearly outperforms the previous algorithms.},

year={2012},
pages={1125-1130},
abstract={A well-know method to avoid inconsistent state in Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a globally shared version clock whose values are used to tag memory locations. While this method does not require frequent validation of transactional data, it results in contentions over the global clock. Each time that a transaction commits it updates the global clock which results in costly coherence misses. The alternative approach is local clock which requires access to local variables instead of a global version clock. However, as we show in this paper, the optimum validation policy changes not only across applications but also within an application and through different phases of a program. To counter this challenge, we introduce Speculative Versioning (SV) which dynamically selects one of the two validation techniques based on probability of conflicts. SV is a speculative approach and relies on perceptron predictors to predict future conflicts. We have incorporated SV into TL2 and compared the performance of the new implementation with the original STM using Stamp v0.9.10 benchmark suite. Our results reveal that SV is effective and improves execution time of transactional applications up to 31%.},

abstract={Increasingly developed social sharing websites like Flickr and Youtube allow users to create, share, annotate, and comment medias. The large-scale user-generated metadata not only facilitate users in sharing and organizing multimedia content, but provide useful information to improve media retrieval and management. Personalized search serves as one of such examples where the web search experience is improved by generating the returned list according to the modified user search intents. In this paper, we exploit the social annotations and propose a novel framework simultaneously considering the user and query relevance to learn to personalized image search. The basic premise is to embed the user preference and query-related search intent into user-specific topic spaces. Since the users' original annotation is too sparse for topic modeling, we need to enrich users' annotation pool before user-specific topic spaces construction. The proposed framework contains two components: (1) a ranking-based multicorrelation tensor factorization model is proposed to perform annotation prediction, which is considered as users' potential annotations for the images; (2) we introduce user-specific topic modeling to map the query relevance and user preference into the same user-specific topic space. For performance evaluation, two resources involved with users' social activities are employed. Experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Disk schedulers should provide QoS guarantees to applications, thus sharing proportionally the storage resource and enforcing performance isolation. Disk schedulers must execute requests in an efficient order though, preventing poor disk usage. Non-work-conserving disk schedulers help to increase disk throughput by predicting future requests' arrival and therefore exploiting disk spatial locality. Previous work are limited to either provide QoS guarantees or exploit disk spatial locality. In this paper, we propose a new non-work-conserving disk scheduler called High-throughput Token Bucket Scheduler (HTBS), which can provide both QoS guarantees and high throughput by (a) assigning tags to requests in a fair queuing-like fashion and (b) predicting future requests' arrival. We show through experiments with our Linux Kernel implementation that HTBS outperforms previous QoS aware work-conserving disk schedulers throughput as well as provides tight QoS guarantees, unlike other non-work-conserving algorithms.},

abstract={In centroid-based classification, each class is represented by a prototype or centroid document vector that is formed by averaging all member vectors during the training phase. In the prediction phase, the label of a test document vector is assigned to that of its nearest class prototype. Recently there has been revived interest in reformulating the prototype/centroid to improve classification performance. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the recently proposed Class Feature Centroid (CFC) classifier by considering the rate of change of each prototype vector with respect to individual dimensions (terms). The implication of our theoretical finding is that CFC is inherently biased towards large (dominant majority) classes, which means it is destined to perform poorly for highly class-imbalanced data. Another practical concern about CFC lies in its overly-aggressive design in weeding out terms that appear in all classes. To overcome these CFC limitations while retaining its intrinsic and worthy design goals, we propose an improved and robust centroid-based classifier that uses precise term-class distribution properties instead of simple presence or absence of terms in classes. Specifically, terms are weighted based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure between pairs of class-conditional term probabilities, we call this the CFC-KL centroid classifier. We then generalized CFC-KL to handle multi-class data by summing pair wise class-conditioned word probability ratios. Our proposed approach has been evaluated on 5 datasets, on which it consistently outperforms CFC and the baseline Support Vector Machine classifier. We also devise a word cloud visualization approach to highlight the important class-specific words picked out by our CFC-KL, and visually compare it with other popular term weigthing approaches. Our encouraging results show that the centroid based generalized CFC-KL classifier is both robust and efficient to deal with real-world text c- assification.},

abstract={After revealing the complete human genome, computational biology shifted towards the study of associations between complex diseases and genetic markers. Given that the number of human DNA variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), account for a small percentage of the whole genome, accurate and informative results have become possible. However, a major limitation in association studies is the cost of genotyping SNPs. Therefore, finding a small subset of tag SNPs to be used as good representatives of the rest of the SNPs is essential. In this work, we combine few successful strategies from the literature and present a parallel genetic algorithm for the Tag SNP Selection problem. Our results compared favorably with those of a recognized tag SNP selection algorithm using three different data sets from the HapMap project.},

abstract={Since market segmentation brings the need of personalized service and long tail phenomenon is continuously proven in the Internet applications, recommendation systems have been paid more and more attention. Item-based collaborative filtering algorithms as the one of most widely used and successful recommendation technology have been continuously improved. But traditional item-based collaborative filtering algorithms cannot solve the data sparseness and the "cold start" problems properly, and handle the over-reliance on the user rating information without consideration of the user's rating subjective factor. With the growing up of Web2.0, tag has been widely used, which allows users to define characteristics of objects from their own point of view. As a consequence, the interaction between the user and recommendation system is improved, and a new way of thinking to improve the quality of recommendation is provided as considering the view point of user in the recommendation. This paper uses tag-based method to calculate the similarity between users, and in the process of calculating item similarity, which makes use of TAG to calculate the similarity between the current user and each user in the candidate set to filter out users with different interest points, thereby it enhances the credibility of item similarity and guarantees the quality of recommendation quality as well. And based on mentioned above, the recommendation system framework is designed, meanwhile which facilitates further research.},

pages={1-4},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a database search peptide sequencing algorithm, called PMF-MI (Parent Mass Filter with Mass Index), that work well on spectra with missing peaks and few tags, such as the GPM database. The main idea in PMF-MI is to use the parent mass as an effective filter for the set of putative peptides to be considered. Then, this set of putative peptides can be globally matches against the given spectrum for scoring. This method eliminates the need for having tags to filter the peptide database. Similar ideas have been proposed in the past, we push this idea further by performing a full pre-indexing of all the peptides in the database by their parent masses. This pre indexing of the peptide database has to be performed only once and based on current database sizes, the entire index uses only 20GB. A typical parent mass of a given spectrum will produce a set of about 200,000 putative peptides on average which our index can retrieve in less than a second. We ran our PMF-MI algorithm on the GPM spectra where the annotated peptide agrees with the precursor peptide mass of the spectra. On this dataset of 877 spectra, our PMF-MI algorithm is competitive with INSPECT, the state of the art database search method today. Our PMF-MI recovered 367 correct peptides compared to 376 for INSPECT (based on top 10 ranked results).},

year={2010},
pages={472-479},
abstract={Exploiting the locality of blocks in the same set, LRU replacement strategy has deficiencies to manage L2 cache resources as the temporal locality has filtered by L1 caches. Instead, reuse replacement strategy develops the reuse characteristics of blocks in entire cache scope being more potential to improve cache resources utilization. We use reuse replacement to manage L2 cache resources in chip multiprocessors (CMP) and propose a new partitioning mechanism named PAD (Partitioning based on dynamic Allocation of Data entries). PAD divides the tag array into sub-arrays and the data array into private and shared data regions, and partitions cache resources among cores depending on their memory access demand. As data entries are dynamically allocated to tag entries by reuse replacement strategy, a core that have obtained more data entries in time interval can have a higher demand of cache resources. Collecting occupied data entries, a PAD algorithm with initial, partitioning and rollback stages is proposed to decide the amount of cache resources assigned to each core. Capacity adjustment is accomplished by allocating data entries from the private data region or the shared data region. Using programs from PARSEC benchmark to build multi-threaded and multi-programmed applications, our experiments show that this new scheme can achieve an average IPC improvement of 22.33% on both traditional private and shared cache organizations.},

The proposed method applies different automatic classification algorithms to improve classification quality by using social tags.

year={2010},
pages={259-268},
abstract={Software quality researchers build software quality models by recovering traceability links between bug reports in issue tracking repositories and source code files. However, all too often the data stored in issue tracking repositories is not explicitly tagged or linked to source code. Researchers have to resort to heuristics to tag the data (e.g., to determine if an issue is a bug report or a work item), or to link a piece of code to a particular issue or bug. Recent studies by Bird et al. and by Antoniol et al. suggest that software models based on imperfect datasets with missing links to the code and incorrect tagging of issues, exhibit biases that compromise the validity and generality of the quality models built on top of the datasets. In this study, we verify the effects of such biases for a commercial project that enforces strict development guidelines and rules on the quality of the data in its issue tracking repository. Our results show that even in such a perfect setting, with a near-ideal dataset, biases do exist - leading us to conjecture that biases are more likely a symptom of the underlying software development process instead of being due to the used heuristics.},

abstract={Functioning as an “address tag” that directs nascent proteins to their proper sub-cellular localizations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. In the past twenty years, many algorithms have been proposed for predicting signal peptides. In spite of pioneering algorithms based on “scaled window” or “benchmark window”, similarity as another method for identification signal peptides is studied in details. By defining the similarity between every two sequences, we take the entire sequence effect into consideration, which is the important problem in modeling the whole amino acid sequence, and avoid the effect of variable-length problem. The normalized similarity represented the similarity among the overall sample is coincide with meaning of neighbours. So K-NN is adopted for classification. Then secretory proteins are identified based on similarity, similarity feature and SSLDA based reduced similarity features. And the prediction result for benchmark dataset is promising. The proposed similarity can also be used for other protein sequence analysis.},

abstract={Classifying documents as protein-protein interaction (PPI) relevant or not is the first step towards extracting meaningful PPI data from article content. Currently, this classification step is handled manually by expert curators. A number of text-mining methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, using abstracts without references. We propose that article references contain important information that can be used to enhance these previous techniques. We trained an SVM classifier solely based on reference links extracted from Biocreative II data to test the effect of references. Our approach includes a feature selection method based on reference count imbalance between positive and negative examples. Classification results on Biocreative II test and Biocreative II.5 training datasets show that even simple referential information extracted from papers can be effective for predicting protein interaction.},

abstract={In order to decrease the traffic in the wireless sensor networks, a gene expression programming based temporal data aggregation technique (GEP-WSNDA) is presented. Two matching predictors with the same GEP-WSNDA models are deployed at the server and the node respectively, which predict the next immediate sampling value simultaneously. The sampling value and new model are sent to the server only when the difference between the actual and the predicted value at the node exceeds a certain threshold. Besides, since its own intrinsic characteristics, GEP-WSNDA solves the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. By employing GEP-WSNDA, the experiments on ocean air temperature data 2007 reached the expectation and made a precise prediction. When error threshold is 0.05deg, it can filter about 80% data and remain high precision.},

By searching the known miRNAs from 20 plant species against EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) sequences with bioinformatics methods, 71 miRNAs belonging to 48 families were predicted from this crop. Amongst, 65 were forecasted for the first time. Most potato miRNA families have one to three members, while miR474 has four.

abstract={In RFID system, because a collision occurs while a reader attempts to identify multiple tags at the same time, the anti-collision algorithm is necessary. This paper uses the tree based algorithm expressed in the form of a B-ary tree, in which the time required to identify all tags varies according to the value of B(Bges2). An increase in the value of B will decrease the number of collision cycles, while increasing the number of idle cycles. In order to solve this problem in previous algorithms, an improved 4-ary query tree algorithm (I4QTA) is suggested. If a collision occurs, the I4QTA uses the bits change method (BCM) to remove idle cycles by only detecting the tag IDs that actually exist. In other words, it can quickly identify all tags by reducing the number of query-responses.},

Then these single prediction results produced by these single intelligent predictors are fuzzified into some fuzzy prediction representations. Particularly, some methods of fuzzification are extended into a consolidated framework to make the later computation generalization. Subsequently, these fuzzified prediction representations are integrated into a fuzzy consensus, i.e., aggregated fuzzy prediction. Finally, the aggregated fuzzy prediction is defuzzified into a crisp value as the final prediction results. For verification and testing purposes, two typical oil price series are used to conduct the experiments.},

This understanding includes, among other tasks, automatically generating and maintaining models of human actions, goals and plans. This paper presents a system to infer the actions that people perform in order to accomplish activities of daily living starting from sensory inputs. Our approach is based on using relational learning to infer predictions about which action has just been executed. We learn a model for recognizing executed actions based on the state changes detected from sensor readings. Each change has been produced by a performed action, while a sequence of these actions forms a plan to accomplish a high-level action or to achieve a goal. Using a relational learning tool, Tilde, we obtain classifiers to map changes in the states to actions performed by a user. We have performed some experiments using an environment simulator feeded by data gathered from real human behaviour. The results show that we can obtain a good accuracy even in presence of noise.},

abstract={This paper studies the effect of automatic sentence boundary detection and comma prediction on entity and relation extraction in speech. We show that punctuating the machine generated transcript according to maximum F-measure of period and comma annotation results in suboptimal information extraction. Precisely, period and comma decision thresholds can be chosen in order to improve the entity value score and the relation value score by 4% relative. Error analysis shows that preventing noun-phrase splitting by generating longer sentences and fewer commas can be harmful for IE performance. Indeed, it seems that missed punctuation allows syntactic parsers to merge noun-phrases and prevent the extraction of correct information.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of e-business, Web sites are increasingly relying on dynamic content generation applications to provide dynamic interaction and personalized experiences to the Web sites users. To generate such dynamic Web page for each user request requires heavy dynamic script execution due to customize and personalize information. This dynamic script execution puts heavy load on the Web server. Again database server experiences extra overheads due to increase of database-driven e-commerce applications and their frequently update. These extra loads on Web server and database server lead to increase response time. The overall response time is made up of two types of latency, namely network latency and server-side latency. In this paper we are mainly concerned about server-side latency. We have proposed an approach which integrates prediction based dynamic Web page pre-generation with PFC and DBC caching. Our integrated approach reduces dynamic Web page generation time by achieving the eventual benefits through middle-tier database cache (DBC) and HTML fragment cache(PFC) and the immediate benefit through dynamic Web page pre-generation. Response time is reduced by storing database tables in the middle-tier cache and by sharing common fragments among multiple pages stored in the HTML fragment cache. The reduction of response time latency significantly improves the performance and scalability},

year={2006},
pages={191-196},
abstract={"Tail-splitting" is a new technique to identify defect prone modules by enhancing the focus of the Pareto distribution by a development process factor. The simple yet powerful influence of a varying tail membership as a function of development process phases is captured by the tail-split-string which tags each module. The case studies on an operating systems product demonstrate that the tail-split-string identifies a small set of modules with a high probability of field failure. The tail-boundary in the algorithm provides for a natural tuning parameter to control the size of the identified set to suit the resources available for rework. Release managers have found that the method is particularly useful to sift modules, with low false positive, for late stage rework},

year={2005},
pages={89-94},
abstract={As one of mobile agent applications, many systems which provide continuous service for users moving on a network have been proposed. In these systems, because a movement of mobile agents is performed after a user movement, users must wait for arrival of mobile agents. To reduce users' waiting time, we propose a fundamental framework for mobile agent systems where an agent can move precedently before a user movement, in our framework, it is assumed that computers are connected on a network and users with rewritable devices move on the network. The framework supports precedent movement of mobile agents based on prediction using movement history of users. Because the prediction may be wrong, the framework also provides the following movement of mobile agents. Moreover, the framework provides a recovery method of mobile agents in service in case that mobile agents disappear due to problems such as their bugs. Because we provide some APIs, via which various functions of our framework are accessed, developers of mobile agent systems can easily use our framework using the APIs. We implemented an experimental agent system using the APIs and confirmed that the framework performed correctly using the experimental system},

In contrast with previous approaches that predict the way and have two types of hits (primary of one cycle and secondary of two to four cycles), all hits of the difference-bit cache are of one cycle. The evaluation of the access time of our cache organization has been performed using a recently proposed on-chip cache access model.},

We develop an approach to automatically learn a sequence labeling model from a limited amount of labeled training examples and some amount of unlabeled data using conditional random fields. Our approach consists of two phases. The objective of the first phase is to choose some useful unlabeled data based on the assigned labels and the prediction probabilities of the current learned model. The useful unlabeled data is then analyzed in the second phase using a classification method. This classification method is to classify the incorrectly labeled states of the useful labeled data by considering their observation and the labels assigned by the current conditional random fields model. The useful unlabeled data is then exploited to improve the learning. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The efficiency of the approaches is compared in terms of time required to locate the first target and the average time to locate the targets that were found. Our initial experiments revealed interference among the robots, the targets and the obstacles. The effect of this interference was larger than expected},

We propose a new method for process assignment to processors by using the predicted time of execution as the parameter that decides the assignment. This execution time is predicted by means of a neural network. We have designed a new architecture with a self organizing map as a hidden nodes selector for a back propagation network in our design. The SOM takes the process characteristics as input and classifies the process. A back propagation network is used to predict the execution time taking the system characteristics as input and the nodes in the network are chosen by the winning neuron in the SOM classifier. The structure of the back propagation network is determined by which neuron wins in the SOM (process classifier). We have simulated this and have found that our model has been accurate in predicting execution time.},

Candidate features related to prosodic phrasing were extracted from the corpus to establish an example database. Based on this, a series of comparative experiments is conducted to collect the most effective features from the candidates. Two typical rule learning algorithms (C4.5 and TBL) were applied on the example database to induce prediction rules. To compare the results with others, the general evaluation parameters were introduced in the paper. With these parameters, the methods were compared to RNN and bigram based methods. Results show that the rule-learning approach introduced here can achieve better prediction accuracy than the nonrule based methods and yet retain the advantage of the simplicity and understandability.},

abstract={Image based finite element (FE) analysis was used to determine the deformation of the left ventricle (LV) between end-systole and end-diastole. The algorithm used volumetric MRI data to create a body force that deformed a finite element model of the LV over half of the cardiac cycle and tracked the tissue deformation. The accuracy of the computational predictions of strain were assessed by the creation of image data sets for which displacements between the images were known. A "forward" left ventricular FE model was given physiological loading and material properties. A loaded magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data set was created by displacing the end-systolic image MRI data set using the displacement values determined from the forward model. The strains computed from the forward and Warping solutions were compared. Further, PET images from a single patient were analyzed and compared to MRI-based Warping analysis results for the same patient at mid-ventricle and at the base of the LV. The fiber stretch distribution between the forward and warping solutions show good agreement, both in overall stretch distribution and for the stretch values on the image planes. The MRI and PET analyses showed similar stretch distributions indicating that strain distributions can be measured from PET images.},

abstract={Memory performance is increasingly determining microprocessor performance and technology trends are exacerbating this problem. Most architectures use set-associative caches with LRU replacement policies to combine fast access with relatively low miss rates. To improve replacement decisions in set-associative caches, we develop a new set of compiler algorithms that predict which data will and will not be reused and provide these hints to the architecture. We prove that the hints either match or improve hit rates over LRU. We describe a practical one-bit cache-line tag implementation of our algorithm, called evict-me. On a cache replacement, the architecture will replace a line for which the evict-me bit is set, or if none is set, it will use the LRU bits. We implement our compiler analysis and its output in the Scale compiler. On a variety of scientific programs, using the evict-me algorithm in both the level 1 and 2 caches improves simulated cycle times by up to 34% over the LRU policy by increasing hit rates. In addition, a combination of simple hardware prefetching and evict-me works together to further improve performance.},

Tracking accuracy is a critical characteristic of any proposed system concept and is the focus of the analysis discussed in this paper. Methods for determining whether or not a particular system concept can produce tracking accuracies sufficient to meet the requirements for the anticipated applications must be developed. This paper describes a high level, end-to-end error budget analysis approach for statistically quantifying tracking errors at the end user. The approach uses Monte Carlo techniques to provide quantifiable statistical results that can be used for performance prediction, requirement refinement, and error budget allocation. The paper also discusses the need to carefully develop and articulate the track accuracy requirements for applications so that a system concept evaluation can be completed. An example analysis for the SF-21 Enhanced Visual Acquisition application using TIS-B illustrates this approach and how it can be extended to the development of other SF-21 applications.},

abstract={Our research addresses the supervised learning problem. Informally stated, the supervised learning problem is defined as follows: given a class-tagged training dataset (e.g. a set of vectors with accompanying class tags), construct a classifier which given an untagged vector will predict its class membership. The classifier performance is measured in terms of the generalization ability, the capacity to correctly classify untagged samples. Supervised learning techniques are applicable to a wide range of engineering problems. Speech recognition, handwritten character recognition, medical diagnostics and data mining tasks are among the more obvious candidate problems for supervised learning strategies. Early efforts toward solving the supervised learning problem included linear methods such as the least squares linear classifier, the Fisher linear discriminant, and perceptron learning algorithms. These approaches shared an inherent inflexibility owing to their linear nature. Advances in available computer speed and storage capacity have sparked a renewed interest in supervised learning, witnessed by a wide range of innovations. Notably, neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), and decision trees offer state-of-the-art, nonlinear classification performance. Boosting techniques, which aim to iteratively improve classification performance by redistributing each training sample's weight in the training phases, have been demonstrated to be very effective. Our contribution aims to devise algorithms that share the classical approaches' theoretical elegance and closed form analytic solution with the flexibility offered by modern nonlinear approaches. We generalize the linear decision boundaries offered by Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) algorithm using kernel functions. The primary design goals are: (i) the ability to naturally deal with data that is not linearly separable as algorithm does not require a user specified regularization parameter for penalizing misclassifications; and (ii) modest computational load, and by relying on matrix inversion, it is capable of handling very large training datasets},
