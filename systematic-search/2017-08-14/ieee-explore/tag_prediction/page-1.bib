abstract={In the past few years, social tags and tagging systems have gained large momentum for service categorizing and indexing content on the Web. Tags are used freely, which leads a random correspondence between the tags and the services, which affects the performance of the tag in the search and applications. We propose a novel scheme for tag predicting based on graph, aiming to automatically sort the tags associated with a given API services according to their relevance to the service content using the theory of random walk. Tag sorting is applied to tag predicting of Web service. We evaluate our methodology through experiment using open data set. Our results show that our approach really boosts the performances of tag predicting.},

abstract={Building feature extraction approaches that can effectively characterize natural environment sounds is challenging due to the dynamic nature. In this paper, we develop a framework for feature extraction and obtaining semantic inferences from such data. In particular, we propose a new pooling strategy for deep architectures, that can preserve the temporal dynamics in the resulting representation. By constructing an ensemble of semantic embeddings, we employ an l1-reconstruction based prediction algorithm for estimating the relevant tags. We evaluate our approach on challenging environmental sound recognition datasets, and show that the proposed features outperform traditional spectral features.},

abstract={In recent years, several methods have been proposed to exploit image context (such as location) that provides valuable cues complementary to the image content, i.e., image annotations and geotags have been shown to assist the prediction of each other. To exploit the useful interrelatedness between these two heterogeneous prediction tasks, we propose a new correlation guided structured sparse multi-task learning method. We utilize a joint classification and regression model to identify annotation-informative and geotag-relevant image features. We also introduce the tree-structured sparsity regularizations into multi-task learning to integrate the label correlations in multi-label image annotation. Finally we derive an efficient algorithm to optimize our non-smooth objective function. We demonstrate the performance of our method on three real-world geotagged multi-label image data sets for both semantic annotation and geotag prediction.},

abstract={One of the characteristics of tag prediction mechanisms is that, typically, all user models are constructed with the same granularity. In this paper we hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that in order to increase tag prediction accuracy, the granularity of each user model has to be adapted to the level of usage of each particular user. We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

abstract={We present a method that automatically evaluates emotional response from spontaneous facial activity. The automatic evaluation of emotional response, or affect, is a fascinating challenge with many applications. Our approach is based on the inferred activity of facial muscles over time, as automatically obtained from an RGB-D video recording of spontaneous facial activity. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we constructed a database of publicly available short video clips, which elicit a strong emotional response in a consistent manner across different individuals. Each video was tagged by its characteristic emotional response along 4 scales: Valence, Arousal, Likability and Rewatch (the desire to watch again). The second contribution is a two-step prediction method, based on learning, which was trained and tested using this database of tagged video clips. Our method was able to successfully predict the aforementioned 4 dimensional representation of affect, achieving high correlation (0.87-0.95) between the predicted scores and the affect tags. As part of the prediction algorithm we identified the period of strongest emotional response in the viewing recordings, in a method that was blind to the video clip being watched, showing high agreement between independent viewers. Finally, inspection of the relative contribution of different feature types to the prediction process revealed that temporal facets contributed more to the prediction of individual affect than to media tags.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet, more and more people use social networks to share information and express their views, which lead to a vigorous growth of information. How to select useful and interesting information for users, that is user topic interest, gets more and more attention. Tag functionality in microblog can get user topic interests easily and achieve information recommendation effectively. To deal with the situation that there are few or no tags for most users in microblog, a user topic interest prediction method based on the tag content and interactive relations of users is proposed. The method utilizes Wikipedia to extend the tags and produce a preliminary estimate of the tags' importance. What's more, interactive relations and propagation analysis of different tags are studied. An extensive empirical study using real Sina Microblog data clearly demonstrates that our method has a better performance in user topic interest prediction.},

title={Efficacy of Season Prediction for Geo-locations Using Geo-tagged Images},
year={2015},
pages={476-484},
abstract={Tens of thousands of pictures are taken at different locations throughout the year. People often visit places and take pictures to remember their visits. We believe that the seasonal travel patterns of people to specific locations will create a correlation between a location and the season of the images taken in that location. For example, fewer people visit Bear Valley, California during the summer than during the winter as it is a popular Ski Resort. Therefore, we believe we will find more pictures of Bear Valley taken during winter when compared to any other seasons. Today, most of the photographs have geo-location (Latitude and Longitude) and time when the photograph was taken included in their metadata. Given the distribution of photographs, correlations between locations and seasons found using this metadata could potentially be used to develop a system to predict the best time of year to visit particular locations or number of people who may visit a tourist destination in the next season allowing business establishments to prepare appropriately. In this work we evaluate the efficacy of using this metadata to predict the season given the location. In our work, using a dataset comprised of photograph metadata, we focused on approximately 1.1 million photographs taken in California. Using variations of the nearest neighbor algorithm, we were able to predict the season of a photograph with a maximum correctness of 80.9% with a sufficiently large training set. We experimented with both weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Fixed Radius Nearest Neighbor (FRNN) using no-weight, inverse, logarithmic, and gaussian weight calculators. Using the K-NN model, we found that logarithmic weighted K-NN performed the best at 79.55% correctness. Using the Fixed Radius NN model, we found that the gaussian weighted model using standard deviation of 0.0001 performed the best at 80.9%.},

abstract={A silicon optical switching has been applied to design a reconfigurable spiral resonator to be used in RFID chipless tags. The incidence of suitable wavelength light on the switching changes from conductive to dielectric its electrical properties. A multiresonator has an owner spectral signature defined by a set of bits 0 and 1 from each single resonator. In this work, the state of each resonator can be at resonance or non-resonance according to the optical switching allowing the reconfiguration of the whole system. Therefore, the reconfiguration based on optical switching can be performed many times allowing us to increase the number of access state of the tag. The approach is shown through a theoretical model for the characterization of silicon substrate behavior on light incidence. The validation of the system operation is performed using electromagnetic simulations in HFSS.},

abstract={The development of social media has led to a burst of interest in image-related metadata information, such as tags and geo-tags. Tags are semantic keywords that are assigned to an image. Image tagging enables the users of social media sharing platforms to annotate images, facilitating image search and content description. Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes. Experiments on a dataset crawled from Flickr demonstrate F1 at 10 top ranked tags equal to 0.558 for image tagging and cumulative geotagging prediction rate at 3 top ranks equal to 83%.},

Although tag co-occurrence has recently become a hot research topic, many studies mainly focus on how to produce the personalized recommendation leveraging the tag co-occurrence relationship and most of them are considered in a homogeneous network. So far, few studies pay attention to how to predict tag co-occurrence relationship across heterogeneous networks. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel two-step prediction approach. First, weight path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-occurrence relationships. Experiments are performed on real-world dataset, the Flickr network, with comprehensive measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that weight path-based heterogeneous topological features have substantial advantages over commonly used link prediction approaches in predicting co-occurrence relations in information networks.},

abstract={Efficient detection of RFID-tagged physical objects is one of the key enabling technologies to build pervasive Internet-of-Things applications. However, the detection of tagged-objects is faced with the critical challenge of tag dynamics, which mainly arises from the movement of tagged physical objects. To capture tag dynamics, the application needs to detect the presence/absence of tags in an accurate, timely and cost-effective way. To address these challenges, we propose the Prediction of Tag Dynamics (PTD) algorithm. PTD achieves runtime detection of tagged-objects by i) streaming of the temporally-correlated tag readings obtained from persistent tracking of the tagged-object, and ii) runtime prediction of tag dynamics based on the streaming of tag readings. The performance of PTD is investigated based on real implementation and experimental evaluation, where PTD processes tag readings gathered with high fidelity from persistent tracking of real activities of tagged objects. The evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy, timeliness and cost-effectiveness of PTD.},

abstract={The power law distribution of social tag frequency is one of the most important statistic characteristics in social tagging system. Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

The tremendous growth of users require the recommender system to produce tag recommendations for millions of users and items at any minute. The triplets of users, items and tags are most naturally described by a 3D tensor, and tensor decomposition-based algorithms can produce high quality recommendations. However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, Para Fac, and Low-order tensor decompositions.

The proposed intelligent method is capable of saving time and costs by quick prediction of tag detection.

abstract={Radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers are powered RF devices that communicate with tags (whether mobile or fixed) and read necessary information to be processed. A mobile RFID tag is detected by an RFID antenna. In a mobile RFID where the RFID tag is attached to a mobile object such as a vehicle, a human, or an animal, information is more difficult to detect than in the case where the tag is attached to a stationary object. Currently, deployment engineers and researchers use trial-and-error approaches to decide on the best conditions of the tag detection influence factors which affect tag detectability (detection rate). As expected, these approaches are time consuming. Even though mobile RFID systems have become widely used in industry and tag detection problems are crucial at deployment, very few researches on them have been conducted so far. Thus, a quick and simple method for finding tag detectability is needed to improve the traditional time consuming trial-and-error method. In this paper, we propose a unique approach ldquothe intelligent prediction method of tag detection rate using support vector machine (SVM).rdquo The intelligent method predicts the mobile RFID tag detectability instead of the trial-and-error experimental procedures. The simulation results of the proposed method are very comparable to the trial-and-error experimental approach. The proposed intelligent method gives a very high accuracy of mobile RFID tag detectability prediction and proves to be superior to the current method in time as well cost savings. The predicted tag detectability results can be used for analyzing mobile RFID tag detection influence factors and their conditions.},

abstract={Due to the tremendous number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), there is a clear need to expedite genotyping by considering only a subset of all SNPs called haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs). Recently, the approach that selects htSNPs by maximizing their prediction accuracy has demonstrated very promising results. Here we propose a new prediction system for htSNP selection based on neural network models. We applied our system to three public data sets, and compared its prediction performance to that of two state-of-the-art prediction rules. The results demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms compared methods with robust performance.},

abstract={RFID Tag detection/recognition is one of the most critical issues for successful deployment of RFID systems in diverse applications. The main factors influencing tag detection by RFID reader antenna include tag position, relative position of reader, read field length, etc. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of tag detection for a carton box object on a wooden pallet by an experimental approach based on tag signal strength, and we propose a method for predicting detection related directly to the strength of tag signal using an intelligent machine learning technique called support vector machine (SVM). The use of the proposed method is able to save time and cost by quick prediction of tag detection. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed approach can predict tag recognition for a carton box object with an accuracy at 95% for various reader heights and read field lengths. The proposed approach is effective for determining the best tag detection influencing factor conditioned on the target object with the help of detectability prediction.},

abstract={The launch of Xbox Kinect has built a very successful computer vision product and made a big impact on the gaming industry. This sheds lights onto a wide variety of potential applications related to action recognition. The accurate estimation of human poses from the depth image is universally a critical step. However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when facing severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within a specific human action domain. Furthermore, as an extension, we learn a conditional model by incorporation of pose tags to further increase the accuracy of pose correction. In the experiments, significant improvements on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction are observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system. Our experiments for the facial landmark correction also illustrate that our algorithm can improve the accuracy of other detection/estimation systems.},

title={PROMPT: Personalized User Tag Recommendation for Social Media Photos Leveraging Personal and Social Contexts},
year={2016},
pages={486-492},
abstract={Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

abstract={Image annotation, or prediction of multiple tags for an image, is a challenging task. Most current algorithms are based on large sets of handcrafted features. Deep convolutional neural networks have recently outperformed humans in image classification, and these networks can be used to extract features highly predictive of an image's tags. In this study, we analyze semantic information in features derived from two pre-trained deep network classifiers by evaluating their performance in nearest neighbor-based approaches to tag prediction. We generally exceed performance of the manual features when using the deep features. We also find complementary information in the manual and deep features when used in combination for image annotation.},

abstract={Community bulletin boards serve an important function for public information sharing in modern society. Posted fliers advertise services, events, and other announcements. However, fliers posted offline suffer from problems such as limited spatial-temporal coverage and inefficient search support. In recent years, with the development of sensor-enhanced mobile devices, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been used in a variety of application areas. This paper presents FlierMeet, a crowd-powered sensing system for cross-space public information reposting, tagging, and sharing. The tags learned are useful for flier sharing and preferred information retrieval and suggestion. Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts. To evaluate our system, 38 participants were recruited and 2,035 reposts were captured during an eight-week period. Experiments on this dataset showed that our approach to flier grouping is effective and the proposed features are useful for flier category/semantic tagging.},

title={Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation},
year={2013},
pages={438-447},
abstract={In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks. Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost.},

abstract={Concept labeling and ontology-free tagging are the two typical manners of image annotation. Despite extensive research efforts have been dedicated to labeling, currently automatic image labeling algorithms are still far from satisfactory, and meanwhile manual labeling is rather labor-intensive. In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity. Experiments are conducted on different datasets and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Kernel smoothing and collaborative filtering techniques are explored for improving the accuracy of the probabilistic models estimation. By comparing with some state-of-the-art content-based image labeling methods, we have empirically shown that 1) the proposed method can achieve comparable tag prediction accuracy when there is no user-provided tag, and that 2) it can significantly boost the prediction accuracy if the user can provide just a few tags.},

To solve this problem, we propose a 5-way multi-class classifier system. The results obtained by this classification scheme are discussed, by analysing certain score metrics of the classifier system. Competitive results were obtained by the 5-way classifier system, obtaining F1 scores ranging from 0.59 to 0.76.

year={2009},
pages={309-316},
abstract={Image auto-annotation is an important open problem in computer vision. For this task we propose TagProp, a discriminatively trained nearest neighbor model. Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

title={Fast and Reliable Tag Estimation in RFID Systems with Collision-Oblivious Reader},
year={2009},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Many RFID systems use dynamic slotted ALOHA to identify the label information of the RFID tags. One of the key problems in the RFID system is how to estimate the number of RFID tags up to the desired level of accuracy. In this paper, we present the framework of tag estimation algorithm for the collision-oblivious (CO) reader which can only decide whether the tag response is successful or not. Thus, the CO reader must rely on the success estimator to predict the RFID tag population. We propose two estimation algorithms to predict the number of RFID tags, named the memoryless success estimator (MSE) and the intersection-based success estimator (ISE). The MSE considers only the estimate obtained at the current inventory round, while the ISE finds an appropriate intersection interval of the existing estimates collected at every inventory round. Through the simulation results, we demonstrate that the ISE is a fast, accurate, and controllable estimator whose performance is close to that of the collision/idle estimators.},

abstract={Image representation learning is a fundamental problem in understanding semantics of images. However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

abstract={With an increasing number of images that are available in social media, image annotation has emerged as an important research topic due to its application in image matching and retrieval. Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

abstract={Visualizing audio signals during playback has long been a fundamental function of music players. However, most visual effects are generated by audio signal processing directly and render meaningless or incomprehensible displays to users. In this paper, we present an intelligent music player called the Playing with Tagging (PWT) music player. By integrating a real-time music tagger, the PWT player can display dynamic tag distributions via a set of tag bars that move in sync with the music. To synchronize the tag distributions, the music tagger must be able to online recognize the music tags. We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played. To evaluate the real-time tagging function, we simulate tag prediction on short music chunks. The results of experiments on the MajorMiner dataset demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed music tagging method.},

The latent sub-tag information is exploited in our framework to assist the learning of our end goal, i.e., tag prediction. We use the cowatch information to initialize the learning process.

year={2009},

abstract={Online social networking sites such as Flickr and Facebook provide a diverse range of functionalities that foster online communities to create and share media content. In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

year={2008},

abstract={Bloom Filters are a technique to reduce the effects of conflicts/interference in hash table-like structures. Conventional hash tables store information in a single location which is susceptible to destructive interference through hash conflicts. A Bloom Filter uses multiple hash functions to store information in several locations, and recombines the information through some voting mechanism. Many microarchitectural predictors use simple single-index hash tables to make binary 0/1 predictions, and Bloom Filters help improve predictor accuracy. However, implementing a true Bloom Filter requires k hash functions, which in turn implies a k-ported hash table, or k sequential accesses. Unfortunately,the area of a hardware table increases quadratically with the port count, increasing costs of area, latency and power consumption. We propose a simple but elegant modification to the Bloom Filter algorithm that uses banking combined with special hash functions that guarantee all hash indexes fall into non-conflicting banks. We evaluate several applications of our Banked Bloom Filter (BBF) prediction in processors: BBF branch prediction, BBF load hit/miss prediction, and BBF last-tag prediction. We show that BBF predictors can provide accurate predictions with substantially less cost than previous techniques.},

abstract={A branch target buffer (BTB) can reduce the performance penalty of branches in pipelined processors by predicting the path of the branch and caching information used by the branch. Two major issues in the design of BTBs that achieves maximum performance with a limited number of bits allocated to the BTB implementation are discussed. The first is BTB management. A method for discarding branches from the BTB is examined. This method discards the branch with the smallest expected value for improving performance; it outperforms the least recently used (LRU) strategy by a small margin, at the cost of additional complexity. The second issue is the question of what information to store in the BTB. A BTB entry can consist of one or more of the following: branch tag, prediction information, the branch target address, and instructions at the branch target. Various BTB designs, with one or more of these fields, are evaluated and compared},

year={2017},
volume={11},

pages={754-764},
abstract={Machine learning (ML) models and algorithms can enable a personalized learning experience for students in an inexpensive and scalable manner. At the heart of ML-driven personalized learning is the automated analysis of student responses to assessment items. Existing statistical models for this task enable the estimation of student knowledge and question difficulty solely from graded response data with only minimal effort from instructors. However, most existing student–response models are generalized linear models, meaning that they characterize the probability that a student answers a question correctly through a linear combination of their knowledge and the question's difficulty with respect to each concept that is being assessed. Such models cannot characterize complicated, nonlinear student–response associations and, hence, lack human interpretability in practice. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear student–response model called Boolean logic analysis (BLAh) that models a student's binary-valued graded response to a question as the output of a Boolean logic function. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm that learns the Boolean logic functions for each question solely from graded response data. A refined BLAh model improves the identifiability, tractability, and interpretability by considering a restricted set of ordered Boolean logic functions. Experimental results on a variety of real-world educational datasets demonstrate that BLAh not only achieves best-in-class prediction performance on unobserved student responses on some datasets but also provides easily interpretable parameters when questions are tagged with metadata by domain experts, which can provide useful feedback to instructors and content designers to improve the quality of assessment items.},

abstract={We present a novel corpus for automatic punctuation prediction in Persian texts. Punctuation prediction is an important task in automatic speech recognition (ASR). The output of ASR systems is typically a raw sequence of words with no punctuation marks; this makes the text difficult or even impossible to make sense of for humans and also for any text processing unit. In this work, we have assembled a state-of-the-art Persian corpus to train and test a punctuation prediction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever corpus specifically designed for punctuation prediction in Persian texts. The corpus is a modification of a manually part-of-speech (POS) tagged Persian one, with almost 2.6 million words, including punctuation marks. We have made many diligent improvements to the already existing corpus to make one that deliberately facilitates experimental studies on Persian punctuation prediction: 1- replacing 3175 word types with their correct form, 2- normalizing the words (e.g. replacing kashida with hyphen), 3- correcting 451 and 192 words with incorrect DELM and DEFAULT tags, respectively, 4- investigating 17 word types to correct the punctuations around them, and 5- making numerous corrections to the punctuation marks. The final corpus contains nearly 2.3 million words and 221 thousand punctuation marks. Finally, we have trained and tested a CRF (conditional random field) model that shows a micro-averaged F1-score of 60.69% in our preliminary experiments.},

abstract={Music auto-tagging is often handled in a similar manner to image classification by regarding the two-dimensional audio spectrogram as image data. However, music auto-tagging is distinguished from image classification in that the tags are highly diverse and have different levels of abstraction. Considering this issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we extract audio features from each layer of the pretrained convolutional networks separately and aggregate them altogether giving a long audio clip. Finally, we put them into fully connected networks and make final predictions of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the MagnaTagATune dataset and the Million Song Dataset. We further show that the proposed architecture is useful in transfer learning.},

Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

Another assumption about user generated tags is that the order of these tags provides no useful information for the prediction of tags on future images. We challenge the aforementioned assumptions, and provide a machine learning approach to the problem of personalized image tagging with the following contributions: 1.) We reformulate the personalized image tagging problem as a search/retrieval ranking problem, 2.) We leverage the order of tags, which does not always reflect visual relevance, provided by the user in the past as a cue to their tag preferences, similar to click data, 3.)

abstract={This study investigates whether taking genre into account is beneficial for automatic music mood annotation in terms of core affects valence, arousal, and tension, as well as several other mood scales. Novel techniques employing genre-adaptive semantic computing and audio-based modelling are proposed. A technique called the ACTwg employs genre-adaptive semantic computing of mood-related social tags, whereas ACTwg-SLPwg combines semantic computing and audio-based modelling, both in a genre-adaptive manner. The proposed techniques are experimentally evaluated at predicting listener ratings related to a set of 600 popular music tracks spanning multiple genres. The results show that ACTwg outperforms a semantic computing technique that does not exploit genre information, and ACTwg-SLPwg outperforms conventional techniques and other genre-adaptive alternatives. In particular, improvements in the prediction rates are obtained for the valence dimension which is typically the most challenging core affect dimension for audio-based annotation. The specificity of genre categories is not crucial for the performance of ACTwg-SLPwg. The study also presents analytical insights into inferring a concise tag-based genre representation for genre-adaptive music mood analysis.},

abstract={In this letter, the authors show that structured social media data can act as an accurate predictor for wireless data demand patterns at a high spatial-temporal resolution. A casestudy is performed on Greater London covering a 5000 km2 area. The data used includes over 0.6 million geo-tagged Twitter data, over 1 million mobile phone data demand records, and U.K. census data. The analysis shows that social media activity (Tweets/s n) can accurately predict the long-term traffic demand for both the uplink and downlink channels. The relationship between social media activity and traffic demand obeys a power law and the model explains for over 71%-79% of the variance in real traffic demand. This is a significant improvement over existing methods of long-term traffic prediction such as census population data (R2 = 0.57). The authors also show that social media data can also forward predict short-term traffic demand for up to 2 h on the same day and for the same time in the following 2-3 days.},

title={A Location- and Diversity-Aware News Feed System for Mobile Users},
year={2016},
volume={9},
number={6},
pages={846-861},
abstract={A location-aware news feed (LANF) system generates news feeds for a mobile user based on her spatial preference (i.e., her current location and future locations) and non-spatial preference (i.e., her interest). Existing LANF systems simply send the most relevant geo-tagged messages to their users. Unfortunately, the major limitation of such an existing approach is that, a news feed may contain messages related to the same location (i.e., point-of-interest) or the same category of locations (e.g., food, entertainment or sport). We argue that diversity is a very important feature for location-aware news feeds because it helps users discover new places and activities. In this paper, we propose D-MobiFeed; a new LANF system enables a user to specify the minimum number of message categories (h) for the messages in a news feed. In D-MobiFeed, our objective is to efficiently schedule news feeds for a mobile user at her current and predicted locations, such that (i) each news feed contains messages belonging to at least h different categories, and (ii) their total relevance to the user is maximized. To achieve this objective, we formulate the problem into two parts, namely, a decision problem and an optimization problem. For the decision problem, we provide an exact solution by modeling it as a maximum flow problem and proving its correctness. The optimization problem is solved by our proposed three-stage heuristic algorithm. We conduct a user study and experiments to evaluate the performance of D-MobiFeed using a real data set crawled from Foursquare. Experimental results show that our proposed three-stage heuristic scheduling algorithm outperforms the brute-force optimal algorithm by at least an order of magnitude in terms of running time and the relative error incurred by the heuristic algorithm is below 1 percent. D-MobiFeed with the location prediction method effectively improves the relevance, diversity, and efficiency of news feeds.},

abstract={With the availability of cheap location sensors, geotagging of images in online social media is very popular. With a large amount of geo-tagged social images, it is interesting to study how these images are shared across geographical regions and how the geographical language characteristics and vision patterns are distributed across different regions. Unlike textual document, geo-tagged social image contains multiple types of content, i.e., textual description, visual content, and geographical information. Existing approaches usually mine geographical characteristics using a subset of multiple types of image contents or combining those contents linearly, which ignore correlations between different types of contents, and their geographical distributions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method to discover geographical characteristics of geo-tagged social images using a geographical topic model called geographical topic model of social images (GTMSIs). GTMSI integrates multiple types of social image contents as well as the geographical distributions, in which image topics are modeled based on both vocabulary and visual features. In GTMSI, each region of the image would have its own topic distribution, and hence have its own language model and vision pattern. Experimental results show that our GTMSI could identify interesting topics and vision patterns, as well as provide location prediction and image tagging.},

pages={66-75},
abstract={A common trend in image-tagging research is to focus on visually relevant tags; however, this tends to ignore the personal and social aspects of tags, especially on photo blogging websites such as Flickr. Previous work has correctly identified that many of the tags that users provide on images are not visually relevant (that is, representative of the salient content in the image) and they go on to treat such tags as noise, ignoring the fact that the users chose to provide those tags over others that could have been more visually relevant. Another common assumption about user-generated tags for images is that the order of these tags provides no useful information for the prediction of tags on future images. This assumption also tends to define usefulness in terms of what is visually relevant to the image. For general tagging or labeling applications that focus on providing visual information about image content, these assumptions are reasonable, but when considering personalized image-tagging applications, these assumptions are at best too rigid, ignoring user choice and preferences. This article challenges these assumptions and provides a machine learning approach to the problem of personalized image tagging. The authors reformulate the personalized image-tagging problem as a search/retrieval ranking problem and leverage the order of tags provided by the user in the past as a cue to tag preferences, similar to click data. They propose a technique to augment sparse user tag data (semisupervision) and demonstrate the efficacy of this method on a subset of Flickr images.},

abstract={Punctuation plays an important role in language processing. However, automatic speech recognition systems only output plain word sequences. It is then of interest to predict punctuations on plain word sequences. Previous works have focused on using lexical features or prosodic cues captured from small corpus to predict simple punctuations. Compared with simple punctuations, rich punctuations provide more meaningful information and are more difficult to predict. In this paper, a multi-view LSTM model is proposed to predict rich punctuations on large-scale corpora. In particular, predictions on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets are investigated. Experiments showed that LSTM can significantly outperform the traditional CRF-based model. Moreover, large-scale corpora are proved to bring large progress, and introducing POS tags and Chunking information in a multi-view structure improves performance of LSTM model on small corpus.},

year={2016},
pages={847-852},
abstract={Image annotation is a hard multi-label learning problem which aims at automatically tagging each input image with relevant keywords reflecting its semantic concepts. Recently, several late fusion methods were proposed to improve the accuracy of image annotation. But these late fusion methods need normalization of confidence score vectors of independent models corresponding to distinct representations. Choosing a good normalization function is tricky and difficult. In this paper, we propose a new method of late fusion for image annotation based on rank minimization. The proposed method avoids normalization by transforming confidence score vectors into pairwise relationship matrices. And an optimal matrix is obtained by solving a minimization optimization problem. With the optimal matrix, a fused confidence score vector can be recovered, which gives the final prediction of tags. Experiments on standard Corel5K and our Campus-Indoor dataset confirm the effectiveness of our late fusion method for image annotation.},

abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations.},

year={2016},
pages={508-512},
abstract={In digital signal processors, set-associative caches achieve low miss rates for typical applications but result in significant power consumption. Set-associative caches decrease access time by probing all the data ways in parallel with the tag lookup, although the output of only the matching way is used. The power spent access the other ways is wasted. Eliminating the power consumption by performing the data lookup following the tag comparison definitely increase cache access time, and is unacceptable for high performance level 1 caches. In this paper we propose a way prediction method to reducing set-associative data cache dynamic power while maintaining high performance. This method predicts the matching way and only probes the predicted way, achieving power savings. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method in reducing level 1 data cache power consumption and the simulation results show that this proposed technique achieves a power reduction of up to 18.97% and 14.70% on average, respectively, with negligible area overheads.},

abstract={Automatic image annotation has drawn much attention in the last two decades due to its application in social images organization. Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

year={2013},
pages={49-61},
abstract={First level caches are performance-critical and are therefore optimized for speed. To do so, modern processors reduce the miss ratio by using set-associative caches and optimize latency by reading all ways in parallel with the TLB and tag lookup. However, this wastes energy since only data from one way is actually used. To reduce energy, phased-caches and way-prediction techniques have been proposed wherein only data of the matching/predicted way is read. These optimizations increase latency and complexity, making them less attractive for first level caches. Instead of adding new functionality on top of a traditional cache, we propose a new cache design that adds way index information to the TLB. This allow us to: 1) eliminate extra data array reads (by reading the right way directly), 2) avoid tag comparisons (by eliminating the tag array), 3) filter out misses (by checking the TLB), and 4) amortize the TLB lookup energy (by integrating it with the way information). In addition, the new cache can directly replace existing caches without any modification to the processor core or software. This new Tag-Less Cache (TLC) reduces the dynamic energy for a 32 kB, 8-way cache by 78% compared to a VIPT cache without affecting performance.},

pages={3529-3538},
abstract={Mining useful knowledge from data readily available in today's information systems has been a common challenge in recent years as more and more events are being recorded, and there is need to improve and support many organisational processes in a competitive and rapidly changing environments. The work in this paper shows using a case study of Learning Process - how data from various process domains can be extracted, semantically prepared, and transformed into mining executable formats to support the discovery, monitoring and enhancement of real-time processes. In so doing, it enables the prediction of individual patterns/behaviour through further semantic analysis of the discovered models. Our aim is to extract streams of event logs from a learning execution environment and describe formats that allows for mining and improved process analysis of the captured data. The approach involves augmenting the informative value of the resulting model derived from mining event data about the process by semantically annotating the process elements with concepts they represent in real time using process descriptions languages, and linking them to an ontology specifically designed for representing learning processes to allow for the analysis of the extracted event logs based on concepts rather than the event tags of the process. The semantic analysis allows the meaning of the learning object properties and model to be enhanced through the use of property characteristics and classification of discoverable entities, to generate inference knowledge which are then used to determine useful learning patterns by means of the proposed Semantic Learning Process Mining (SLPM) formalization - described technically as Semantic-Fuzzy Miner. As a result, the approach provides us with the capability to infer new and discover hidden relationships/attributes the process instances share amongst themselves within the knowledge base, and the ability to identify and address the problem of determini- g the presence of different learning patterns or behaviour. Inference knowledge discovered due to semantic enrichment of the process model is advantageous especially in solving some didactic issues and answering some questions with regards to different Learners behaviour within the context of process mining and semantic model analysis. To this end, we show that information derived from process mining algorithms can be improved by adding semantic knowledge to the resulting model.},

abstract={A podcast combines the liveliness of a FM radio channel with the economy of Internet blog posting. They are especially convenient for scenarios when there is limited internet ability and connectivity for example in the car, the gym, etc. While both the volume and heterogeneity of content is huge it becomes operationally difficult to manually categorize or tag these audio items, thus manage them in a system for users to discover. Furthermore, due to the incompleteness of audio associated meta data there are not enough features for a typical recommender system to learn the item similarities thus make recommendations. In this paper we propose and examine a novel approach to generate latent embeddings for podcast items utilizing the aggregated information from all the text-based features associated with the audioitems. These embeddings that are generated using well established Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the podcast items can be used to measure or indicate the content similarity among the various podcast items. Both GPU (CUDA) and CPU computing architectures are experimented and bench marked for the model training, cross-validation of the content predictions on large scale datasets.},

title={Measuring and Predicting Tag Importance for Image Retrieval},

volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-1},
abstract={Textual data such as tags, sentence descriptions are combined with visual cues to reduce the semantic gap for image retrieval applications in today’s Multimodal Image Retrieval (MIR) systems. However, all tags are treated as equally important in these systems, which may result in misalignment between visual and textual modalities during MIR training. This will further lead to degenerated retrieval performance at query time. To address this issue, we investigate the problem of tag importance prediction, where the goal is to automatically predict the tag importance and use it in image retrieval. To achieve this, we first propose a method to measure the relative importance of object and scene tags from image sentence descriptions. Using this as the ground truth, we present a tag importance prediction model to jointly exploit visual, semantic and context cues. The Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM) formulation is adopted to ensure efficient training of the prediction model. Then, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is employed to learn the relation between the image visual feature and tag importance to obtain robust retrieval performance. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show a significant performance improvement of the proposed MIR with Tag Importance Prediction (MIR/TIP) system over other MIR systems.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a method for point of interest (POI) recommendation by extracting the multi-tag influence and modeling the geographical influence. First of all, we extract a user-tag matrix from the initial user-POI rating matrix by analyzing the relations between POI and the related bag of tags. Secondly, we use the probabilistic factor model to predict the missing data of the extracted matrix. Thirdly, an effective method to model the geographical influence is proposed by considering the location of user and POI and the related region center. Finally, the multi-tag and geographical influence are fused in the process of making prediction of missing value of every POI. Then we will get a great result for POI recommendation. The experimental analysis on the large dataset Yelp demonstrates that our method outperform the state-of-art methods.},

abstract={Sentiment prediction from visual content is a challenge due to the difficulty of inferring sentiment directly from the low-level visual features. Most recent researches use Adjective Noun Pairs (ANPs) as a middle level to narrow the gap between vision and sentiment. While as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is going deeper, it is becoming possible to implement rather complex mappings. In this paper, an image dataset with sentiment tags is built for training. We conduct the experiment by training 15,000 scene images on three different CNNs models, proving that deep learning can perform rather well on specific sentiment prediction task. CNNs models are also more concise and easy than those using ANPs in the aspect of data collection and engineering implementation.},

pages={195-200},
abstract={Big Data consists of huge volume of complex growing data sets from several independent sources. With the rapid development of data collection and storage capacity, big data are expanding in all science and engineering domains. The most fundamental challenge for big data applications is to scrutinize the large amount of data and extract required information or knowledge for future usage which is beyond the limit of relational databases with respect to storage and processing of massive quantity of data. Intent of this paper is by considering the big data repository as Twitter, dynamically mine the recent tweets related to Kapoor and Sons movie and perform the data mining operation and analytics on it by overcoming the challenges categorized with respect to the HACE theorem. To handle the massive amount of tweets we have used Hadoop Map Reduce framework to perform data mining analytic operations such as data cleansing, data classification and data clustering. Prediction model for the movie review is built by using Naive Bayes Classifier and accuracy of the prediction is calculated with the help of binomial test as it conforms to the Bernoulli distribution. Clustering of Tweets are obtained on the basis of Location and Hash Tags. Additionally privacy for the user tweets are preserved by using Data mining anomaly Technique, results are displayed with the help of intelligent graphs. As a Performance Evaluation of Map Reduce, the predictive analysis is done by using Map Reduce as well as without using Map Reduce, based on the execution time comparison performance graph is obtained to prove Map Reduce is an Efficient framework for huge volume of data.},

pages={3784-3791},
abstract={Multi-label classification (MLC) is a supervised learning problem in which a particular example can be associated with a set of labels instead of a single one as in traditional classification. Many real-world applications, such as Web page classification or resource tagging on the Social Web, are challenging for existing MLC algorithms, because the label space grows exponentially as instance space increases. Under the problem transformation approach, the most common alternative for MLC, multi-label problems are transformed into several single label problems, whose outputs are then aggregated into a prediction to the whole classification problem. Feature selection techniques become crucial in large-scale MLC problems to help reducing dimensionality. However, the impact of feature selection in multi-label setting has not been as extensively studied as in the case of single-label data. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of feature selection techniques in the context of the three main problem transformation MLC methods: Binary Relevance, Pair-wise and Label power-set. Experimentation was performed across a number of benchmark datasets for multi-label classification exhibiting varied characteristics, which allows observing the behavior of techniques and assessing their impact according to multiple metrics.},

pages={6005-6013},
abstract={Pointwise label and pairwise label are both widely used in computer vision tasks. For example, supervised image classification and annotation approaches use pointwise label, while attribute-based image relative learning often adopts pairwise labels. These two types of labels are often considered independently and most existing efforts utilize them separately. However, pointwise labels in image classification and tag annotation are inherently related to the pairwise labels. For example, an image labeled with "coast" and annotated with "beach, sea, sand, sky" is more likely to have a higher ranking score in terms of the attribute "open", while "men shoes" ranked highly on the attribute "formal" are likely to be annotated with "leather, lace up" than "buckle, fabric". The existence of potential relations between pointwise labels and pairwise labels motivates us to fuse them together for jointly addressing related vision tasks. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between class labels, tags and attributes, and propose a novel framework PPP(Pointwise and Pairwise image label Prediction), which is based on overlapped group structure extracted from the pointwise-pairwise-label bipartite graph. With experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance on three vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, users' social media activities, such as tweets sent, do not always reveal their location. We consider the problem of estimating geo-tags for tweets and develop a comprehensive approach that incorporates textual content, the user's personalized behavior, and the user's social relationships. Our approach, Percimo, considers the two major kinds of communal attachment, which have distinct computational ramifications. We evaluate Percimo via three geo-social graphs based on the mutual-follow relationships of Twitter users, their geographical distance (computed from their geotagged tweets), and their preferences for location categories (collected from Foursquare). We find that Percimo yields a smaller prediction error than the two state-of-the-art approaches we compare with.},

abstract={Road traffic congestion is one of the problems in large cities. While Twitter has become a major means for communication and message dissemination among Internet users, one question that arises is whether Twitter messages alone can suggest road traffic congestion condition. This paper proposes a method to predict traffic congestion severity level based on the analysis of Twitter messages. Different types of tweets data are used to construct a C4.5 decision tree model for prediction, including tweets from selected road-traffic Twitter accounts, tweets that contain road-traffic-related keywords, and geo-tagged tweets whose volume suggests large crowds in certain areas. In the training that used tweets data of one of the top congested roads in Bangkok, density of tweets has high information gain in classifying congestion severity level. Via a web application, the model can provide a traveler with an estimate of the congestion severity level of the road at every 30 minutes. Such advance congestion information can help the traveler to make a better travel plan. In an evaluation using 10-fold cross validation, the model also shows good performance.},

title={Auto-annotation of tomato images based on ripeness and firmness classification for multimodal retrieval},
year={2016},
pages={1084-1091},
abstract={An interesting application of machine vision is quality estimation of tomatoes. Here, there is extensive availability of images that needs to be retrieved in an effective and efficient manner. In this paper, a classification based auto annotation (CBA) of tomato images for providing semantic tags is proposed. These tags are derived from their content-based learning. Semantic tags are deduced from the classification of tomatoes on two most important quality parameters i.e. ripeness and firmness. For firmness estimation, an approach is proposed that exploits three texture feature extraction algorithms: two are based on statistical techniques viz. first order statistics (FOS), and, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and one is based on transform-based technique viz. wavelet-transform. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis has been used to establish the relationship between the instrumental firmness and texture values obtained from texture analysis. Prediction models for three texture feature sets are built, compared, and tested for over fitting using double cross-validation method. Based on the firmness of tomatoes, which is estimated through digital color imaging technique, they are classified into three classes soft, medium, and hard. To select a classifier for CBA, experiments with five learning methods, Naïve Bayes, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), decision table, and random tree have been carried out. Their class-prediction accuracy has been compared using supplied test set. Ripeness classification of tomato images is done based on color using a previously proposed fuzzy rule based classification (FRBC) approach and are classified into three classes unripe, ab2ripe, and ripe. Grounded on classification, multi-labeling methodology is adopted for automatic annotation of tomato images. From the experimental results it is established that RandomTree classifier performs well for the classification of tomato firmne- s. In addition, presented work takes the advantage of progression in machine vision to address the issue of semantic gap in multimodal retrieval.},

abstract={For face naming in TV series or movies, a typical way is using subtitles/script alignment to get the time stamps of the names, and tagging them to the faces. We study the problem of face naming in videos when subtitles are not available. To this end, we divide the problem into two tasks: face clustering which groups the faces depicting a certain person into a cluster, and name assignment which associates a name to each face. Each task is formulated as a structured prediction problem and modeled by a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) model. We argue that the two tasks are correlated problems whose outputs can provide prior knowledge of the target prediction for each other. The two HCRFs are coupled in a unified graphical model called coupled HCRF where the joint dependence of the cluster labels and face name association is naturally embedded in the correlation between the two HCRFs. We provide an effective algorithm to optimize the two HCRFs iteratively and the performance of the two tasks on real-world data set can be both improved.},

year={2016},
volume={1},

abstract={Stack Overflow is a popular community-based Q&A website that caters to technical needs of software developers. As of February 2015 - Stack Overflow has more than 3.9M registered users, 8.8M questions, and 41M comments. Stack Overflow provides explicit and detailed guidelines on how to post questions but, some questions are very poor in quality. Such questions are deleted by the experienced community members and moderators. Deleted questions increase maintenance cost and have an adverse impact on the user experience. Therefore, predicting deleted questions is an important task. In this study, we propose a two stage hybrid approach - DelPredictor - which combines text processing and classification techniques to predict deleted questions. In the first stage, DelPredictor converts text in the title, body, and tag fields of questions into numerical textual features via text processing and classification techniques. In the second stage, it extracts meta features that can be categorized into: profile, community, content, and syntactic features. Next, it learns and combines two independent classifiers built on the textual and meta features. We evaluate DelPredictor on 5 years (2008-2013) of deleted questions from Stack Overflow. Our experimental results show that DelPredictor improves the F1-scores over baseline prediction, a prior approach [12] and a text-based approach by 29.50%, 9.34%, and 28.11%, respectively.},

abstract={The function of a protein is determined by its structure, which creates a need for efficient methods of protein structure determination to advance scientific and medical research. Because current experimental structure determination methods carry a high price tag, computational predictions are highly desirable. Given a protein sequence, computational methods produce numerous 3D structures known as decoys. However, selection of the best quality decoys is challenging as the end users can handle only a few ones. Therefore, scoring functions are central to decoy selection. They combine measurable features into a single number indicator of decoy quality. Unfortunately, current scoring functions do not consistently select the best decoys. Machine learning techniques offer great potential to improve decoy scoring. This paper presents two machine-learning based scoring functions to predict the quality of proteins structures, i.e., the similarity between the predicted structure and the experimental one without knowing the latter. We use different metrics to compare these scoring functions against three state-of-the-art scores. This is a first attempt at comparing different scoring functions using the same non-redundant dataset for training and testing and the same features. The results show that adding informative features may be more significant than the method used.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) shows great significance in clinical decision-making, which explores the visual content of medical images rather than keywords, tags, or descriptions. It provides doctors an image-guided approach to explore relevant cases that could offer doctors instructive reference. Mammogram screening has been known to be widely used in the early-stage diagnosis of breast cancer, and could reduce its morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we aim to develop a scalable CBIR method for a large repository of mammogram. To this end, we extend the original Anchor Graph Hashing (AGH) and propose a new unsupervised hashing algorithm, named as Composite Anchor Graph Hashing with Iterative Quantization (CAGH- ITQ), which compresses mammographic ROIs into compact binary codes and enables real-time searching in Hamming space. Multimodal features and different distance metrics are integrated, performing upon a composite Anchor Graph. To improve the effectiveness of the hash code, quantization error is further iteratively minimized by introducing an orthogonal rotation matrix. We evaluate the presented C-AGH-ITQ algorithm on a dataset of 11; 533 mammographic ROIs obtained from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). Our method obtains more than 84% retrieval precision and 93% classification accuracy (by using k-NN prediction), which demonstrates that hash codes produced by C-AGH-ITQ well capture the visual similarities between mammographic images. In addition, since C-AGH-ITQ ensures linear complexity of the training procedure and constant time for query, our system is readily applicable to large-scale mammogram databases and has the potential to provide abundant clinical cases as reference.},

abstract={The proliferation of location-based social networks, such as Foursquare and Facebook Places, offers a variety of ways to record human mobility, including user generated geo-tagged contents, check-in services, and mobile apps. Although trajectory data is of great value to many applications, it is challenging to analyze and mine trajectory data due to the complex characteristics reflected in human mobility, which is affected by multiple contextual information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Context Trajectory Embedding Model, called MC-TEM, to explore contexts in a systematic way. MC-TEM is developed in the distributed representation learning framework, and it is flexible to characterize various kinds of useful contexts for different applications. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the distributed representation learning methods apply to trajectory data. We formally incorporate multiple context information of trajectory data into the proposed model, including user-level, trajectory-level, location-level, and temporal contexts. All the context information is represented in the same embedding space. We apply MC-TEM to two challenging tasks, namely location recommendation and social link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Extensive experiment results have demonstrated the superiority of our MC-TEM model over several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Database design process involves analysis of system requirements described in natural language for manual extraction of conceptual schema. This is a tedious process and prone to human error. Earlier approaches of automation of this process had made use of either a finite set of rules, Context Free Grammars (CFG) or semantic understanding. Rule and CFG based approaches are not robust enough to cover all possible scenarios; whereas semantic approaches are not generic and have domain dependencies. We have defined an approach where the sequence part-of-speech (POS) tags of a sentence are annotated to ER components and a set of such annotated sentences serves as our corpus. Use of POS tags instead of the actual terms in a sentence makes the approach more robust, generic and domain-independent. We have also defined our own algorithm, which takes an input sentence and uses an extension of Edit Distance technique, to find out similar matches for a POS sequence of an input sentence with an associated cost, if a perfect match is not found. The accuracy of our current system is 54%. The feedback provided by the user is used to update the underlying model making the approach more interactive and improving the accuracy of future predictions.},

abstract={The objective of the REWARD project consisted in building a mobile system for real time, wide area radiation surveillance, using a CdZnTe detector for gamma radiation and a neutron detector based on novel silicon technologies. The sensing unit includes a GPS system and a wireless communication interface to send the data remotely to a monitoring base station, where it will be analyzed in real time and correlated with historical data from the tag location, in order to generate an alarm when an abnormal situation is detected. The main objective of this work consisted in making predictions regarding the behavior of the REWARD system in the presence of a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD), one of the reference scenarios foreseen for REWARD, using the Monte Carlo simulation program MCNP6. Experimental tests were performed at the Fire Brigades Facilities in Rome and at the Naples Fire Brigades. The response of the REWARD detection system to the presence of an RDD is predicted and discussed.},

pages={579-590},
abstract={Currently, most web service recommendation studies concentrate on mining association patterns among services from historical compositions and recommending proper services based on patterns derived. However, latent negative patterns which indicate the inappropriate combinations of services, are mostly ignored. Therefore, by combining additional negative patterns with the already-exploited positive patterns in the large spares network of web services, we present a more comprehensive and accurate model for service recommendation. More specifically, we combine positive and negative composition patterns mined from service annotated tags. The extensive experiments conducted on a real-life dataset show that our method can outperform not only traditional APriori -based recommendation method but also Link Prediction-based one. The experiments on a synthetic dataset show that our method can also be effective to make recommendations in large-scale service network.},

title={Efficient footprint caching for Tagless DRAM Caches},
year={2016},
pages={237-248},
abstract={Efficient cache tag management is a primary design objective for large, in-package DRAM caches. Recently, Tagless DRAM Caches (TDCs) have been proposed to completely eliminate tagging structures from both on-die SRAM and in-package DRAM, which are a major scalability bottleneck for future multi-gigabyte DRAM caches. However, TDC imposes a constraint on DRAM cache block size to be the same as OS page size (e.g., 4KB) as it takes a unified approach to address translation and cache tag management. Caching at a page granularity, or page-based caching, incurs significant off-package DRAM bandwidth waste by over-fetching blocks within a page that are not actually used. Footprint caching is an effective solution to this problem, which fetches only those blocks that will likely be touched during the page's lifetime in the DRAM cache, referred to as the page's footprint. In this paper we demonstrate TDC opens up unique opportunities to realize efficient footprint caching with higher prediction accuracy and a lower hardware cost than the original footprint caching scheme. Since there are no cache tags in TDC, the footprints of cached pages are tracked at TLB, instead of cache tag array, to incur much lower on-die storage overhead than the original design. Besides, when a cached page is evicted, its footprint will be stored in the corresponding page table entry, instead of an auxiliary on-die structure (i.e., Footprint History Table), to prevent footprint thrashing among different pages, thus yielding higher accuracy in footprint prediction. The resulting design, called Footprint-augmented Tagless DRAM Cache (F-TDC), significantly improves the bandwidth efficiency of TDC, and hence its performance and energy efficiency. Our evaluation with 3D Through-Silicon-Via-based in-package DRAM demonstrates an average reduction of off-package bandwidth by 32.0%, which, in turn, improves IPC and EDP by 17.7% and 25.4%, respectively, over the state-of-the-art TDC with no footprint cachi- g.},

title={Architecting On-Chip DRAM Cache for Simultaneous Miss Rate and Latency Reduction},
year={2016},
volume={35},
number={4},
pages={651-664},
abstract={On-chip dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cache has been recently employed in the memory hierarchy to mitigate the widening latency gap between high-speed cores and off-chip memory. Two important parameters are the DRAM cache miss rate (D$-MR) and the DRAM cache hit latency (D$-HL), as they strongly influence the performance. These parameters depend upon the DRAM set mapping policy. Recently proposed DRAM set mapping policies are predominantly optimized for either D$-MR or D$-HL. We propose novel DRAM set mapping policies that simultaneously reduce D$-MR (via high associativity) and D$-HL (via improved row buffer hit rates). To further improve the D$-HL, we propose a small and low latency DRAM Tag cache (DTC) structure that can quickly determine whether an access to the DRAM cache will be a hit or a miss. The performance of the proposed DTC depends upon the DTC hit rate. To increase it, we present a novel DTC insertion policy that also increases the DTC hit rate. We investigate the latency and miss rate tradeoffs when designing a DRAM cache hierarchy and analyze the effects of different policies on the overall performance. We evaluate our policies on a wide variety of workloads and compare its performance with three recent proposals for on-chip DRAM caches. For a 16-core system, our set mapping policy along with our DTC and its adaptive DTC insertion policy improve the harmonic mean instruction per cycle throughput by 25.4%, 15.5%, and 7.3% compared to state-of-the-art, while requiring 55% less storage overhead for DRAM cache hit/miss prediction.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of predicting Twitter hashtags popularity level. A data set of more than 18 million tweets containing 748 thousand hashtags has been prepared by using Twitter's Streaming API. Early adoption properties including profile of tweet authors and adoption time series are used to predict a tag's later popularity level. The followers count and tweets count are two such characteristics related to adopters' profile. On the other hand, two types of frequency domain analyses are used to augment the simple mean and standard deviation characteristics of the adoption time series. Fourier transform (FT) spectrum and wavelet transform (WT) spectrum are considered in this study. Experimental results show that WT spectrum improves the prediction result of viral hashtags while FT spectrum does not.},

abstract={The proliferation of sensor devices monitoring human activity generates voluminous amount of temporal sequences needing to be interpreted and categorized. Moreover, complex behavior detection requires the personalization of multi-sensor fusion algorithms. Conditional random fields (CRFs) are commonly used in structured prediction tasks such as part-of-speech tagging in natural language processing. Conditional probabilities guide the choice of each tag/label in the sequence conflating the structured prediction task with the sequence classification task where different models provide different categorization of the same sequence. The claim of this paper is that CRF models also provide discriminative models to distinguish between types of sequence regardless of the accuracy of the labels obtained if we calibrate the class membership estimate of the sequence. We introduce and compare different neural network based linear-chain CRFs and we present experiments on two complex sequence classification and structured prediction tasks to support this claim.},

However, not all questions are answered by these communities. Also, many questions are not answered quickly enough. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting users' response time. The framework uses a diverse set of features including information on users, the content they generate while communicating, question tags, spatial and temporal features. Then these features are used as input for training predictive models by various machine learning algorithms. As a case study, three diverse Q&A communities from Stack Exchange are selected to test the framework. We demonstrate that Deep Belief Networks outperform Logistic Regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Trees (DT) in the accuracy of the prediction across the three diverse Q&A communities.},
