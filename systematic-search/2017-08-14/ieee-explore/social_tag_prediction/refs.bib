abstract={One of the characteristics of tag prediction mechanisms is that, typically, all user models are constructed with the same granularity. In this paper we hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that in order to increase tag prediction accuracy, the granularity of each user model has to be adapted to the level of usage of each particular user. We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

abstract={Folksonomies enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with tags. Tag recommendation can suggest tags that maximize utility and help to promote resource sharing and collaboration.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is the aggregate effort by a community of online users to annotate web content with metadata labels called tags. It is a simple activity that enriches our knowledge about digital content, and has gained popularity with services such as Del.icio.us.

We present TagScore, a scoring function to rate the goodness of Del.icio.us tags for their associated web page.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems with user generated content have become a fundamental element of websites such as Delicious, Flickr or CiteULike. By sharing common knowledge, massively linked semantic data sets are generated that provide new challenges for data mining. In this paper, we reduce the data complexity in these systems by finding meaningful topics that serve to group similar users and serve to recommend tags or resources to users. We propose a well-founded probabilistic approach that can model every aspect of a collaborative tagging system. By integrating both user information and tag information into the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework, the developed models can be used to solve a number of important information extraction and retrieval tasks.},

abstract={We consider the problem of learning distributed representations for documents from their content and associated tags, and of distributed representations of users from documents and tags provided by users. The documents, words, and tags are represented as low-dimensional vectors and are jointly learned with a multi-layered neural language model. We propose a two stage method where in the first stage which consists of two layers, we exploit the corpus wide topic-level information contained in tags to model one layer of neural language model and use document level words sequence information to model other layer of the proposed architecture. In the second stage, we use thus obtained document and tags representations to learn user representations. We utilize these jointly trained vector representations for personalized tag recommendation tasks. Our experiments on two widely used bookmarking datasets show a significant improvements for quality of recommendations. These continuous vector representations has the added advantages of conceptually meaningful which we show by our qualitative analysis on tag suggestion tasks.},

In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results.

abstract={This paper proposes an unsupervised method for generating informative tags for multi-party dialogue in an open domain. Our model first extracts keywords from text through a multi-weighting framework, which includes frequency weighting, sentence weighting, speaker weighting and position weighting. Then we get their bigrams through frequent pattern matching. In order to generate more flexible and socialized tags, we expand keywords and their bigrams by exploring tag associations mined from a famous bookmarking web del.icio.us. Finally we rank the three parts of tag candidates under a uniform metric. Unlike previous models used for tag recommendation task, our model needs neither seed tags for source texts nor a complete tag set. It can recommend new tags out of the historical tag set. We evaluate our methods on 10,265 Chinese dialogues. Experimental results show our method outperform previous models like TextRank, TFIDF rank and KNN.},

abstract={Folksonomy systems provide a way for users to share and organize bookmarks. The social relationship among users has become stronger with the rapid development of new technologies. Finding the leading objects has become an important topic. These research topics are always centered around finding the most popular pages or experts. In this paper, we propose a new notion of expertise, which we call user insight. User insight denotes the user's expertise in finding Web pages that are useful or have the potential to be popular pages before other users find them. To address the issue, we refer to three major types of Web pages, namely, isolated, well-known, and burgeoning. Burgeoning pages are exceptionally useful and attractive for users in a folksonomy system. In our paper, we build a time-based algorithm to estimate user insight. In addition, we discuss the social relationship within fan networks, and we propose a link-based algorithm called CAIS (Community-based Annotation Insight Search) to realize the reinforcement between users, communities and pages. Finally, we design several experiments to evaluate the performance of CAIS and compare it to other approaches. We prove that CAIS has a better performance for the user ranking of simulated data and real data from Delicious.},

abstract={More and more content on the Web is generated by users. To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, tag estimation is challenging due to massive sparsity, uncertainty in the tags actually used, as well as diversity across locations and times. Toward overcoming these challenges, we propose a community-based smoothing approach that seeks to uncover hidden conceptual communities which link multiple related locations by their common interests in addition to their proximity. Through extensive experiments over a sample of millions of geotagged Twitter posts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the smoothing approach and validate the intuition that geo-locations have the tendency to share similar “ideas” in the formation of conceptual communities.},

This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

year={2017},
volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-14},
abstract={Crowdsourcing systems provide a cost effective and convenient way to collect labels, but they often fail to guarantee the quality of the labels. This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

To include candidate tags beyond the existing vocabularies of the query resource and of the query user, we examine recommendation methods that are based on personomy translation, and propose a probabilistic framework for adopting translations from similar users (neighbors). We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

The expansion coefficients are learned to minimize the global error between the prediction and the ground truth. We derive an analytic solution to learn the coefficients efficiently. We further extend this model to handle the cost-sensitive multi-label classification problem, and apply it in social tagging to handle the issue of the noisy training set by treating the tag counts as the misclassification costs. We have conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets and compared our method with other state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods. Experimental results on both multi-label classification and cost-sensitive social tagging demonstrate that our method has better performance than other methods.},

We present an alternative approach that facilitates the generation of the structured metadata which is useful for querying the database. Document annotations are comments, notes, or other types of external remarks that can be attached to a document. Our approach relies on the idea that humans can add the valuable metadata during creation time prompted by an interface. We can increase the quality of searching to some extent, if the documents are properly annotated. Existing probabilistic approaches have some demerits. This paper proposes an approach that uses inverted indexing scheme for effective mining of informations.

abstract={As Internet usage and e-commerce grow, online social media serve as popular outlets for consumers to express sentiments about products. On Amazon, users can tag an album with a keyword, while tweets on Twitter represent a more natural conversation. The differing natures of these media make them difficult to compare. This project collects and analyzes social media data for newly released music albums and develops new methods of comparing a product's social tags to its microblogging data. It explores information retrieval and rank correlation measures as similarity measures, as well as term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) processing. We conclude that with sufficient Twitter activity about an album, social tags do represent the most frequent conversations occurring on Twitter. These results imply that managers can collect and analyze tags and use them as a proxy for most common consumer feedback from microblogging, which is more difficult to collect.},

abstract={Social tagging is becoming more and more popular in various Web 2.0 applications nowadays. It is important for many web-sites with tagging capabilities like “delicious” or “flickr”. These social tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanism which assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them, where tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item. In this paper, we propose an approach for tag recommendation based on users' interest lattice matching (UILM). UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments.},

abstract={Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing web pages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

abstract={This article investigates the dynamic features of social tagging vocabularies in Delicious, Flickr and YouTube from 2003 to 2008. It analyzes the evolution of the usage of the most popular tags in each of these three social networks. We find that for different tagging systems, the dynamic features reflect different cognitive processes. At the macro level, the tag growth obeys power-law distribution for all three tagging systems with exponents lower than one. At the micro level, the tag growth of popular resources in all three tagging systems follows a similar power-law distribution. Moreover, we find that the exponents of tag growth varied in different evolving stages of popular individual resources.},

pages={153-159},
abstract={Collaborative filtering technology is one major method used in recommendation systems. Most existing collaborative filtering algorithms merely use rating data as their prediction input. Social tags have become widely used in web applications which not only reflect the user's personality but also item's properties and semantic meanings. We design an algorithmic framework by extending item-based collaborative filtering with social tags which we call IBeST. IBeST contains the whole lifecycle of the item similarity measurement based on social tags and improves item-based algorithmic results in four phases: dataset preprocessing, metadata injection, algorithm selection and optimization, and similarity weight selection. The calculated similarity is then used in item-based algorithm. MovieLens 10M ratings 100k tags dataset is used in our experiment. IBeST generates improved recommendation ratings than baseline item-based algorithms, and provides a feasible and loosely coupled solution to use social tags in item-based recommendation system.},

title={Content-Based Semantic Tag Ranking for Recommendation},
year={2012},
volume={1},
pages={292-296},
abstract={Content-based social tagging recommendation, which considers the relationship between the tags and the descriptions contained in resources, is proposed to remedy the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering. There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

abstract={As the number of online students has been growing significantly for the last couple of years, generic Web Information Retrieval methods have either maintained an emphasis on serving the general population, or have been lagging in integrating the power of adaptive semantics and personalization via knowledge discovery into real-life working E-learning applications. This paper is devoted to the implementation of an augmented ontology-based information retrieval system with external open-source resources from MIT OpenCourseWare that uses Protégé to design and build the structure of HyperManyMedia ontology as means of retrieving documents in two languages, English and Spanish. In addition, this paper deals with clustering the augmented documents, the outcome of the Clustering Analysis is added to the domain ontology as additional leaves under the “SubSubSubconcept = lecture”. From each cluster, we extract the Topn keywords (descriptive terms), then we modify the ontology accordingly by adding the cluster's terms as semantic terms under the “SubSubSubconcept = lecture” to which these documents belong. This research is implemented and evaluated on a real platform HyperManyMedia at Western Kentucky University.},

year={2012},
pages={23-25},
abstract={Prior knowledge in concept acquisition among students is an important issue. Traditional studies on prior knowledge generation during learning have focused on extracting sentences from reading materials that are manually generated by website administrators and educators. From the reports of previous studies, tag-based recommendation and assessment has been recognized as being an effective approach that can assist learners in finding out the clues and concepts of articles, such that it enables learners to be familiar with the learning content. However, sparse noisy data influences the quality of recommendations, especially for tag choices that are not mapped to the features of both the users and content. To cope with these problems, we adopt a hybrid recommendation method to consider tag preference, tag relevance and social networking. The experimental results show that the approach benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge, and can be an effective and efficient mechanism for enhancing the quality of prior knowledge recommendation.},

title={Modeling semantic correspondence in heterogeneous structured document collection},
year={2011},
pages={189-196},
abstract={On the web, most structured document collections consist of documents from different sources and marked up with different types of structures. The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness. We introduce a generic and flexible structured document model to represent heterogeneous structured documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections. We also illustrate how the proposed model can be utilized in structured document retrieval.},

abstract={Illicit drug use is a serious problem around the world. Social media has increasingly become an important tool for analyzing drug use patterns and monitoring emerging drug abuse trends. Accurately retrieving illicit drug-related social media posts is an important step in this research. Frequently, hashtags are used to identify and retrieve posts on a specific topic. However hashtags are highly ambiguous. Posts with the same hashtags are not always on the same topic. Moreover, hashtags are evolving, especially those related to illicit drugs. New street names are introduced constantly to avoid detection. In this paper, we employ topic modeling to disambiguate hashtags and track the changes of hashtags using semantic word embedding. Our preliminary evaluation shows the promise of these methods.},
