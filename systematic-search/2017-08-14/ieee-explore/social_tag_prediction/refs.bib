title={Prediction of social tag frequency's power law distribution with RGF model},
year={2012},
pages={1884-1889},
abstract={The power law distribution of social tag frequency is one of the most important statistic characteristics in social tagging system. Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

abstract={Social tagging predictions involve the co occurrence of users, items and tags. The tremendous growth of users require the recommender system to produce tag recommendations for millions of users and items at any minute. The triplets of users, items and tags are most naturally described by a 3D tensor, and tensor decomposition-based algorithms can produce high quality recommendations. However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, Para Fac, and Low-order tensor decompositions. We show that these algorithm can very efficiently compute the needed decompositions. We evaluate the fold-in algorithms experimentally on several datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.},

pages={621-625},
abstract={Being able to predict whether a song can be a hit has important applications in the music industry. Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

abstract={With the availability of cheap location sensors, geotagging of images in online social media is very popular. With a large amount of geo-tagged social images, it is interesting to study how these images are shared across geographical regions and how the geographical language characteristics and vision patterns are distributed across different regions. Unlike textual document, geo-tagged social image contains multiple types of content, i.e., textual description, visual content, and geographical information. Existing approaches usually mine geographical characteristics using a subset of multiple types of image contents or combining those contents linearly, which ignore correlations between different types of contents, and their geographical distributions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method to discover geographical characteristics of geo-tagged social images using a geographical topic model called geographical topic model of social images (GTMSIs). GTMSI integrates multiple types of social image contents as well as the geographical distributions, in which image topics are modeled based on both vocabulary and visual features. In GTMSI, each region of the image would have its own topic distribution, and hence have its own language model and vision pattern. Experimental results show that our GTMSI could identify interesting topics and vision patterns, as well as provide location prediction and image tagging.},

abstract={In this letter, the authors show that structured social media data can act as an accurate predictor for wireless data demand patterns at a high spatial-temporal resolution. A casestudy is performed on Greater London covering a 5000 km2 area. The data used includes over 0.6 million geo-tagged Twitter data, over 1 million mobile phone data demand records, and U.K. census data. The analysis shows that social media activity (Tweets/s n) can accurately predict the long-term traffic demand for both the uplink and downlink channels. The relationship between social media activity and traffic demand obeys a power law and the model explains for over 71%-79% of the variance in real traffic demand. This is a significant improvement over existing methods of long-term traffic prediction such as census population data (R2 = 0.57). The authors also show that social media data can also forward predict short-term traffic demand for up to 2 h on the same day and for the same time in the following 2-3 days.},

abstract={This study investigates whether taking genre into account is beneficial for automatic music mood annotation in terms of core affects valence, arousal, and tension, as well as several other mood scales. Novel techniques employing genre-adaptive semantic computing and audio-based modelling are proposed. A technique called the ACTwg employs genre-adaptive semantic computing of mood-related social tags, whereas ACTwg-SLPwg combines semantic computing and audio-based modelling, both in a genre-adaptive manner. The proposed techniques are experimentally evaluated at predicting listener ratings related to a set of 600 popular music tracks spanning multiple genres. The results show that ACTwg outperforms a semantic computing technique that does not exploit genre information, and ACTwg-SLPwg outperforms conventional techniques and other genre-adaptive alternatives. In particular, improvements in the prediction rates are obtained for the valence dimension which is typically the most challenging core affect dimension for audio-based annotation. The specificity of genre categories is not crucial for the performance of ACTwg-SLPwg. The study also presents analytical insights into inferring a concise tag-based genre representation for genre-adaptive music mood analysis.},

title={Querying Users as Oracles in Tag Engines for Personalized Image Tagging},
year={2017},
volume={24},
number={2},
pages={66-75},
abstract={A common trend in image-tagging research is to focus on visually relevant tags; however, this tends to ignore the personal and social aspects of tags, especially on photo blogging websites such as Flickr. Previous work has correctly identified that many of the tags that users provide on images are not visually relevant (that is, representative of the salient content in the image) and they go on to treat such tags as noise, ignoring the fact that the users chose to provide those tags over others that could have been more visually relevant. Another common assumption about user-generated tags for images is that the order of these tags provides no useful information for the prediction of tags on future images. This assumption also tends to define usefulness in terms of what is visually relevant to the image. For general tagging or labeling applications that focus on providing visual information about image content, these assumptions are reasonable, but when considering personalized image-tagging applications, these assumptions are at best too rigid, ignoring user choice and preferences. This article challenges these assumptions and provides a machine learning approach to the problem of personalized image tagging. The authors reformulate the personalized image-tagging problem as a search/retrieval ranking problem and leverage the order of tags provided by the user in the past as a cue to tag preferences, similar to click data. They propose a technique to augment sparse user tag data (semisupervision) and demonstrate the efficacy of this method on a subset of Flickr images.},

abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations.},

abstract={Automatic image annotation has drawn much attention in the last two decades due to its application in social images organization. Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet, more and more people use social networks to share information and express their views, which lead to a vigorous growth of information. How to select useful and interesting information for users, that is user topic interest, gets more and more attention. Tag functionality in microblog can get user topic interests easily and achieve information recommendation effectively. To deal with the situation that there are few or no tags for most users in microblog, a user topic interest prediction method based on the tag content and interactive relations of users is proposed. The method utilizes Wikipedia to extend the tags and produce a preliminary estimate of the tags' importance. What's more, interactive relations and propagation analysis of different tags are studied. An extensive empirical study using real Sina Microblog data clearly demonstrates that our method has a better performance in user topic interest prediction.},

We investigate the use of spatiotemporally tagged Twitter posts for inferring micro-level movement patterns, and we use real crime data to develop and test a model informed by such patterns.

year={2016},
pages={486-492},
abstract={Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

pages={3784-3791},
abstract={Multi-label classification (MLC) is a supervised learning problem in which a particular example can be associated with a set of labels instead of a single one as in traditional classification. Many real-world applications, such as Web page classification or resource tagging on the Social Web, are challenging for existing MLC algorithms, because the label space grows exponentially as instance space increases. Under the problem transformation approach, the most common alternative for MLC, multi-label problems are transformed into several single label problems, whose outputs are then aggregated into a prediction to the whole classification problem. Feature selection techniques become crucial in large-scale MLC problems to help reducing dimensionality. However, the impact of feature selection in multi-label setting has not been as extensively studied as in the case of single-label data. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of feature selection techniques in the context of the three main problem transformation MLC methods: Binary Relevance, Pair-wise and Label power-set. Experimentation was performed across a number of benchmark datasets for multi-label classification exhibiting varied characteristics, which allows observing the behavior of techniques and assessing their impact according to multiple metrics.},

However, users' social media activities, such as tweets sent, do not always reveal their location. We consider the problem of estimating geo-tags for tweets and develop a comprehensive approach that incorporates textual content, the user's personalized behavior, and the user's social relationships. Our approach, Percimo, considers the two major kinds of communal attachment, which have distinct computational ramifications. We evaluate Percimo via three geo-social graphs based on the mutual-follow relationships of Twitter users, their geographical distance (computed from their geotagged tweets), and their preferences for location categories (collected from Foursquare). We find that Percimo yields a smaller prediction error than the two state-of-the-art approaches we compare with.},

abstract={The proliferation of location-based social networks, such as Foursquare and Facebook Places, offers a variety of ways to record human mobility, including user generated geo-tagged contents, check-in services, and mobile apps. Although trajectory data is of great value to many applications, it is challenging to analyze and mine trajectory data due to the complex characteristics reflected in human mobility, which is affected by multiple contextual information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Context Trajectory Embedding Model, called MC-TEM, to explore contexts in a systematic way. MC-TEM is developed in the distributed representation learning framework, and it is flexible to characterize various kinds of useful contexts for different applications. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the distributed representation learning methods apply to trajectory data. We formally incorporate multiple context information of trajectory data into the proposed model, including user-level, trajectory-level, location-level, and temporal contexts. All the context information is represented in the same embedding space. We apply MC-TEM to two challenging tasks, namely location recommendation and social link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Extensive experiment results have demonstrated the superiority of our MC-TEM model over several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Social media and online Question and Answer (Q&A) communities in particular have become a successful solution for finding answers on diverse topics. However, not all questions are answered by these communities. Also, many questions are not answered quickly enough. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting users' response time. The framework uses a diverse set of features including information on users, the content they generate while communicating, question tags, spatial and temporal features. Then these features are used as input for training predictive models by various machine learning algorithms. As a case study, three diverse Q&A communities from Stack Exchange are selected to test the framework. We demonstrate that Deep Belief Networks outperform Logistic Regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Trees (DT) in the accuracy of the prediction across the three diverse Q&A communities.},

year={2015},
pages={204-209},
abstract={Social graphs, representing the online friendships among users, are one of the most fundamental types of data for many social media applications, such as recommendation, virality prediction and marketing. However, this data may be unavailable due to the privacy concerns of users, or kept privately by social network operators, which makes such applications difficult. One of the possible solutions to discover user connections is to use shared content, especially images on online social networks, such as Flickr and Instagram. This paper investigates how non-user generated labels annotated on shared images can be used for connection discovery with different color-based and feature-based methods. The label distribution is computed to represent users, and followee/follower relationships are recommended based on the distribution similarity. These methods are evaluated with over 200k images from Flickr and it is proven that with non-user generated labels, user connections can be discovered, regardless of the method used. Feature-based methods are also proven to be 95% better than color-based methods, and 65% better than tag-based methods.},

year={2015},
pages={49-52},
abstract={With the rapid growth of social media and online news services, users nowadays can respond to online news by rating subjective emotions such as happiness, surprise or anger actively. Once the user ratings is over a certain range, it begins to show up a tendency of what most people think and feel, which can help us understand the preferences and perspectives of most users, and help news providers to provide users with more positive news. Thus it has become a pregnant research problem to tag emotion automatically. This paper tackles the task of emotion tagging for online news with multi-source including news article and comment, as emotion is not only tagged after reading news article, but also can be incorporated in comment with what they feel. In this paper, a novel classification model are proposed with two layer logistic regression. The new approach get outputs from basic classifiers and combine them in a new classifier, making a more accurate prediction when compared with a single source method. An extensive set of experimental results on a real dataset from a popular online news service demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract={With the rapidly growing of real-time social media, like Twitter, many users share and discuss their interest topics through such platforms. Hashtag is a type of metadata tag which allows users to annotate their topics of tweets. For research usage, for example, hashtags can help the performance of event detection by observing the trend of hashtags. Although Twitter grows rapidly, hashtag growth is not as expected. Our dataset shows that there are less than 20% of all tweets containing hashtags. We think that it is caused by that most users may have no idea what hashtags are suitable for tweets they post. If we can recommend suitable hashtags to users, it can be one of the solutions to solve the problem of low usage rate of hashtag. Hashtag recommendation belongs to supervised learning problem. More labeled data for training the learning model can get higher performance in prediction. However, labeled data in hashtag recommendation is not so much due to low usage rate of hashtag. Thus, we want to exploit unlabeled data, i.e. non-hashtag tweets, to solve this problem. Now we have large amount of unlabeled data, but directly adding all non-hashtag tweets may not be helpful to train the model. To overcome this issue, we apply the weight-updating mechanisms to filter out the useless parts of non-hashtag tweets. These mechanisms also have to consider the temporal characteristics of hashtag due to the real-time nature of Twitter. The experimental results in this research show that adding non-hashtag tweets to extend original training data outperforms baseline methods which only exploit labeled data to train the model.},

abstract={During the last decade, we have witnessed the prosperity of the Internet-based social platforms and mobile social applications such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. Meanwhile, due to the popularity of mobile terminals such as smart phones and variety of PADs, it is feasible to obtain relatively accurate tempo-spatial data from mobile terminal holders when they visit and upload geo-tagged messages or pictures to Internet based social platform. Therefore, it is observed that the volume of tempo-spatial social data posted on social platforms keeps increasing. This brings us more opportunities to mine the semantic information according to the analysis on the tempo spatial social information collected from Internet-based social platforms. In this paper, we present an approach to social relationship ranking by mining the tempo-spatial social data. To deal with the sparsity of raw tempo-spatial social data, the location prediction technique is employed. According to the comparison between the social relationship ranking method with location prediction and its version without location prediction, it shows that the former outperforms the latter substantially. Finally, we make several helpful observations about the social relationship ranking method when location prediction technique is adopted.},

abstract={Billions of user-shared images are generated by individuals in many social networks today, and this particular form of user data is widely accessible to others due to the nature of online social sharing. When user social graphs are only accessible to exclusive parties, these user-shared images are proved to be an easier and effective alternative to discover user connections. This work investigated over 360 000 user shared images from two social networks, Skyrock and 163 Weibo, in which 3 million follower/ followee relationships are involved. It is observed that the shared images from users with a follower / followee relationship show relatively higher similarities . A multimedia big data system that utilizes this observed phenomenon is proposed as an alternative to user- generated tags and social graphs for follower/followee recommendation and gender identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in this field to prove and formulate such a phenomenon for mass user-shared images along with more practical prediction methods. These findings are useful for information or services recommendations in any social network with intensive image sharing, as well as for other interesting personalization applications, particularly when there is no access to those exclusive user social graphs.},

abstract={Social networking services have the hidden potential to reveal valuable insights when statistical analysis is applied to their unstructured data. As shown by previous research, GPS-tagged Twitter data enables the prediction of future crimes in a major city, Chicago, Illinois, of the United States. However, existing crime prediction models that incorporate data from Twitter have limitations in describing criminal incidents due to the absence of sentiment polarity and weather factors. The addition of sentiment analysis and weather predictors to such models would deliver significant insight about how crime. Our aim is to predict the time and location in which a specific type of crime will occur. Our approach is based on sentiment analysis by applying lexicon-based methods and understanding of categorized weather data, combined with kernel density estimation based on historical crime incidents and prediction via linear modeling. By testing our model's ability to predict future crime on each area of the city, we observed that the model surpassed the benchmark model, which predicts crime incidents using kernel density estimation.},

abstract={The semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics is a well-known challenge in content-based multimedia information retrieval. With the rapid popularization of social media, which allows users to assign tags to describe images and videos, attention is naturally drawn to take advantage of these metadata in order to bridge the semantic gap. This paper proposes a sparse linear integration (SLI) model that focuses on integrating visual content and its associated metadata, which are referred to as the content and the context modalities, respectively, for semantic concept retrieval. An optimization problem is formulated to approximate an instance using a sparse linear combination of other instances and minimize the difference between them. The prediction score of a concept for a test instance measures how well it can be reconstructed by the positive instances of that concept. Two benchmark image data sets and their associated tags are used to evaluate the SLI model. Experimental results show promising performance by comparing with the approaches based on a single modality and approaches based on popular fusion methods.},

abstract={We propose an automatic method that addresses the challenge of predicting the geo-location of social images using only the visual content of those images. Our method is able to generate a geo-location prediction for an image globally . In this respect, it contrasts with other existing approaches, specifically with those that generate predictions restricted to specific cities, landmarks, or an otherwise pre-defined set of locations. The essence and the main novelty of our ranking-based method is that for a given query image a geo-location is recommended based on the evidence collected from images that are not only geographically close to this geo-location, but also have sufficient visual similarity to the query image within the considered image collection. Our method is evaluated experimentally on a public dataset of 8.8 million geo-tagged images from Flickr, released by the MediaEval 2013 evaluation benchmark. Experiments show that the proposed method delivers a substantial performance improvement compared to the existing related approaches, particularly for queries with high numbers of neighbors . In addition, a detailed analysis of the method's performance reveals the impact of different visual feature extraction and image matching strategies, as well as the densities and types of images found at different locations, on the prediction accuracy.},

abstract={With an increasing number of images that are available in social media, image annotation has emerged as an important research topic due to its application in image matching and retrieval. Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

year={2014},
pages={10-19},
abstract={Online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have started allowing users to tag their posts with geographical coordinates collected through the GPS interface of users smartphones. While this information is quite useful and already indicative of user behavior, it also lacks some semantics about the type of place the user is (e.g., restaurant, museum, school) which would allow a better understanding of users' patterns. While some location based online social network services (e.g., Foursquare) allow users to tag the places they visit, this is not an automated process but one which requires the user help. In this paper we exploit the dynamics of human activity to associate categories to GPS coordinates of social network posts. We have collected geo-tagged tweets of a large city through Twitter. A supervised learning framework takes the tweets spatial-temporal features and determines human dynamics which we use to infer the place category. Our results over the data show that the prediction framework is able to accurately identify if a place is of a certain category given its user activity patterns. The average accuracy is about 70%, reaching the highest accuracy for work (90%) and educational places (80%). Moreover the framework identifies the category of a place, with an accuracy up to 66%, finding out where people eat and drink, go for entertainment, or work/study.},

abstract={Social tags inherent in online music services such as Last.fm provide a rich source of information on musical moods. The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.},

abstract={The development of social media has led to a burst of interest in image-related metadata information, such as tags and geo-tags. Tags are semantic keywords that are assigned to an image. Image tagging enables the users of social media sharing platforms to annotate images, facilitating image search and content description. Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes.

abstract={Collaborative Filtering systems consider users' social environment to predict what each user may like to visit in a social network i.e. they collect and analyze a large amount of information on users' behavior, activities or preferences and then predict or make suggestions to users. These systems use ranks or tags each user assign to different resources to make predictions. Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents, tag, organize, share and search for contents, are becoming more popular. These social tagging systems have a lot of valuable information, but the data expansion in them is very fast and this has led to the need for recommender systems that will predict what each user may like or need make these suggestions to them. One of the problems in these systems is: “how much can we rely on the similar users, are they trustworthy?”. In this article we use trust metric, which we conclude from users' tagging behavior, beside similarities to give suggestions. Results show considering trust in a collaborative system can lead to better performance in generating suggestions.},

However, POIs are usually favored by or suitable for different kinds of groups, such as a small group, a tight group, or a close group. In this paper, we propose an approach to discovering POI signatures from geo-social networking data. For each POI, we first discover whether it has been visited by any groups of people and the features of these groups from user trajectories. We then generate the signature for each POI based on the discovered group features. We conduct experiments on the real data of the check-in records from Bright kite, and show the various kinds of POI signatures we found.},

year={2013},

pages={117-126},
abstract={With the growth of location-based services and social services, low-sampling-rate trajectories from check-in data or photos with geo-tag information becomes ubiquitous. In general, most detailed moving information in low-sampling-rate trajectories are lost. Prior works have elaborated on distant-time location prediction in high-sampling-rate trajectories. However, existing prediction models are pattern-based and thus not applicable due to the sparsity of data points in low-sampling-rate trajectories. For example, it becomes difficult to derive trajectory patterns, let alone utilizing trajectory patterns for distant-time location prediction. In this paper, given a query time, the current location and time, we aim to predict the location of an object at the query time. To address the sparsity in low-sampling-rate trajectories, we develop a Reachability-based prediction model on Time-constrained Mobility Graph (abbreviated as RTMG) to predict locations for distant-time queries. Specifically, we design an adaptive temporal exploration approach to extract effective supporting trajectories that are temporally close to the query time. These data points are then represented as a Time-constrained user mobility Graph (refers to as TG). In light of TG, we further derive the reachability probabilities among locations in TG. Thus, a location with maximum reachability from the current location among all possible locations in supporting trajectories is considered as the prediction result. To efficiently process queries, we proposed an index structure SOIT to organize location records for on-line query processing. We conduct extensive experiments on real low-sampling-rate datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RTMG.},

abstract={Graphs are a fundamental data structure and have been employed to model objects as well as their relationships. The similarity of objects on the web (e.g., webpages, photos, music, micro-blogs, and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects in many recent applications. SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes.},

abstract={With the increase of resource-sharing social Web-sites like Flicker, YouTube, del.icio.us, Personalized Search becomes more imperative and challenging, as users demand higher retrieval quality. A social sharing websites is a developed online website service which enables users to add, share, annotate, and tag images. A large -scale user generated metadata that describes and gives information about other data and not only facilitate users in sharing and organizing multimedia contents but provide useful information to improve Media Retrieval, Unlimited backup and Management. A Personalized Image search tracks a registered user's log history, and then adjusts the search results based upon the interests, preferences and information needs of users. Personalized Image search differs from general Image Search, which returns identical search results to all users for identical queries, regardless of varied user interests and information needs. In this paper we exploit the Social annotations and Novel Framework for considering the user query relevance and user specific-topic to learn personalized image search. The proposed framework contains two techniques: 1) Utility and Prediction model for social annotations. 2) We introduce a Hit Matrix technique for user query relevance and preference into the specific topic space. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed method outperforms the existing method and also shows that the developed model demonstrates the effectives of the Personalized Image Search},

pages={934-940},
abstract={It is often essential for people to consult with others and ask them about their past experience and thoughts when making choices. Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social book marking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social book marking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data.},

pages={1270-1274},
abstract={With the expansion of e-commerce, recommender systems are drawing more and more attentions. Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular algorithm used for recommendation, but it performs not very well for sparse data and new users. The emergence of trust-based recommender system has solved the problem of CF in a better way. A system of this kind is commonly constructed based upon social network with trust relations. It contains not only user-item rating relations, but also friendships between users, and the friendships are very meaningful in recommendation. However, the trust values in the networks are all specified by users, which are subjective processes. In this paper, we propose a Top-K recommender system on social tagging network, and design a user-item rating matrix construction method on user browsed or searched information. We use tags, which can be regarded as users and items feature information, to compute the similarity between users or items. Moreover, we propose a Top-K recommender system construction method on the network with trust values computed from users' interest similarity. In our experiments we use the Last fm dataset, and we employ the RMSE and hit-radios benchmarks to evaluate the quality and performance of prediction on single item and Top-K recommendation. We compare our approach with two traditional CF algorithms. The experimental results show that our system has good performance, and it solves the defects of CF and existing Trust-based recommender systems.},

pages={570-581},
abstract={An understanding of information flow has many applications, including for maximizing marketing impact on social media, limiting malware propagation, and managing undesired disclosure of sensitive information. This paper presents scalable methods for both learning models of information flow in networks from data, based on the Independent Cascade Model, and predicting probabilities of unseen flow from these models. Our approach is based on a principled probabilistic construction and results compare favourably with existing methods in terms of accuracy of prediction and scalable evaluation, with the addition that we are able to evaluate a broader range of queries than previously shown, including probability of joint and/or conditional flow, as well as reflecting model uncertainty. Exact evaluation of flow probabilities is exponential in the number of edges and naive sampling can also be expensive, so we propose sampling in an efficient Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo fashion using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm -- details described in the paper. We identify two types of data, those where the paths of past flows are known -- attributed data, and those where only the endpoints are known -- unattributed data. Both data types are addressed in this paper, including training methods, example real world data sets, and experimental evaluation. In particular, we investigate flow data from the Twitter microblogging service, exploring the flow of messages through retweets (tweet forwards) for the attributed case, and the propagation of hash tags (metadata tags) and urls for the unattributed case.},

abstract={The widespread adoption of social media for political communication creates unprecedented opportunities to monitor the opinions of large numbers of politically active individuals in real time. However, without a way to distinguish between users of opposing political alignments, conflicting signals at the individual level may, in the aggregate, obscure partisan differences in opinion that are important to political strategy. In this article we describe several methods for predicting the political alignment of Twitter users based on the content and structure of their political communication in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. Using a data set of 1,000 manually-annotated individuals, we find that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on hash tag metadata outperforms an SVM trained on the full text of users' tweets, yielding predictions of political affiliations with 91% accuracy. Applying latent semantic analysis to the content of users' tweets we identify hidden structure in the data strongly associated with political affiliation, but do not find that topic detection improves prediction performance. All of these content-based methods are outperformed by a classifier based on the segregated community structure of political information diffusion networks (95% accuracy). We conclude with a practical application of this machinery to web-based political advertising, and outline several approaches to public opinion monitoring based on the techniques developed herein.},

Social tags have become widely used in web applications which not only reflect the user's personality but also item's properties and semantic meanings. We design an algorithmic framework by extending item-based collaborative filtering with social tags which we call IBeST. IBeST contains the whole lifecycle of the item similarity measurement based on social tags and improves item-based algorithmic results in four phases: dataset preprocessing, metadata injection, algorithm selection and optimization, and similarity weight selection. The calculated similarity is then used in item-based algorithm. MovieLens 10M ratings 100k tags dataset is used in our experiment. IBeST generates improved recommendation ratings than baseline item-based algorithms, and provides a feasible and loosely coupled solution to use social tags in item-based recommendation system.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks. Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost.},

abstract={We describe a semantic imitation model of social tagging that integrates formal representations of semantics and a stochastic tag choice process to explain and predict emergent behavioral patterns. The model adopts a probabilistic topic model to separately represent external word-topic and internal word-concept relations. These representations are coupled with a tag-based topic inference process that predicts how existing tags may influence the semantic interpretation of a document. The inferred topics influence the choice of tags assigned to a document through a random utility model of tag choices. We show that the model is successful in explaining the stability in tag proportions across time and power-law frequency-rank distributions of tag co-occurrences for semantically general and narrow tags. The model also generates novel predictions on how emergent behavioral patterns may change when users with different domain expertise interact with a social tagging system. The model demonstrates the weaknesses of single-level analyses and highlights the importance of adopting a multi-level modeling approach to explain online social behavior.},

pages={1456-1459},
abstract={Online social networking sites such as Flickr and Facebook provide a diverse range of functionalities that foster online communities to create and share media content. In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

abstract={Tagging and social networks have come into increasing use in concert with the rise of collaborative and interactive on-line media. The focus of tagging is herein twofold: First of all the plain annotation of existing data by a governing instance in order to increase the semantic content of unstructured data, and secondly the application of such meta-information by a community or a group of like minded users. The information contained in such social tagging reflects the point of view and understanding of the community, presenting a valuable source of information for the discovery of community structure,content and intent. This paper proposes an approach aimed at the use of community based tagging to address problems in link prediction and the discovery of complex user groups in a fleeting and unstructured Web-based environment. The ideas presented in this paper are applied to a real world scenario, and the results show a distinct opportunity in community detection and support.

In this paper we hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that in order to increase tag prediction accuracy, the granularity of each user model has to be adapted to the level of usage of each particular user. We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

year={2017},

abstract={Recommender systems provide users with content they might be interested in. Conventionally, recommender systems are evaluated mostly by using prediction accuracy metrics only. But the ultimate goal of a recommender system is to increase user satisfaction. Therefore, evaluations that measure user satisfaction should also be performed before deploying a recommender system in a real target environment. Such evaluations are laborious and complicated compared to the traditional, data-centric evaluations, though. In this study, we carried out a user-centric evaluation of state-of-the-art recommender systems as well as a graph-based approach in the ecologically valid setting of an authentic social learning platform. We also conducted a data-centric evaluation on the same data to investigate the added value of user-centric evaluations and how user satisfaction of a recommender system is related to its performance in terms of accuracy metrics. Our findings suggest that user-centric evaluation results are not necessarily in line with data-centric evaluation results. We conclude that the traditional evaluation of recommender systems in terms of prediction accuracy only does not suffice to judge performance of recommender systems on the user side. Moreover, the user-centric evaluation provides valuable insights in how candidate algorithms perform on each of the five quality metrics for recommendations: usefulness, accuracy, novelty, diversity, and serendipity.},

abstract={YouTube, with millions of content creators, has become the preferred destination for viewing videos online. Through the Partner program, YouTube allows content creators to monetize their popular videos. Of significant importance for content creators is which meta-level features (title, tag, thumbnail, and description) are most sensitive for promoting video popularity. The popularity of videos also depends on the social dynamics, i.e., the interaction of the content creators (or channels) with YouTube users. Using real-world data consisting of about 6 million videos spread over 25 thousand channels, we empirically examine the sensitivity of YouTube meta-level features and social dynamics. The key meta-level features that impact the view counts of a video include: first day view count, number of subscribers, contrast of the video thumbnail, Google hits, number of keywords, video category, title length, and number of upper-case letters in the title, respectively, and illustrate that these meta-level features can be used to estimate the popularity of a video. In addition, optimizing the meta-level features after a video is posted increases the popularity of videos. In the context of social dynamics, we discover that there is a causal relationship between views to a channel and the associated number of subscribers. Additionally, insights into the effects of scheduling and video playthrough in a channel are also provided. Our findings provide a useful understanding of user engagement in YouTube.},

title={Forecasting the Subway Passenger Flow Under Event Occurrences With Social Media},

pages={1623-1632},
abstract={Subway passenger flow prediction is strategically important in metro transit system management. The prediction under event occurrences turns into a very challenging task. In this paper, we adopt a new kind of data source-social media-to tackle this challenge. We develop a systematic approach to examine social media activities and sense event occurrences. Our initial analysis demonstrates that there exists a moderate positive correlation between passenger flow and the rates of social media posts. This finding motivates us to develop a novel approach for improved flow forecast. We first develop a hashtag-based event detection algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a parametric and convex optimization-based approach, called optimization and prediction with hybrid loss function (OPL), to fuse the linear regression and the results of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model jointly. The OPL hybrid model takes advantage of the unique strengths of linear correlation in social media features and SARIMA model in time series prediction. Experiments on events nearby a subway station show that OPL reports the best forecasting performance compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, an ensemble model is developed to leverage the weighted results from OPL and support vector machine regression together. As a result, the prediction accuracy and the robustness further increase.},

title={A Location- and Diversity-Aware News Feed System for Mobile Users},
year={2016},
volume={9},
number={6},
pages={846-861},
abstract={A location-aware news feed (LANF) system generates news feeds for a mobile user based on her spatial preference (i.e., her current location and future locations) and non-spatial preference (i.e., her interest). Existing LANF systems simply send the most relevant geo-tagged messages to their users. Unfortunately, the major limitation of such an existing approach is that, a news feed may contain messages related to the same location (i.e., point-of-interest) or the same category of locations (e.g., food, entertainment or sport). We argue that diversity is a very important feature for location-aware news feeds because it helps users discover new places and activities. In this paper, we propose D-MobiFeed; a new LANF system enables a user to specify the minimum number of message categories (h) for the messages in a news feed. In D-MobiFeed, our objective is to efficiently schedule news feeds for a mobile user at her current and predicted locations, such that (i) each news feed contains messages belonging to at least h different categories, and (ii) their total relevance to the user is maximized. To achieve this objective, we formulate the problem into two parts, namely, a decision problem and an optimization problem. For the decision problem, we provide an exact solution by modeling it as a maximum flow problem and proving its correctness. The optimization problem is solved by our proposed three-stage heuristic algorithm. We conduct a user study and experiments to evaluate the performance of D-MobiFeed using a real data set crawled from Foursquare. Experimental results show that our proposed three-stage heuristic scheduling algorithm outperforms the brute-force optimal algorithm by at least an order of magnitude in terms of running time and the relative error incurred by the heuristic algorithm is below 1 percent. D-MobiFeed with the location prediction method effectively improves the relevance, diversity, and efficiency of news feeds.},

abstract={Context-aware recommendations offer the potential of exploiting social contents and utilize related tags and rating information to personalize the search for content considering a given context. Recommendation systems tackle the problem of trying to identify relevant resources from the vast number of choices available online. In this study, we propose a new recommendation model that personalizes recommendations and improves the user experience by analyzing the context when a user wishes to access multimedia content. We conducted empirical analysis on a dataset from last.fm to demonstrate the use of latent preferences for ranking items under a given context.

Previous research has shed light on the challenges that contextualizing effects and linguistic complexities pose for the accurate sentiment classification of tweets. We test the effect of adding manually-annotated, corpus-based hashtags to a sentiment lexicon, finding that this step in combination with negation detection increases prediction accuracy by about 7%.

pages={559-564},
abstract={By the appearance of the online social networks, ordinary people have gained more chance to make and publish content. However, for audiences, as the number of these shared contents grows, the importance of detecting important and related ones increases. So, a significant question is how much would a shared content become popular among audiences, regardless of the source of content? In this paper, we investigate this question by performing a comprehensive analysis of tweet content and studying its impact on popularity of tweet. Here, the number of retweets of tweet is used as a popularity measure. We show that tweets with “social” content, have in general more chance of popularity due to their attraction for society. In contrast, tweets with “individual” content, have little chance to get popular. We collect a fair data set of tweets. In order to do more detailed investigation and access the semantic features, we set an annotation and labeling process. We analyze the informativeness of content-based features and use them to train predictive models. The results clearly show the importance of content-based features. They specifically support this idea that specifying whether a tweet is speaking about an individual or social subject, is the most informative content-based feature to predict the popularity i.e. the number of retweets.},

abstract={Social media interactions have become increasingly important in today's world. A survey conducted in 2014 among adult Americans found that a majority of those surveyed use at least one social media site. Twitter, in particular, serves 310 million active users on a monthly basis, and thousands of tweets are published every second. The public nature of this data makes it a prime candidate for data mining. Twitter users publish 140-character long messages and have the ability to geo-tag these tweets using a variety of methods: GPS coordinates, IP geolocation and user-declared location. However, few users disclose their location, only between 1% and 3% of users provide location data, according to our empirical findings. In this article, we aim to aggregate information from different sources to provide an estimation on the location of any Twitter user. We use an hybrid approach, using techniques in the fields of Natural Language Processing and network theory. Tests have been conducted on two datasets, inferring the location of each individual user and then comparing it against the actual known location of users with geolocation information. The estimation error is the distance in kilometers between the estimation and the actual location. Furthermore, there is a comparison of the relative average error per country, to account for difference in country sizes. Our results improve those presented in different researches in the literature. Our research has as feature to be independent of the language used by the user, while most of works in the literature use just one language or a reduced set of languages. The article also showcases the evolution of our estimation approach and the impact that the modifications had on the results.},

pages={1329-1334},
abstract={The paper presents deep learning models for tweets binary classification. Our approach is based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and hence expects to be able to capture long-term dependencies among words. We develop two models for tweets classification. The basic model, called LSTM-TC, takes word embeddings as input, uses the LSTM layer to derive semantic tweet representation, and applies logistic regression to predict tweet label. The basic LSTM-TC model, like other deep learning models, requires a large amount of well-labeled training data to achieve good performance. To address this challenge, we further develop an improved model, called LSTM-TC*, that incorporates a large amount of weakly-labeled data for classifying tweets. We present two approaches of constructing the weakly-labeled data. One is based on hashtag information and the other is based on the prediction output of some traditional classifier that does not need a large amount of well-labeled training data. Our LSTM-TC* model first learns tweet representation based on the weakly-labeled data, and then trains the logistic regression classifier based on the small amount of well-labeled data. Experimental results show that: (1) the proposed method can be successfully used for tweets classification and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, (2) pre-training tweet representation, which utilizes weakly-labeled tweets, can significantly improve the accuracy of tweets classification.},

abstract={The creation of social ties is driven by several factors which can arguably be related to individual preferences and to the common social environment of individuals. Effects of homophily and triadic closure mechanisms are claimed to be important in terms of initiating new social interactions and in turn to shape the global social structure. This way they eventually provide some potential to predict the creation of social ties between disconnected people sharing common friends or common subjects of interest. In this paper we analyze a large Twitter data corpus and quantify similarities between people by considering the set of their common friends and the set of their commonly shared hashtags in order to predict mention links among them. We show that these similarity measures are correlated among connected people and that the combination of contextual and local structural features provides better predictions as compared to cases where they are considered separately. These results help us to better understand the evolution of egocentric and global social networks and provide advances in the design of better recommendation systems and resource allocation plans.},

This paper presents a weakly supervised approach for stance detection in tweets based solely on their contents. The approach relies on a set of heuristics used to automatically label tweets with regard to stance, which has a twofold purpose: a) automatic creation of a training corpus to develop a predictive model using a supervised learning algorithm, and b) to complement the predictive model when determining the stance of tweets. The paper analyzes the performance of the approach considering six distinct stance targets. We achieved promising results, with weighted F-measure varying from 52% to 67%.},

abstract={Big Data consists of huge volume of complex growing data sets from several independent sources. With the rapid development of data collection and storage capacity, big data are expanding in all science and engineering domains. The most fundamental challenge for big data applications is to scrutinize the large amount of data and extract required information or knowledge for future usage which is beyond the limit of relational databases with respect to storage and processing of massive quantity of data. Intent of this paper is by considering the big data repository as Twitter, dynamically mine the recent tweets related to Kapoor and Sons movie and perform the data mining operation and analytics on it by overcoming the challenges categorized with respect to the HACE theorem. To handle the massive amount of tweets we have used Hadoop Map Reduce framework to perform data mining analytic operations such as data cleansing, data classification and data clustering. Prediction model for the movie review is built by using Naive Bayes Classifier and accuracy of the prediction is calculated with the help of binomial test as it conforms to the Bernoulli distribution. Clustering of Tweets are obtained on the basis of Location and Hash Tags. Additionally privacy for the user tweets are preserved by using Data mining anomaly Technique, results are displayed with the help of intelligent graphs. As a Performance Evaluation of Map Reduce, the predictive analysis is done by using Map Reduce as well as without using Map Reduce, based on the execution time comparison performance graph is obtained to prove Map Reduce is an Efficient framework for huge volume of data.},

abstract={The interactive behavior of Web users often makes some online contents more popular than others. Thus the popularity of online contents can help us understand public interest and attention behind user interactions. Modeling and predicting the popularity of online contents is an important research topic and can facilitate many practical applications in different domains. Previous work on popularity modeling and prediction usually treat each online content separately, and neglect the interaction information between online contents, represented as interaction relations. In this paper, we explore the interaction relations between online contents, specifically competition and cooperation relations, for popularity prediction. We first define the interaction relations between different online contents and propose a method for the calculation of interaction information. We then apply the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique to get a low dimensional representation of interaction features for online contents, which are used by classifiers for popularity prediction. We finally evaluate the proposed approach using two datasets from SinaWeibo (i.e., original tweets and topic hashtags). The experimental results show that interaction features alone can yield relatively good performance, and by incorporating interaction features into traditional feature based methods, our method can further improve popularity prediction results.},

abstract={This paper explores the social quality (goodness) of community structures formed across Twitter users, where social links within the structures are estimated based upon semantic properties of user-generated content (corpus). We examined the overlap of the community structures of the constructed graphs, and followership-based social communities, to find the social goodness of the links constructed. Unigram, bigram and LDA content models were empirically investigated for evaluation of effectiveness, as approximators of underlying social graphs, such that they maintain the community social property. Impact of content at varying granularities, for the purpose of predicting links while retaining the social community structures, was investigated. 100 discussion topics, spanning over 10 Twitter events, were used for experiments. The unigram language model performed the best, indicating strong similarity of word usage within deeply connected social communities. This observation agrees with the phenomenon of evolution of word usage behavior, that transform individuals belonging to the same community tending to choose the same words, made by [1], and raises a question on the literature that use, without validation, LDA for content-based social link prediction over other content models. Also, semantically finer-grained content was observed to be more effective compared to coarser-grained content.},

The widespread popularity of these platforms and the complex social structure that arises within these communities provides a unique opportunity to understand the interactions between users. The political domain, especially in a multi-party system, presents compelling challenges, as political parties have different levels of alignment based on their political strategies. We use Twitter to understand the nuanced relationships between differing political entities in Latin America. Our model incorporates diverse signals from the content of tweets and social context from retweets, mentions and hashtag usage. Since direct communications between entities are relatively rare, we explore models based on the posts of users who interact with multiple political organizations.

year={2016},
pages={852-859},
abstract={Social network is a hot topic of interest for the researchers in the field of computer science in recent years. The vast amount of data generated by these social networks play a very important role in information diffusion. Social network data are generated by its users. So, user's behavior and activities are being investigated by the researchers to get a logical view of social network platform. This research proposed a novel retweet prediction model which considers difference in user's behavior as an author (as reflected in the tweets) and a retweeter (as reflected in the retweets) and do the prediction accordingly. The proposed retweet prediction strategy taking this difference into consideration, gave better prediction accuracy than the conventional strategy. The findings of this research explains that in social networks, some users show different behavior indifferent roles and these differences may have impact on future research.},

title={Twitter analysis of road traffic congestion severity estimation},
year={2016},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Road traffic congestion is one of the problems in large cities. While Twitter has become a major means for communication and message dissemination among Internet users, one question that arises is whether Twitter messages alone can suggest road traffic congestion condition. This paper proposes a method to predict traffic congestion severity level based on the analysis of Twitter messages. Different types of tweets data are used to construct a C4.5 decision tree model for prediction, including tweets from selected road-traffic Twitter accounts, tweets that contain road-traffic-related keywords, and geo-tagged tweets whose volume suggests large crowds in certain areas. In the training that used tweets data of one of the top congested roads in Bangkok, density of tweets has high information gain in classifying congestion severity level. Via a web application, the model can provide a traveler with an estimate of the congestion severity level of the road at every 30 minutes. Such advance congestion information can help the traveler to make a better travel plan. In an evaluation using 10-fold cross validation, the model also shows good performance.},

abstract={The explosive popularity of social networking sites has provided an additional venue for online information seeking. By posting questions in their status updates, more and more people are turning to social networks to fulfill their information needs. Given that understanding individuals' information needs could improve the performance of question answering, in this paper, we model the task of intent detection as a binary classification problem, and thus for each question, two classes are defined: subjective and objective. We use a comprehensive set of lexical, syntactical, and contextual features to build the classifier and the experimental results show satisfactory classification performance. By applying the classifier on a larger dataset, we then present in-depth analyses to compare subjective and objective questions, in terms of the way they are being asked and answered. We find that the two types of questions exhibited very different characteristics, and further validate the expected benefits of differentiating questions according to their subjectivity orientations.},

abstract={When we refer to an image that attracts our attention, it is natural to mention not only what is literally depicted in the image, but also the sentiments, thoughts and opinions that it invokes in ourselves. In this work we deviate from the standard mainstream tasks of associating tags or keywords to an image, or generating content image descriptions, and we introduce the novel task of automatically generate user comments for an image. We present a new dataset collected from the social media Pinterest and we propose a strategy based on building joint textual and visual user models, tailored to the specificity of the mentioned task. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis of our approach on both qualitative and quantitative terms, which allows to assess the value of the proposed approach and shows its encouraging results against several existing image-to-text methods.},

title={Security attack prediction based on user sentiment analysis of Twitter data},
year={2016},
pages={610-617},
abstract={In recent years, security attacks on the web have been perpetrated by hacker activist organizations that aim to destabilize (using different techniques) web services in a specific context for which they are motivated. Predicting these attacks is an important task that helps to consider what actions should be taken if the attack is latent. Although there are applications to detect security threats on the web, currently there is no system that can predict or forecast whether the attacks can reach consummation. This paper presents a sentiment analysis method on Twitter content to predict future attacks on the web. The method is based on the daily collection of tweets from two sets of users; those who use the platform as a means of expression for views on relevant issues, and those who use it to present contents related to security attacks in the web. Daily information is converted into data that can be analysed statistically to predict whether there is a possibility of an attack. The latter is done by analyzing the collective sentiment of users and groups of hacking activists in response to a global event.},

abstract={The popularity of social media over the past several years, especially sites such as Twitter, has presented a network for up to the minute information on events across the globe. The information presented on these sites can be extremely helpful in the case of an emergency, however, the vast amount of data to examine and the low adoption of geo-tagging on this site makes it difficult, if not impossible, for emergency services to respond to information gathered from social media. Taking this into consideration, this paper presents a proof of concept for identifying and retrieving different geo-locations from Tweets and extracting the GPS coordinates from this data to approximately plot them in a map.},

pages={1959-1968},
abstract={This paper investigates the problem of predicting Twitter hashtags popularity level. A data set of more than 18 million tweets containing 748 thousand hashtags has been prepared by using Twitter's Streaming API. Early adoption properties including profile of tweet authors and adoption time series are used to predict a tag's later popularity level. The followers count and tweets count are two such characteristics related to adopters' profile. On the other hand, two types of frequency domain analyses are used to augment the simple mean and standard deviation characteristics of the adoption time series. Fourier transform (FT) spectrum and wavelet transform (WT) spectrum are considered in this study. Experimental results show that WT spectrum improves the prediction result of viral hashtags while FT spectrum does not.},

year={2015},
pages={741-744},
abstract={On Twitter, social capitalists use dedicated hashtags and mutual subscriptions to each other in order to gain followers and to be retweeted. Their methods are successful enough to make them appear as influent users. Indeed, applications dedicated to the influence measurement such as Klout and Kred give high scores to most of these users. Meanwhile, their high number of retweets and followers are not due to the relevance of the content they tweet, but to their social capitalism techniques. In order to be able to detect these users, we train a classifier using a dataset of social capitalists and regular users. We then implement this classifier in a web application that we call DDP. DDP allows users to test whether a Twitter account is a social capitalist or not and to visualize the data we use to make the prediction. DDP allows administrator to crawl data from a lot of users automatically. Furthermore, administrators can manually label Twitter accounts as social capitalists or regular users to add them into the dataset. Finally, administrators can train new classifiers in order to take into account the new Twitter accounts added to the dataset, and thus making evolve the classifier with these new recently collected data. The web application is thus a way to collect data, make evolve the knowledge about social capitalists and to keep detecting them efficiently.},

year={2015},
pages={1254-1261},
abstract={In the past years a lot of effort has been spent analyzing online social network data to understand how the world reality is reflected in the "virtual" world. Twitter is by far the network most used in these studies, given its policy of public data availability. However, a big discussion is still on on whether the data available is enough to make user characterization or event outcomes prediction, and what are the pitfalls people do not usually account for. In this direction, we propose a new methodology for drawing representative samples from Twitter data, which is divided into four phases: (i) user filtering, (ii) user demographic characterization, (iii) user sampling, and (iv) event prediction. The methodology is tested into a common scenario in Twitter event outcome prediction: elections. The methodology was tested with municipality elections from six different Brazilian cities, and compared to official election results. Results show it is worth further investigating the topic, but that a very hight number of messages is required to match real data distributions.},

year={2015},
pages={1269-1276},
abstract={The question that whether Twitter data can be leveraged to forecast outcome of the elections has always been of great anticipation in the research community. Existing research focuses on leveraging content analysis for positivity or negativity analysis of the sentiments of opinions expressed. This is while, analysis of link structure features of social networks underlying the conversation involving politicians has been less looked. The intuition behind such study comes from the fact that density of conversations about parties along with their respective members, whether explicit or implicit, should reflect on their popularity. On the other hand, dynamism of interactions, can capture the inherent shift in popularity of accounts of politicians. Within this manuscript we present evidence of how a well-known link prediction algorithm, can reveal an authoritative structural link formation within which the popularity of the political accounts along with their neighbourhoods, shows strong correlation with the standing of electoral outcomes. As an evidence, the public time-lines of two electoral events from 2014 elections of Sweden on Twitter have been studied. By distinguishing between member and official party accounts, we report that even using a focus-crawled public dataset, structural link popularities bear strong statistical similarities with vote outcomes. In addition we report strong ranked dependence between standings of selected politicians and general election outcome, as well as for official party accounts and European election outcome.},
