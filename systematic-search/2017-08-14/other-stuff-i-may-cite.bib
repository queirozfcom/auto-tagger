  abstract = {As cross-lingual information retrieval is attracting increasing attention, tools that measure cross-lingual semantic similarity between documents are becoming desirable. In this paper, two aspects of cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated: One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then, Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.},

  abstract  = {Tagging is used for annotating and categorizing documents, and facilitating information retrieval. Users use tags freely to express their views of the provided content. This freedom allows the user to use any language in tagging. This can be considered as an aid for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) since it can help retrieve documents and other contents from different languages other than the query language. This paper investigates the use of Arabic tags in del.icio.us and analyzes the role they play in CLIR.},

In this paper, we implement user-based CF algorithm on a cloud computing platform, namely Hadoop, to solve the scalability problem of CF. Experimental results show that a simple method that partition users into groups according to two basic principles, i.e., tidy arrangement of mapper number to overcome the initiation of mapper and partition task equally such that all processors finish task at the same time, can achieve linear speedup.},

  abstract      = {Recently, collaborative tagging has been gaining increasing popularity in a large variety of websites. The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Social book marking services allow users sharing similar interests to save and exchange web content they find useful or relevant. Book marking is especially important for content not located by the top ranked web pages or easily explored with a traditional search engine. This study investigated the effects that the major context of use (work vs. non-work) has had on experiences with the social book marking service. A within-subject experiment was conducted with 77 subjects. Each took part in both work and non-work information tasks by interacting with six navigation aids. The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues. Understanding how users interact with various way finding cues can enlighten design considerations for refining social navigation functions. For social book marking service providers, the findings of this study offer new insights into user-centered design from an information interaction perspective.},

  abstract  = {A scheme for identifying the semantic layers of music-related tags is presented. Arguments are provided why the applications of the tags cannot be effectively pursued without a reasonable understanding of their semantic qualities. The identification scheme consists of a set of filters. The first is related with social consensus, user-count ratio, and n-gram properties of tags. The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out with an independent, smaller hand-annotated dataset, in which high agreement between the identification provided by the scheme and annotations was found.},
