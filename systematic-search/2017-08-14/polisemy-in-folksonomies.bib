  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy. One problem offolksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task. © 2007 IEEE.},

For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model.

This paper presents a novel method that overcomes this problem by automatically generating an annotated corpus based on a specific ontology. Then the corpus was enriched with new and informative features extracted from Wikipedia data. Moreover, rather than pursuing rule-based methods as in literature, we employ a machine learning model to not only disambiguate but also identify named entities. In addition, our method explores in details the use of a range of features extracted from texts, a given ontology, and Wikipedia data for disambiguation. This paper also systematically analyzes impacts of the features on disambiguation accuracy by varying their combinations for representing named entities. Empirical evaluation shows that, while the ontology provides basic features of named entities, Wikipedia is a fertile source for additional features to construct accurate and robust named entity disambiguation systems.},

Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keywordbased and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords. © 2008 IEEE.},

While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system.

Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging applications have become a popular tool allowing Internet users to manage online resources with tags. Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

While collaborative tagging offers many advantages over the use of controlled vocabularies, they also suffer from problems such as the existence of polysemous tags. We investigate how the different contexts in which individual tags are used can be revealed automatically without consulting any external resources. We consider several different network representations of tags and documents, and apply a graph clustering algorithm on these networks to obtain groups of tags or documents corresponding to the different meanings of an ambiguous tag. Our experiments show that networks which explicitly take the social context into account are more likely to give a better picture of the semantics of a tag. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents an in-depth study of the social tagging mechanisms used in Freesound.org, an online community where users share and browse audio files by means of tags and content-based audio similarity search. We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

  abstract  = {Tagging is one of the most popular services in Web 2.0. As a special form of tagging, social tagging is done collaboratively by many users, which forms a so-called folksonomy. As tagging has become widespread on the Web, the tag vocabulary is now very informal, uncontrolled, and personalized. For this reason, many tags are unfamiliar and ambiguous to users so that they fail to understand the meaning of each tag. In this paper, we propose a tag sense disambiguating method, called tag sense disambiguation (TSD), which works in the social tagging environment. TSD can be applied to the vocabulary of social tags, thereby enabling users to understand the meaning of each tag through Wikipedia. To find the correct mappings from del.icio.us tags to Wikipedia articles, we define the local neighbor tags, the global neighbor tags, and finally the neighbor tags that would be the useful key-words for disambiguating the sense of each tag based on the tag co-occurrences. The automatically built mappings are reasonable in most cases. The experiment shows that TSD can find the correct mappings with high accuracy.},
