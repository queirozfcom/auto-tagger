  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy. One problem offolksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems have nowadays become important data sources for populating semantic web applications. For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

  abstract        = {Information on Web2.0, generated by users of web based services, is both difficult to organize and organic in nature. Content categorization and search in such situation offers challenging scenarios. The primary means of content categorization in such social services is folk-sonomy or collaborative tagging. During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model. The results of the study are analyzed and future directions along this path of research are presented.},
