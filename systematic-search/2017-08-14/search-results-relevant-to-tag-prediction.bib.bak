  abstract  = {Equipping an imaginary Random Surfer of the Web with the ability to teleport, was Page et al.'s creative way to justify a mathematical necessity; the Teleportation Matrix. Despite being essential for ensuring the ergodicity of the underlying Markov chain, the standard definition of this matrix treats the nodes of the graph in a simplistic and “leveling” way that can prove counterintuitive - especially for applications of the method on graphs of heterogeneous data. In this work, we focus on such graphs and we propose a novel alternative teleportation model that yields a well-defined ranking vector, while being as easy to handle as the traditional teleportation. We explore the theoretical implications of our model, and we reveal a wealth of nice properties that result to direct computational advantages over PageRank. We conduct a set of experiments using real-world datasets and we verify both the useful computational characteristics of our model and its favorable qualitative performance. Our promising findings suggest there remain more to be explored, and maybe much to be gained, by revisiting the teleportation model; a neglected part of PageRank that is typically taken for granted by the majority of applications in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Bud Burst Mobile is a smart phone application for an environmental Participatory Sensing project that focuses on observing plants and collecting plant life stage data. The app was initially designed for record-keeping and motivation to participate in this project has been based on improving scientific knowledge. To test other methods for motivating data collection and increasing user retention, we added an outdoor game activity, similar to geocaching, called flora caching. Players gain points and levels within the game by finding and making qualitative observations on plants. Location-based information is included in the game with the display of local lists of plant species occurring in a user's area derived from governmental data sources. Additionally, user-collected data and the occurrence of species on the local lists obtained from the photo-sharing website Flickr are displayed on an interactive map. Administrator targeting of individual plants facilitates expert control over crowd-sourced data collection for species of interest. We evaluated these additional features with the help of 50 volunteers playing on the UCLA campus as a case study. Results indicated that participants were highly motivated by the flora caching game, and next-most by the knowledge that environmental scientists will use the data collected for studying the effects of global climate change. Other motivating features included sharing plant observations with other users and the information contained in the local lists of plants.},

Tags have been extensively used to organize and index mashup services. However, people favor manual tags creation in the past. This approach demands user intervention, which is extremely time-consuming and probes to errors. In this paper we propose a novel Mashup-API-Tag model for automatic mashup tag recommendation. The model simultaneously incorporates the composition relationships between mashups and APIs as well as the annotation relationships between APIs and tags to discover the latent topics. Then the semantic similarity between Web APIs and mashups can be acquired. Subsequently, tags of chosen APIs are recommended to a mashup where the mashup and the APIs are most similar. In addition, we develop a tag filtering algorithm to select the most relevant tags for recommendation. The experimental results on a real world dataset prove that our approach outperforms other methods, including frequency-based methods and the methods that only consider the composition relationships and the annotation relationships separately.},

Based on Ames's theoretical framework on motivation, we propose a model for knowledge contribution in problem-solving virtual communities (PSVCs). The model includes two second-order individual motivations, with four major mechanisms in PSVCs that are associated with these motivations. Results confirm that only egoistic motives affect members' knowledge contribution in PSVCs. Further, knowledge repository and social identity are found to be important mechanisms for promoting knowledge contribution through egoistic motives.

  abstract = {Given a collection of web images with the corresponding textual descriptions, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain learning method to classify these web multimedia objects by transferring the correlation knowledge among different information sources. Here, the knowledge is extracted from unlabeled objects through unsupervised learning and applied to perform supervised classification tasks. To mine more meaningful correlation knowledge, instead of using commonly used visual words in the traditional bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, we discover higher level visual components (words and phrases) to incorporate the spatial and semantic information into our image representation model, i.e., bag-of-visual-phrases (BoP). By combining the enriched visual components with the textual words, we calculate the frequently co-occurring pairs among them to construct a cross-domain correlated graph in which the correlation knowledge is mined. After that, we investigate two different strategies to apply such knowledge to enrich the feature space where the supervised classification is performed. By transferring such knowledge, our cross-domain transfer learning method can not only handle large scale web multimedia objects, but also deal with the situation that the textual descriptions of a small portion of web images are missing. Empirical experiments on two different datasets of web multimedia objects are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain transfer learning method.},

Searching a hash tag simply shows a list of tweets, each contains the query hash tag string. To find even more relevant hash tags, we propose to use a graph-based approach to find similar hash tags by using the social network graph around hash tags. We start by using a heterogeneous social graph that contains users, tweets, and hash tags, then we summarize the graph to a hash tag graph that shows the similarity between different hash tags. Finally, we rank the vertices in respect to a query hash tag using a random walk with restart and a content similarity measure. The experimental work demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to baselines.},

Moreover, the coupling scheme is also an efficient tool to investigate various aspects of the influence propagation on multiple OSNs. The extensive experiments on real-world and synthesized datasets not only confirm the quality of the solution but also reveal interesting insights into the behavior of influence propagation in and across the networks.},

  abstract  = {In tag-word disambiguation, a word is assigned to a specific context chosen among the different ones to which it is related. Relatedness to a context is often defined based on the co-occurrence of the target word with other words (context words) in sentences of a specific corpus. The overall disambiguation process can be thought as a classification process, where the context words play the role of features for the target. A problem with this approach is that the large number of possible context words can reduce the classification performance, both in terms of computational effort and in terms of quality of the outcome. Feature selection can improve the process in both regards, by reducing the overall feature space to a manageable size with high information content. In this work we propose to use, in disambiguation, a feature selection approach based on the Shapley Value (SV) - a Coalitional Game Theory related metrics, measuring the importance of a component within a coalition. By including in the feature set only the words with the highest Shapley Value, we obtain remarkable quality and performance improvements. The problem of the exponential complexity in the exact SV computation is avoided by an approximate computation based on sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and of the sampling approach results, by using both a synthetic language corpus and a real world linguistic corpus.},

The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.},

It is motivated by the applications which need to monitoring and analyzing the social activities of the employees from a given company, especially their social tracks related to the work and business. It definitely helps to better understand their needs and opinions towards certain business area, so that the account sales targeting these customers in the given company can adjust the sales strategies accordingly. Specifically, in this task we are given a snapshot of a social network and some labeled social users who are the employees of a given company. Our goal is to identify more users from the same company. We formulate this problem as a task of classifying nodes over a graph, and develop a Supervised Label Propagation model. It naturally incorporates the rich set of features for social activities, models the networking effect by label propagation, and learns the feature weights so that the labels are propagated to the right users. To validate its effectiveness, we show our case studies on identifying the employees of "China Telecom" and "China Unicom" from Sina Weibo. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the compared baseline ones.},

Semantic information is needed for many complex tasks like concept extraction and information integration.

At the core of semantic extraction is the identification of concepts and relationships that are present in the data. We show, through an experimental study on tagged photographs, how to extract concepts associated with photographs and their relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to extract a concept associated with a photograph with an overall precision score of 80%. Our experiments also show that a variation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient on sets of tags can be used to determine equivalence relationships between the concepts associated with these sets.},

  abstract  = {The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

We contribute a novel perspective on this historical trend with our Coordination Pyramid, a framework that recognizes four distinct paradigms of coordination and classifies coordination technologies according to which paradigm they primarily support. Although historical in its construction, the Pyramid has strong implications for both current practice and future re-search directions. With respect to practice, the Pyramid helps organizations in identifying and articulating future coordination needs, mismatches that exist between these needs and the portfolio of coordination tools presently in use, and solution strategies for addressing these mismatches. With respect to research, the Pyramid clearly highlights several trends in how tools have historically evolved and can be anticipated to evolve in future.},

However, these tags are often imprecise and incomplete, which essentially limits tag-based image indexing and related applications. To tackle this issue, we propose an image retagging scheme that aims at refining the quality of the tags. The retagging process is formulated as a multiple graph-based multi-label learning problem, which simultaneously explores the visual content of the images, semantic correlation of the tags as well as the prior information provided by users. Different from classical single graph-based multi-label learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm propagates the information of each tag along an individual tag-specific similarity graph, which reflects the particular relationship among the images with respect to the specific tag and at the same time the propagations of different tags interact with each other in a collaborative way with an extra tag similarity graph. In particular, we present a robust tag-specific visual sub-vocabulary learning algorithm for the construction of those tag-specific graphs. Experimental results on two benchmark Flickr image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image retagging scheme. We also show the remarkable performance improvements brought by retagging in the task of image ranking.},

Often such data comes with expressive node and edge labels that allow an interpretation as a semantic graph, and edge weights that reflect the strengths of semantic relations between entities. Finding close relationships between a given set of two, three, or more entities is an important building block for many search, ranking, and analysis tasks. From an algorithmic point of view, this translates into computing the best Steiner trees between the given nodes, a classical NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a new approximation algorithm, coined STAR, for relationship queries over large relationship graphs. We prove that for n query entities, STAR yields an O(log(n))-approximation of the optimal Steiner tree in pseudopolynomial run-time, and show that in practical cases the results returned by STAR are qualitatively comparable to or even better than the results returned by a classical 2-approximation algorithm. We then describe an extension to our algorithm to return the top-k Steiner trees. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm over both main-memory as well as completely diskresident graphs containing millions of nodes. Our experiments show that in terms of efficiency STAR outperforms the best state-of-the-art database methods by a large margin, and also returns qualitatively better results.},

To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.},

For example, experiments show that 58% of the selected ads are among the top 5 most relevant ads in a pool of 64 candidate ads.},

  abstract  = {One of the goals of mobile and ubiquitous computing is to enable ad-hoc interactions between different kinds of entities to help end-users perform different kinds of tasks. These entities, which include devices and services, may either be mobile or situated in the surrounding physical environment. However, these interactions require the use of rich semantic models describing the capabilities of the entities, the data exchanged between them and the desires of end-users. These semantic models enable the discovery of entities that satisfy certain constraints as well as the composition of different entities into applications for performing different kinds of tasks. In this paper, we describe two models that we have used in our systems for describing data and entities. The first model is based on OWL ontologies, where all data is described by a set of OWL facts, and component inputs and outputs are described using RDF graph patterns. The second model is based on folksonomies, where all data is described by a set of tags, and component inputs and outputs are also described using sets of tags. The two models have very different properties in terms of expressiveness and ease of use. We present our experiences in using these models for discovery of entities and for the automatic composition of complex flows in response to dynamic end-user goals. We also describe some of the future challenges that lay in the path of semantically-enabled ad-hoc interactions.},

  abstract = {As requirements of organisations change, so do the software systems within them. When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.},

  abstract  = {The name ambiguity problem is a challenge in many areas, especially in the field of bibliographic digital libraries. For example, in services that use citation data to compute the impact of authors, ambiguous names lead to biased measures. The problem is amplified where names are collected from heterogeneous sources, including crowd sourced annotations. This is the case in the Scholaro meter system, which cross-correlates author names in user queries with those retrieved from bibliographic data. The uncontrolled nature of user-generated annotations is very valuable, but creates the need to detect ambiguous names. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect ambiguous names at query time, which makes it applicable in the context of a social computing application. We explore two kinds of heuristic features based on citations and crowd sourced topics. Our approach can detect ambiguous author names in crowd sourced scholarly data with an accuracy of 75%.},

Most prior works have explored two learning strategies independently for domain adaptation: feature matching and instance reweighting. In this paper, we show that both strategies are important and inevitable when the domain difference is substantially large. We therefore put forward a novel Transfer Joint Matching (TJM) approach to model them in a unified optimization problem. Specifically, TJM aims to reduce the domain difference by jointly matching the features and reweighting the instances across domains in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is invariant to both the distribution difference and the irrelevant instances. Comprehensive experimental results verify that TJM can significantly outperform competitive methods for cross-domain image recognition problems.},

While any one individual may not provide sufficient samples, aggregating samples across many individuals provides high-quality, high-coverage measurements of the phenomena. Thus, for participatory sensing to be successful, one must motivate a large number of individuals to participate. In this work, we review a variety of incentive mechanisms that motivate people to contribute to a CS effort. We then establish a set of design constraints or minimum requirements that any incentive mechanism for CS must have. These design constrains are then used as metrics to evaluate those approaches and determine their advantages and disadvantages. We also contribute a taxonomy of CS incentive mechanisms and show how current systems fit within this taxonomy. We conclude with the identification of new types of incentive mechanisms that require further investigation.},

This research presents a novel technique for item recommendation within social networks that matches user and group interests over time. Users often tag items in social networks with words and phrases that reflect their preferred "vocabulary." As such, these tags provide succinct descriptions of the resource, implicitly reveal user preferences, and, as the tag vocabulary of users tends to change over time, reflect the dynamics of user preferences. Based on evaluation of user and group interests over time, we present a recommendation system employing a modified latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model in which users and tags associated with an item are represented and clustered by topics, and the topic-based representation is combined with the item's timestamp to show time-based topic distribution. By representing users via topics, the model can cluster users to reveal the group interests. Based on this model, we developed a recommendation system that reflects user as well as group interests in a dynamic manner that accounts for time, allowing it to perform in a manner superior to that of static recommendation systems in terms of precision rate.},

Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis.

Instead of the low-level visual appearance, we design a CCA-PairLDA feature representation method to capture the similarity between images with high-level semantics. First, we extract the PairLDA topics to represent an image as a mixture of latent semantic topics in an image pair context. Second, we generate a CCA-correlation model to represent the semantic association between an image pair for similarity computation. While PairLDA adjusts the latent topics for all image pairs, CCA-correlation helps to associate an individual image pair. In this way, the semantic descriptions of an image pair are closely correlated, and naturally correspond to similarity computation between images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets for image retrieval and showed improved performance.},

The implications are that we need to focus the design of learning technologies to support social learning in context. Instead of designing technologies that ldquoteachrdquo the learner, the new social learning technologies will perform three main roles: 1) support the learner in finding the right content (right for the context, for the particular learner, for the specific purpose of the learner, right pedagogically); 2) support learners to connect with the right people (again right for the context, learner, purpose, educational goal etc.), and 3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. In the pursuit of such environments, new areas of sciences become relevant as a source of methods and techniques: social psychology, economic/game theory, multi-agent systems. The paper illustrates how social learning technologies can be designed using some existing and emerging technologies: ontologies vs. social tagging, exploratory search, collaborative vs. self-managed social recommendations, trust and reputation mechanisms, mechanism design and social visualization.},

This approach involves secondary sharing of user data and potentially benefits the user in terms of improved personalization and better experience. However, concerns regarding privacy arise when sharing user data with unknown third parties. These concerns can be alleviated at two stages: i) ensuring selective control of the applications to share user data with, and ii) monitoring and penalizing errant data consumers who violate the terms of their contractual agreement and potentially abuse user data. This paper addresses the second stage of data use contract enforcement. We propose a trust management mechanism for monitoring data consumers' compliance to the contractual agreements for which data was shared with them. The trust mechanism is based on user complaints about suspected privacy violations and is able to identify the data consumers who are responsible. The framework penalizes the data consumer found guilty of violating its data use agreement by decreasing its trust value. This makes the data consumer less likely to be selected to receive user data, and limits its participation in the user data marketplace, forcing it to pay a higher price for purchase of user data.},

Now it is time to rethink the system, which has grown in an ad-hoc, unstructured way, aiming at the support that will be needed for the next 10 years. In a project jointly funded by Microsoft Research and FAPESP, we aim at the creation of a specification for the new SinBiota 2.0 system, including cutting-edge services and technologies on information technology, in order to achieve a number of goals, namely: guarantee the use and expansion of the system for the next ten years, support the availability of a larger volume of higher quality environmental data, oriented also to the educational and public administration sectors, provide more efficient sharing of data among BIOTA researchers, inter-operate with international initiatives, provide effective tools to assist researchers in finding relevant information amongst a large amount of environment data. The expected results at the end of this project are the composition of a specification (Reference Document) of the SinBiota 2.0 system, and the implementation of a prototype that will gradually replace the current system. We propose in this work the system architecture and our vision of the main features that would allow SinBiota 2.0 to meet the expectations of the biodiversity research community and other stakeholders.

First, a semantic computing technique devised for mood-related tags in large datasets is applied to Last.fm and I Like Music (ILM) corpora separately (250,000 tracks each). The resulting semantic estimates are then correlated with listener ratings of arousal, valence and tension. High correlations (Spearman's rho) are found between the track positions in the dimensional mood spaces and listener ratings using both data sources (0.60 <; rs <; 0.70). In addition, the use of curated editorial data provides a statistically significant improvement compared to crowd-sourced data for predicting moods perceived in music.},

Edu-GAL will take advantage of a set of existing Web services that provide main e-learning functionalities. The project is located in the context of so-called Personal Learning Environments (PLE). Compared to traditional e-learning systems, in especially Learning Management Systems (LMS), PLE are more learner-centered as it is the user who defines and decides the environment at which he/she will learn.},

  abstract  = {An important challenge in Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) is architectural knowledge vaporization, i.e., the loss of technical knowledge due to a lack of documentation. In a previous work we identified that technical knowledge is usually available in unstructured textual electronic means (e.g. chat, mail, blogs, etc. - also known as UTEMs) used by AGSD workers during development, although not necessarily easily accessible. Also, we proposed the concept of Knowledge Condensation as a means to recover knowledge from UTEMs, by introducing a structure to their contents along with means to retrieve knowledge. In this work we present our first step towards a Knowledge Condensation tool, through a prototype tagging mechanism to structure architectural knowledge during UTEM interactions. We evaluated the prototype and obtained the following results: (1) a high perception of usefulness and a high projected intention of use, and (2) the identification of 6 tagging behavior profiles from participants. These tagging behaviors can be grouped as (i) participants who tag as expected, (ii) participants who tag more than expected, and (ii) participants who tag less than expected. These results suggest that it is important to cope with "little or no tagging" and "excessive tagging" behaviors to implement knowledge condensation based on UTEM tagging. Furthermore, we identified that tagging could be a good option to structure UTEM interactions, and to retrieve architectural knowledge from UTEM logs. Future work includes improving the tagging mechanism prototype based on the participants' suggestions and overall evaluation results, and implementing a searcher prototype to further evaluate the concept of knowledge condensation based on tagging of UTEM interactions.},

ManiWordle allows people to manipulate typography, color, and composition not only for the layout as a whole, but also for the individual words, enabling them to have better control over the layout result. We first describe our design rationale along with the interaction techniques for tweaking the layout. We then present the results both from the preliminary usability study and from the comparative study between ManiWordle and Wordle. The results suggest that ManiWordle provides higher user satisfaction and an efficient method of creating the desired "art work," harnessing the power behind the ever-increasing popularity of Wordle.},

Specifically, we first estimate document similarity by combining words and tags and then adjust the document ranks with the assumption that similar documents should have similar retrieval scores. On similarity estimation, we present a new feature extraction method, called CRMF, from which document similarity can be derived. The CRMF can integrate the content and relation properties of multiple views and mine their correspondence. Besides, it does not require that all the documents to have tags. We tested the proposed approach on collections which are derived from Clue Web and contain Delicious tags. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tags on document re-ranking, where CRMF is significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods using tags.},

Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social book marking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social book marking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data.},

Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

It is a challenging task because information provided by users on an SNS platform could be false, conflicting, missing and deceptive. One way to gain an accurate profile of a user is to link up all their multiple accounts created on different social platforms, which is referred to as Account Linkage (AL). However, existing AL techniques suffer from the problem of information unreliability. Recent advances in location acquisition and wireless communication technologies give rise to new opportunities for AL. In this paper, we propose a framework that links up multiple accounts belonging to the same individual by comparing habit patterns extracted from user-generated location data. We built a topic model to capture users habit patterns in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Results of experiments carried out on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed framework.},

Innovative information and communication technology (ICT) is a driver for the effectiveness and efficiency of enterprise collaboration and the management of inter-organizational business processes. In this context, cooperating enterprises need a shared understanding of their own processes, those of their partners as well as of emerging inter-organizational process structures. In order to create such a shared understanding, the concept of collaborative modeling can serve as a useful approach. This article introduces a concept for collaborative business process modeling and its implementation in the CoMoMod tool. The tool supports several aspects of collaborative process modeling, such as simultaneous work of spatially distributed modelers on one process model diagram. Furthermore the tool permits synchronously creating a collaborative model with different modeling languages by automatically mapping and converting the different model representations. The proof of concept utilizes Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and Petri Nets. The usage of an integrated chat messaging service supports communication during the process of collaboratively modeling business process.},

  abstract  = {Designing software for collaborative sensemaking environments begins with a set of very challenging requirements. At a high level, the software needs to be flexible enough to support multiple lines of inquiry, contradictory hypotheses, and collaborative tasking by multiple analysts. It should also include support for managing evolving human/machine workflows and analytic products at various levels of strictness and formality, processing partial and ambiguous evidence arriving in streams, and developing explanatory scenarios based on both serendipitous and structured discovery. Eventually, it should support the analytic team as they evaluate multiple alternatives and converge on one or more consensus responses, while preserving the history and underlying reasoning. Finally, it should be delightful and simple to use, not require an inordinate degree of precision and exactness, and be quickly and inexpensively deployable in a variety of rapid-response analytic situations. It has not been possible thus far to create a single software architecture that adequately balances all these goals. However, we can shed useful light on this problem by looking at the experience of semantic wiki architectures: an emerging class of software that blends wikis, databases, social tagging systems, and Semantic Web representations.},

Lots of studies have been conducted on content recommendation using users' common interests. However, little has been done to help users to select friends and share content within their social networks. In this paper, we contribute a recommendation framework AOPUT to recommend both content and friend list for sharing to users leveraging content and social information in SNSs. It consists of two recommendation components: Recder and ShareAider. Recder generates content recommendations by connecting users with common interests. An improved Jaccard similarity is proposed to improve the Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation quality. ShareAider recommends a friend list to users when they want to share content with their friends. CF method and a social-based method are compared and the combination of them are explored to achieve better results. AOPUT is evaluated on a real world social network. The experimental results show that (1) Recder can provide better recommendation quality than the traditional CF method thanks to the improved Jaccard similarity; (2) social-based method performs better than CF since the sharing behavior in SNSs are highly dominated by users' social preferences, and the combination of these two methods performs better than each of them individually.},

  abstract  = {With the expansion of e-commerce, recommender systems are drawing more and more attentions. Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular algorithm used for recommendation, but it performs not very well for sparse data and new users. The emergence of trust-based recommender system has solved the problem of CF in a better way. A system of this kind is commonly constructed based upon social network with trust relations. It contains not only user-item rating relations, but also friendships between users, and the friendships are very meaningful in recommendation. However, the trust values in the networks are all specified by users, which are subjective processes. In this paper, we propose a Top-K recommender system on social tagging network, and design a user-item rating matrix construction method on user browsed or searched information. We use tags, which can be regarded as users and items feature information, to compute the similarity between users or items. Moreover, we propose a Top-K recommender system construction method on the network with trust values computed from users' interest similarity. In our experiments we use the Last fm dataset, and we employ the RMSE and hit-radios benchmarks to evaluate the quality and performance of prediction on single item and Top-K recommendation. We compare our approach with two traditional CF algorithms. The experimental results show that our system has good performance, and it solves the defects of CF and existing Trust-based recommender systems.},

The easy use of tags, along with the ability to publicly share tags and resources from others, has attracted many users to actively participate. However, more and more users are facing the problem of effectively organizing and browsing the increasing tags and resources in one’s personal tag space. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically group tags in one’s personal tag space into tag clusters thus helping the user organize the large tagged resources effectively. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model one’s personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We also propose a visual interface model for tag browsing by incorporating Tag Cloud and clustering technology, where tags in each cluster are organized as a tag-cloud. Experiments on del.icio.us show that the clustering results are very similar to bundles manually created by users. The presented algorithm not only groups the semantic-related tags into clusters, but also generates meaningful descriptions for each cluster automatically. In addition, the prototype system shows that the grouped Tag Cloud visualization interface improves the visual representation of a typical Tag Cloud layout.},

In order to compose a system that bases upon an already existing implementation of a flight simulator the complexity of the system has to be reduced in a first step.

In this paper, we propose a method of identifying users' interest similarity based on clustering Hot Vertices (HotV). A hot vertex in a social network is an account which has a large number of fans. The approach extracts users' common interests by mining and clustering the hot vertices that the two users are following simultaneously. Both the experiment and theoretical analysis have proved that the proposed approach makes a significant improvement on the precision of similarity measuring with a relatively low time and space complexity.},

Software engineers are becoming more nomadic in carrying out their work, working from the customer location, the headquarters of their own company, their home, or sometimes even from their holiday locations. Technological support is needed to overcome the negative impacts of distance that are introduced by this trend. The central theme in this paper for supporting dislocated software engineers lies in increasing their awareness level to a level similar to (or even exceeding) what they experience in a co-located setting. In this paper we present the context in which we are bootstrapping a custom fit environment to support a team of fully dislocated software engineers and the incremental process we use. By working in this fashion we are discovering the requirements to support fully distributed teams while at the same time providing our setting with working solutions to help them with their day to day challenges. Finally, this continuous practical use also provides us with empirical data to validate the increase in awareness levels of dislocated software engineers and helps us in pinpointing important open research challenges.},

To minimize these problems, this paper suggests a user-categorized tag that freely defines the category of the tag when the user inputs it.

Nevertheless, there are no well-defined ways to describe DaaSes and their associated data assets. On the one hand, existing DaaS providers simply use HTML documents to describe their service. This simple way of service description requires user to manually perform service lookup by reading the HTML documents to understand DaaSes as well as their provided data assets. On the other hand, existing service description techniques are not suitable for describing DaaSes because they consider only service information. The lack of well-structured/linked model to describe DaaSes hinders the automatic service lookup for DaaSes and the integration of DaaSes into data composition and analytic tools. In this paper, we propose DEMODS, a Description Model for DaaS, which introduces a general linked model to cover all basic information of a DaaS. Besides the basic DaaS description model, we also introduce an extended model that integrates existing work in describing quality of data, data and service contract, data dependency, and Quality of Service (QoS). We present a mechanism to incorporate DEMODS into both new and existing DaaSes. Finally, a prototype of DEMODS has been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

This paper introduces ARTEMIS - a scheme to enhance automatic selection of training images using an instance-weighted mixture modeling framework. An optimization algorithm is derived to learn instance-weights in addition to mixture parameter estimation, essentially adapting to the noise associated with each example. The mechanism of hypothetical local mapping is evoked so that data in diverse mathematical forms or modalities can be cohesively treated as the system maintains tractability in optimization. Finally, training examples are selected from top-ranked images of a likelihood-based image ranking. Experiments indicate that ARTEMIS exhibits higher resilience to noise than several baselines for large training data collection. The performance of ARTEMIS-trained image annotation system is comparable with usage of manually curated data sets.},

  abstract = {Modern online social platforms allow their members to be involved in a broad range of activities including getting friends, joining groups, posting, and commenting resources. In this paper, we investigate whether a correlation emerges across the different activities a user can take part in. For our analysis, we focused on aNobii, a social platform with a world-wide user base of book readers, who post their readings, give ratings, review books, and discuss them with friends and fellow readers. aNobii presents a heterogeneous structure: 1) part social network, with user-to-user interactions; 2) part interest network, with the management of book collections; and 3) part folksonomy, with books that are tagged by the users. We analyzed a complete snapshot of aNobii and we focused on three specific activities a user can perform, namely tagging behavior, tendency to join groups and aptitude to compile a wishlist of the books one is planning to read. For each user, we create a tag-based, a group-based, and a wishlist-based profile. Experimental analysis, which was carried out with information-theory tools like entropy and mutual information, suggests that tag-based and group-based profiles are in general more informative than wishlist-based ones. Furthermore, we discover that the degree of correlation between the three profiles associated with the same user tend to be small. Hence, user profiling cannot be reduced to considering just any one type of user activity (albeit important) but it is crucial to incorporate multiple dimensions to effectively describe users' preferences and behavior.},

In order to analyze such networks, we need to obtain many snapshots and apply same analytic methods to them. However, it is inefficient to extract communities from these whole newly generated networks with little differences every time, and then it is impossible to follow the network growths in the real time. We proposed an incremental community detection algorithm for high-volume graph streams. It is based on the top of a well-known batch-oriented algorithm named DEMON [1]. We also evaluated performance and precisions of our proposed incremental algorithm with real-world big networks with up to 410,236 vertices and 2,439,437 edges and computed in less than one second to detect communities in an incremental fashion - which achieves up to 107 times faster than the original algorithm without sacrificing accuracies.},

In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand. Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.},

Fortunately, along with the rise of social media, social network is producing a large and rich set of social data (such as labels, trust, etc.), which provides a new way to solve the problems of collaborative filtering, namely, we can make use of social data to enhance the recommendation accuracy. However, traditional recommendation algorithms may only consider either the influence of similarity relationships or trust relationships to the user model, but fail to take full advantage of the implications of social data. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm called STPMF based on neighborhood model and matrix factorization model, where complementary roles of similarity relationships and trust relationships to the user model by means of a weight w are considered simultaneously. Furthermore, we propagate similarity relationships and trust relationships one step or two steps to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems. We have conducted experiments on two real world data sets from Last.fm and Delicious. Compared with existing recommendation algorithms, our method can effectively alleviate the problems of collaborative filtering, and enhance the recommendation accuracy.},

Such manual annotation process may produce diverse, redundant, and inconsistent tags. Besides, many tags which are inconsistent with their annotated Web pages exist and deteriorate the feasibility of social tags. In this work we will develop an automatic scheme to discover the associations between Web pages and social tags and apply such associations on applications of social tag spam detection. We applied a text mining approach based on self-organizing maps to find the relationships between Web pages and social tags. The disadvantages of manual annotation will be remedied through such relationships. The discovered associations were then used to identify social tag spams. Preliminary experiments show that the quality and usability of social tags were improved through this method.},

Firstly, instead of being purely exploratory, the focus of our research has been on developing techniques for detecting technologies that are in the early growth phase, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of relevant publications. Secondly, to increase the reliability of the forecasting effort, we propose the use of automatically generated keyword taxonomies, allowing the growth potentials of subordinate technologies to be aggregated into the overall potential of larger technology categories. A proof-of-concept implementation of each component of the framework is presented, and is used to study the domain of renewable energy technologies.

Sometimes reading just a method header or a class name does not tell enough about its purpose and meaning, while reading the entire implementation takes too long. We study a solution which mitigates the two approaches, i.e., short and accurate textual descriptions that illustrate the software entities without having to read the details of the implementation. We create such descriptions using techniques from automatic text summarization. The paper presents a study that investigates the suitability of various such techniques for generating source code summaries.

In this paper we predict the popularity distribution of YouTube videos within a campus network. We explore two broad approaches in predicting the popularity of videos in the network: consensus approaches based on aggregate behavior in the network, and social approaches based on the information diffusion over an implicit network. We measure the performance of our approaches under a simple caching framework by picking the k most popular videos according to our predicted distribution and calculating the hit rate on the cache. We develop our approach by first incorporating video inter-arrival time (based on the power-law distribution governing the transmission time between two receivers of the same message in scale-free networks) to the baseline (LRFU), then combining with an information diffusion model over the inferred latent social graph that governs diffusion of videos in the network. We apply techniques from latent social network inference to learn the sharing probabilities between users in the network and apply a virus propagation model borrowed from mathematical epidemiology to estimate the number of times a video will be accessed in the future. Our approach gives rise to a 14% hit rate improvement over the baseline.},

In order to detect unsupervised communities in social tagging networks, this paper uses similarity cloud properties of cloud model to solve the different community analysis, classification, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities problems. Cloud model is used in this paper. By introducing similarity cloud properties of cloud model, cloud model can detect the unsupervised communities, describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively, and users' dynamic interests in unsupervised communities. For illustration, the proposed model is applied to Delicious dataset to detect unsupervised communities and one month is used as time slice to study the evolutions of the unsupervised communities. Empirical results show that the unsupervised community in social tagging in network, using Similarity cloud properties of cloud model can effectively detect different unsupervised communities, and describe the evolutions of unsupervised communities quantitatively. Similarity cloud properties based cloud model can effectively detect unsupervised community in social tagging network, and quantitatively describe the evolutions of the community and community user' dynamic interest.

The rapid increase number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In this paper, the semantic link network model is used for organizing multimedia resources. A whole model for generating the association relation between multimedia resources using semantic link network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association. The hierarchical semantic of multimedia resources is defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different in the proposed framework. The modules of semantic link network model are implemented to measure association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two evaluation methods, including clustering and retrieval, are performed, which shows the proposed method can measure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.},

Results from the classifiers in terms of precision, recall and F1 score were mixed, suggesting that that not all tags could be used by public users for resource discovery.

Indeed, most of the systems base the indexing process on few generic text information (e.g., course title and teacher's name) and this creates problems to students who are looking for very specific topics and hence want to browse video in details. Moreover, additional metadata could provide useful information to those users who access the educational materials by means of assistive technologies. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows students to take on-the-fly notes while watching a video lecture and uses these notes to enrich video lectures with metadata that will be helpful to the indexing and retrieval process. In particular, to allow detailed video browsing, our proposed SOcial Learning (SOLE) system defines a set of eight predefined tagnotes and segments the lecture into a sequence of video chapters. Students can use the textual notes to describe and to retrieve the video material, providing hints about its content to users with special needs. To evaluate our approach, we developed a prototype version of SOLE and we asked for volunteer evaluators. Results showed that users feel comfortable in taking notes while watching a video and liked to browse video lectures using notes. According to the results obtained in the evaluation, both students and video lecture providers might appreciate the proposed approach.},

Based on CHH, a pairwise visual-textual correlation hypergraph (VTCH) model is used for tag-based social image search. To overcome the large number of newly generated hybrid hyperedges, a bagging-based method is adopted to balance the accuracy and speed. Finally, adaptive hyperedges learning method is used to obtain the relevance score for social image search. The experiments conducted on MIR Flickr show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

The traditional service discovery approaches mainly face two challenges: 1) the single source of description documents limits the effectiveness of discovery due to the insufficiency of semantic information; 2) more factors should be considered with the generally increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called SMS, for effectively discovering the appropriate services by incorporating social media information. Specifically, we present different methods to measure four social factors (semantic similarity, popularity, activity, decay factor) collected from Twitter. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model is applied to mine semantic information of services from meta-data of Twitter Lists that contains them. In addition, we assume the target query-service matching function as a linear combination of multiple social factors and design a weight learning algorithm to learn an optimal combination of the measured social factors. Comprehensive experiments based on a real-world dataset crawled from Twitter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework SMS, through some compared approaches.},

In this paper, we propose a recruitment method which takes into account individual and social attributes of workers to find suitable workers. The method discovers indirect collaborations between workers to harness implicit teamwork knowledge in order to increase the quality of crowd sourcing tasks' outcome and in the same time prevent collusion attacks.

Most people agree that now the new challenge is to explore the potential of that immense information and service deposit already collected, ever-increasing, and easy-to-access to promote a socially-aware recommendation and to foster a more efficient delivery of mobile services. The article addresses the above issues, still unexplored in literature, by focusing on integration problems and describing a practical design experience derived from the development of a socio-technical aware support for the management of mobile services based on the widely diffused and interoperable IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) session control platform. Our proposal is organized along three main original technical guidelines: an innovative support to monitor and describe via social, physical, and computation information the sociotechnical context where services and user interact; a recommendation system to automate and facilitate dynamic selection of the mobile services most suitable from both final user and operator perspectives; and a new IMS-based management platform to ease the composition of existing IMS mobile services and the monitoring and control of their usage at runtime. We believe that we contribute with a first step to the understanding of how full awareness of socio and technical information allows improving overall Quality of Experience (QoE) for the final users.},

To enable content based video retrieval, high quality textual metadata have to be provided that describe the content. Keyword-based search in general is particularly applicable if the searcher really knows what she is looking for and how to find it, i.e. to know the appropriate keywords to obtain the desired results But in many cases either the objectives of the searcher are intrinsically fuzzy or she has no idea of the appropriate keywords. Complex search tasks often cannot be answered by retrieving a single document, but require subsequent searches that build on one another. Moreover, if the user tries to achieve an overview of actually available information about a certain topic, today's web search engines are flooding search results by millions. Thus, giving the user no chance to review but the first few resulting pages. Traditional keyword-based search does not consider the meaning (semantics) of the content of the underlying information and result ranking is mainly based on link popularity.},

Disc jockeys (DJs) mix EDM songs from similar sub-genres for live performances in concerts and festivals. Given a large database of electronic music, if a system can classify songs into their respective sub-genres, it can greatly help producers and DJs while making mixes. We describe an approach to classify four major sub-genres of EDM using artificial neural networks. We extracted several rhythmic and statistical features from a database of 400 songs, evenly distributed among the four sub-genres, and used these features to train a Back Propagation Network (BPN) and a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). In addition to classification, we also employed the RELIEFF feature selection algorithm to reduce the number of features and improve our results. Comparing the performances of the two networks on the basis of their correct classifications, we observed that BPN combined with the features proposed yielded a better result of 94.16%.},

Although a number of techniques have been proposed for AL, their performance may be degraded by factors such as information asymmetry, poor data quality, data unavailability, as well as application scope limitation. In this paper, we solve AL in an unsupervised manner by utilizing user-generated geo-location data in SMPs, which is more robust than common clues used in existing techniques. A co-clustering-based AL framework is proposed in which account clusterings in temporal and spatial dimensions are carried out synchronously and enhance the results of each other. Experiments carried out on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed framework.},

Full-text keywords retrieval process (FKRP) is generally used to obtain the keywords of posts, and the keywords were then used to cluster posts. Another approach is to use tags or categories chosen by bloggers for their posts. However, the overhead of FKRP is relatively high and the use of tagging is associated with synonymy related issues. More recently, there is an emerging concept called social tagging, which is about having web resources tagged by the general public together. Similar to this concept, we developed a blog connect platform that collects queried keywords used by the people for searching for a post. With the queried keywords, formal concept analysis (FCA) associated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is used to cluster posts. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is better than those of other studies.},

Unfortunately, irrelevant information and noise are frequently included in such tags, especially when we use social tagging systems. Imperfect as they may be, social tags are still a significant source of human-generated contextual knowledge. We present the Waking And Sleeping (WAS) algorithm to overcome the obstacle of noisy tags. WAS refines social tags of each image and assigns each tag into either the waking state or the sleeping state. With WAS, the recommendation system not only enhances the accuracy of the recommendation results based on tags with higher quality but also reduces the consumption of computational resources.

Fas Tag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of Fas Tag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, Fas Tag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags. The experiments we did on several datasets show a significant improvement of the accuracy of the recommendations.},

There is a large number of supportive resources for SE that one can find on the web, however, information overload ends up saturating the students who wish to find resources more accurate depending on their needs. This is why we propose a crowdsourcing recommender engine as part of an educational software platform. This engine based its recommendations on content from StackExchange posts using the project's profile in which a student is currently working. To generate the project's profile, our engine takes advantage of the information stored by students in the aforementioned platform. Content-based algorithms based on Okapi BM25 and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used to provide suitable recommendations. The evaluation of the engine was held with students from the capstone course in SE of the University Catholic of Chile. Results show that Cosine similarity over traditional bag-of-words TF-IDF content vectors yield interesting results, but they are outperformed by the integration of BM25 with LDA.},

There are hundreds of OSNs, each with its own focus and offers for particular services and functionalities. To take advantage of the full range of services and functionalities that OSNs offer, users often create several accounts on various OSNs using the same or different personal information. Retrieving all available data about an individual from several OSNs and merging it into one profile can be useful for many purposes. In this paper, we present a method for solving the Entity Resolution (ER), problem for matching user profiles across multiple OSNs. Our algorithm is able to match two user profiles from two different OSNs based on machine learning techniques, which uses features extracted from each one of the user profiles. Using supervised learning techniques and extracted features, we constructed different classifiers, which were then trained and used to rank the probability that two user profiles from two different OSNs belong to the same individual. These classifiers utilized 27 features of mainly three types: name based features (i.e., the Soundex value of two names), general user info based features (i.e., the cosine similarity between two user profiles), and social network topological based features (i.e., the number of mutual friends between two users' friends list). This experimental study uses real-life data collected from two popular OSNs, Facebook and Xing. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and its classification performance measured by AUC was 0.982 in identifying user profiles across two OSNs.},

The idea is to adapt in near real time the content of a video stream to the viewer's profile. This concept encompasses any type of context-awareness customisation, expressed preferences and viewer profiling. To achieve this goal we propose a multi tier framework composed of a content production tier, a content distribution tier and a content consumption tier, representing producers, distributors and viewers, plus an artefact brokerage tier, implemented as an agent-based e-brokerage platform, to support the dynamic selection of the content to be inserted in the video stream of each viewer.},

  abstract = {Social tags serve as a textual source of simple but useful semantic metadata that reflect user preferences or describe web objects and have been widely used in many applications. However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e. non-IIDness), which means that existing text analysis methods such as LDA are not directly applicable. In this article, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation that models tag generation based on both users and objects and, thus, accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as a user-topic distribution matrix and an object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets showed that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely-used point-wise mutual information (PMI) metric. In addition, we analyze the learned topics and show that our model recovers more themes from social tags, while LDA may lead to vanishing topic problems. We also demonstrate our model's advantages in social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristics of the social tagging process.},

Traditional visual search methods use combinations of the confidence scores of individual concept detectors to tackle such queries. In this paper we introduce the notion of bi-concepts, a new concept-based retrieval method that is directly learned from social-tagged images. As the number of potential bi-concepts is gigantic, manually collecting training examples is infeasible. Instead, we propose a multimedia framework to collect de-noised positive as well as informative negative training examples from the social web, to learn bi-concept detectors from these examples, and to apply them in a search engine for retrieving bi-concepts in unlabeled images. We study the behavior of our bi-concept search engine using 1.2 M social-tagged images as a data source. Our experiments indicate that harvesting examples for bi-concepts differs from traditional single-concept methods, yet the examples can be collected with high accuracy using a multi-modal approach. We find that directly learning bi-concepts is better than oracle linear fusion of single-concept detectors, with a relative improvement of 100%. This study reveals the potential of learning high-order semantics from social images, for free, suggesting promising new lines of research.},

People could retrieve, organize, and comprehend Web pages thorough such tags. However, spam tags were significantly increased and deteriorated the effectiveness of social tagging. Tags unrelated to the content of the annotated Web pages were added intentionally to improperly manipulate the ranking or retrieval result for malicious purposes. Therefore approaches for filtering and identifying spams in various granularity were proposed to conquer such deficiency. Traditional approaches most focused on user-level detection which tries to differentiate spammers from normal annotators. Such approaches may suffer from the fact that misclassification of spammers as well as spam tags often happens since the intention and behavior of spammers change dynamically. It will be better if we can detect spams in much precise ways such as individual posts or tags. In this work we propose a scheme to identify individual tag spams according to the semantic relatedness between a tag and its annotated page. We first cluster Web pages and tags separately to reveal the relationships among pages and tags, respectively. A relationship discovery process was then applied to find the relationships between a page cluster and a tag cluster. We also devised a measurement to measure the semantic relatedness between individual tag and page. Individual spam tags were then identified according to such relatedness. We conducted experiments on ECML/PKDD RSDC 2008 dataset and obtained promising result.},

Term Frequency and Proportional Document Frequency (TF*PDF) is employed as a means to detect hot topics from patents, and IPCs are used to calculate semantic importance of terms based on the IPCs where terms are distributed. Aging Theory is also used to calculate the variation of trends over time. Four types of trends including very stable trends, stable trends, normal trends, and unstable trends are defined and evaluated based on TF*PDF and TF*PDF combined with Aging Theory. Experiment results show that for very stable trends, the combination of TF*PDF and Aging Theory achieves 0.976% in Precision; for stable trends and all trends, TF*PDF achieves 0.959% and 0.84% in Precision, respectively. By applying TF*PDF in consideration of semantic information, we also show a new criteria for weighting hot topics and technology trend tracking.},

  abstract  = {Three dimensional virtual worlds (3DVW) have experienced a large growth in number of users, and are being used for collaboration activities. In parallel, the research field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has developed taxonomies to classify systems that support collaboration. However, the CSCW perspective presents a bias towards traditional user interface paradigms, whose affordances are quite distinct from those of 3DVW, which include features such as the spatial environment, embodiment, and their dynamics. These are features which are regarded as significant factors in the research field of Presence, and yet, in our opinion, are not well appreciated from the perspective of CSCW analysis. Because of this, we question of the ability of CSCW taxonomies to properly describe the collaboration characteristics of 3DVW. By “properly”, we mean to say that 3DVW bring to fore collaboration characteristics that are in fact distinctive of them as collaboration tools, impacting collaboration in ways that are seldom found in usual groupware, and yet CSCW taxonomies do not distinguish them. We posit that these features should be contemplated in CSCW taxonomies and their usefulness taken into account in the development of future systems that aim to support collaboration.},

However, in order to find the desired information, the user has to go through a staggering amount of information retrieved from highly dynamic resources. Experimental results show that the approach proposed for constructing specialized domains improves the precision of information retrieval. Our approach involves enriching the user's query with related linguistic semantic and statistical semantic related concept terms. We employ natural language process (NLP) techniques such as WordNet engine to enrich the user's query with semantic lexical synonymous terms and a probabilistic topic model such as latent dirichet allocation (LDA) to extract highly ranked topic from a query's retrieved information. Furthermore, an intelligent learning algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) is integrated into the design to assist end users in selecting the concept domains that are most relevant to their needs.},

  abstract = {The blending of the emerging technology of social networking with unified communications has the potential to radically change how enterprise employees communicate. Enterprise social networking applications help employees build organizational collective wisdom and work more effectively by discovering implied relationships through shared social data. Unified communications applications provide suites of real time and non-real time communication enablers like click-to-call, click-to-IM, presence, and voice mail. Blending these two technologies permits text/audio/video conversations to be treated as social objects whose data and metadata can be stored, searched, tagged, and followed in social networking applications, just like other social objects such as people. In turn, exposing social data about conversations enables innovative new capabilities like recommending conversations for someone to participate in based on inferred interests, or finding and contacting an expert based on knowledge about conversations in the social network. This paper describes People & Projects, an experimental application used in Alcatel-Lucent to investigate advances in enterprise social networking. It also outlines early work on the integration of social networking and unified communications.},

The naive approach to perform filtering early at the publisher edge works only if complete knowledge of the subscriptions is available, which is not compatible with the well-established covering optimization in scalable content-based publish/subscribe systems. We propose an efficient rank-cover technique to reconcile top-k subscription filtering with covering. We extend the covering model to support top-k and describe a novel algorithm for forwarding subscriptions to publishers while maintaining correctness. Finally, we compare our solutions to a baseline covering system. In a typical setting, our optimized solution is scalable and provides over 81% of the covering benefit.},

For instance, to incentivize contributions, file-sharing systems based on the BitTorrent protocol equate value with volume of contributed content and use a prioritization mechanism to reward users who contribute more. This approach and similar techniques used in resource-sharing systems rely on the fact that the physical resources shared among users are easily quantifiable. In contrast, information-sharing systems, like social tagging systems, lack the notion of a physical resource unit (e.g., content size, bandwidth) that facilitates the task of evaluating user contributions. For this reason, the issue of estimating the value of user contributions in information sharing systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces this problem and takes the first steps towards a solution. More precisely, it presents a framework to design algorithms that estimate the value of user contributions in tagging systems, proposes three complementary success criteria for potential solutions, and outlines the methodological evaluation challenges.},

The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.},

Complementarily, there are aspects of semantic content authoring in which automatic techniques have proven to perform reliably, and the added value of human (and collective) intelligence is often a question of cost and timing. The challenge that this book attempts to tackle is how these two approaches (machine- and human-driven computation) could be combined in order to improve the cost-performance ratio of creating, managing, and meaningfully using semantic content. To do so, we need to first understand how theories and practices from social sciences and economics about user behavior and incentives could be applied to semantic content authoring. We will introduce a methodology to help software designers to embed incentives-minded functiona ities into semantic applications, as well as best practices and guidelines. We will present several examples of such applications, addressing tasks such as ontology management, media annotation, and information extraction, which have been built with these considerations in mind. These examples illustrate key design issues of incentivized Semantic Web applications that might have a significant effect on the success and sustainable development of the applications: the suitability of the task and knowledge domain to the intended audience, and the mechanisms set up to ensure high-quality contributions, and extensive user involvement.

  abstract = {Recently, in online social networks (OSNs), the least cost influence (LCI) problem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at identifying a minimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide cascade of information propagation. Most of existing literature investigated the LCI problem only based on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs such that information could be spread across different networks simultaneously. Therefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to consider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances. In this article, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the influence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI problem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and lossy coupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all properties of original networks to achieve high-quality solutions, while the lossy coupling scheme offers an attractive alternative when the running time and memory consumption are of primary concern. Various experiments conducted on both real and synthesized datasets have validated the effectiveness of the coupling schemes, which also provide some interesting insights into the process of influence propagation in multiplex networks.},

With the explosive growth of online texts such as online reviews and user-generated content, the text is becoming more sparse and much bigger, which poses significant challenges on both effectiveness and efficiency issues of text clustering. In our prior work, we presented a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm, which can avoid the zero-feature dilemma of highly sparse texts. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based approximate approach for scaling SAIL algorithm to deal with the large-scale of texts. Particularly, an instance-level random sampling is invoked to reduce the number of instances to be examined during each iteration, which substantially speeds up the clustering on big text data. Furthermore, we prove that the margin of errors introduced by random sampling can be controlled in a small range. Extensive experiments on eight real-life text datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed sampling-based approximate clustering method. In particular, our method shows merits in both effectiveness and efficiency on clustering performance.},

  abstract  = {With the rapid proliferation of information technology, researchers have access to large archives of scientific articles. This makes it more challenging to find articles of interest for researchers. Consequently, a solution to this problem, scientific article recommendation, has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel article recommendation method called Citation-based scientific Article Recommendation (CAR). CAR combines the information of researchers' historical preferences and citation relations between articles. We take into account the fact that, not all pairwise articles with citation relations are highly relevant although researchers generally find articles of interest by searching citations. Therefore, in our proposed method, weak citation relations are first filtered out through an association mining technique using data on researchers' historical preferences. Then, these filtered citation relations are incorporated into a graph-based article ranking method for enhancing recommendation quality. Through a relevant real-world dataset, we evaluate our proposed method. Our experimental results verify that the proposed method significantly outperforms other existing baseline methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

However, in spite of millions of man hours spent on manual annotation and recent advances in (semi-)automatic metadata generation, accessing these archives and retrieving relevant information from them remains a difficult task. Up to recently, the main paradigm to open up archives by automatic tools for audiovisual analysis has been a concept-based indexing and retrieval oriented approach. However, this approach has its limitations, in that it does not scale well, it requires strong supervision, and does not really match well to the user's needs. In this paper, we discuss some upcoming alternative approaches that try to overcome or circumvent some of these issues. This includes i) the use of knowledge modeling to bridge the semantic gap; ii) on-the-fly learning of new, user-defined concepts; and iii) weakly supervised methods that learn from associated text data. We also discuss what we consider important open issues at this time that deserve more attention from the research community.},

  abstract  = {With the development of Internet, the increasing volume of information posted on micro-blogging sites like Twitter necessitates the need for efficient information filtering. In conventional text classification problems, it is assumed that the feature vectors extracted from the available documents are sufficient to learn good classifiers. However, this conventional approach is not likely to work for Twitter due to the limited number of characters on each tweet. From a higher level, each tweet can be viewed as an abbreviated abstraction of a long document, and we only have a partial observation of this document. To solve the problem caused by the partial observations, we introduce a novel domain adaption/transfer learning approach called Assisted Learning for Partial Observation (ALPOS). The basic idea is to use a large number of multi-labeled examples (source domain) to improve the learning on the partial observations (target domain). In particular, we learn a hidden, higher-level abstraction space, which is meaningful for the multi-labeled examples in the source domain. This is done by simultaneously minimizing the document reconstruction error and the error in a classification model learned in the hidden space by using known labels from the source domain. The partial observations in the target space are then mapped to the same hidden space for recovery and classification. We compare the performance of this method with existing approaches on synthetic data and the well-known Reuters-21578 dataset. We also present experimental results on twitter classification.},

"Big Data" is on the covers of Science, Nature, the Economist, and Wired magazines, on the front pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. But despite the media hyperbole, as Christine Borgman points out in this examination of data and scholarly research, having the right data is usually better than having more data; little data can be just as valuable as big data. In many cases, there are no data -- because relevant data don't exist, cannot be found, or are not available. Moreover, data sharing is difficult, incentives to do so are minimal, and data practices vary widely across disciplines.

Borgman, an often-cited authority on scholarly communication, argues that data have no value or meaning in isolation; they exist within a knowledge infrastructure -- an ecology of people, practices, technologies, institutions, material objects, and relationships. After laying out the premises of her investigation -- six "provocations" mea t to inspire discussion about the uses of data in scholarship -- Borgman offers case studies of data practices in the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, and then considers the implications of her findings for scholarly practice and research policy. To manage and exploit data over the long term, Borgman argues, requires massive investment in knowledge infrastructures; at stake is the future of scholarship.

  abstract = {Tagging music signals with semantic labels such as genres, moods and instruments is important for content-based music retrieval and recommendation. While considerable effort has been made, automatic music annotation is still considered challenging due to the difficulty of extracting good audio features that capture the characteristics of different tags. To address this issue, we present in this letter two exemplar-based approaches that represent the content of a music clip by referring to a large set of unlabeled audio exemplars. The first approach represents a music clip by the set of audio exemplars that is highly correlated with the short-time feature vectors of the clip, whereas the second approach represents a music clip as sparse linear combinations of its short-time feature vectors over the audio exemplars. Music annotation is then performed by learning the relevance of the audio examples to different tags using labeled data. These two approaches effectively capitalize the availability of unlabeled data to explore the commonality of music signals to find out tag-specific acoustic patterns, without domain knowledge and feature design. Evaluation on the CAL10k music genre tagging dataset for tag-based music retrieval shows that, with thousands of unlabeled audio examples randomly drawn from the Million Song Dataset, the proposed approaches lead to remarkably higher precision rates than existing approaches.},

In this paper, we propose the methodology for detecting intent of Web queries using Community Question-Answer (CQA)information. Our assumption is that questions and its answers in CQA corpus reflect intents of questioners. To detect these intents, we use the semantic connections between questions and its answers. We categorize questions to find the connections of features within a question and its answers, detect intent words in answers by calculating supports of concerned CQA contents, and cluster questions and their answers by these intent words. Experimental results show that the variety of Web query intents can be found with satisfactory performance.},

Themes that emerged include documents usage, document attributes, social ties, opinion expression and organizing strategies. Results showed that the tags assigned by the subjects were influenced by all the factors. The influence from documents usage, document attributes and organizing strategies tended to play a more dominant role than social ties and opinion expression.

The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy. While the personalization algorithmis successful in both cases.},

The results of this study are expected to provide information that could help collaborative web search tool designers to find ways to improve the query suggestions feature for group users. Additionally, this study will test the hypothesis that - having domain experts working with non-experts using collaborative search systems would immensely increase the query success rates for non-expert users, and help them learn querying strategies over the course of time. If the above hypothesis is proven, then use of collaborative web search tools during training of interns would be highly recommended.},

Due to the diversities of users’ interests, different users may tag the same image with different tags. Therefore, tags not only reveal some important image semantic clues, but also show user’s preference, which can provide a new effective solution for overcoming the semantic gap as well as realizing a personalized recommendation. In this paper, a personalized social image recommendation method based on User-Image-Tag model is proposed. The main contributions of our work are that: (1) to efficiently make use of tags, social image tags are re-ranked according to the image content; (2) to obtain user preference, a User-Image-Tag model is constructed with tripartite graph according to the correlation among users, images and Topranking tags; (3) a personalized social recommendation system is implemented based on User-Image-Tag model. Experimental results proved our method can significantly improve the accuracy of personalized image recommendation.},

  abstract  = {Evaluation is important to assess the performance of a computer system in fulfilling a certain user need. In the context of recommendation, researchers usually evaluate the performance of a recommender system by holding out a random subset of observed ratings and calculating the accuracy of the system in reproducing such ratings. This evaluation strategy, however, does not consider the fact that in a real-world setting we are actually given the observed ratings of the past and have to predict for the future. There might be new songs, which create the cold-start problem, and the users' musical preference might change over time. Moreover, the user satisfaction of a recommender system may be related to factors other than accuracy. In light of these observations, we propose in this paper a novel evaluation framework that uses various time-based data splitting methods and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of recommender systems. Using millions of listening records collected from a commercial music streaming service, we compare the performance of collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) models with low-level audio features and semantic audio descriptors. Our evaluation shows that the CB model with semantic descriptors obtains a better trade-off among accuracy, novelty, diversity, freshness and popularity, and can nicely deal with the cold-start problems of new songs.},

  abstract  = {Cross-domain recommendation has attracted wide research interest which generally aims at improving the recommendation performance by alleviating the cold start problem in collaborative filtering based recommendation or generating a more comprehensive user profiles from multiple domains. In most previous cross-domain recommendation settings, explicit or implicit relationships can be easily established across different domains. However, many real applications belong to a more challenging setting: recommendation across heterogeneous domains without explicit relationships, where neither explicit user-item relations nor overlapping features exist between different domains. In this new setting, we need to (1) enrich the sparse data to characterize users or items and (2) bridge the gap caused by the heterogenous features in different domains. To overcome the first challenge, we proposed an optimized local tag propagation algorithm to generate descriptive tags for user profiling. For the second challenge, we proposed a semantic relatedness metric by mapping the heterogenous features onto their concept space derived from online encyclopedias. We conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets to justify the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract  = {In a recommender system, items can be rated across multiple fields by users with varying degrees of familiarity. Hence, the ratings in a recommender system should have different recommended weights. Ratings in fields where in the user has high or low familiarity should be given high or low recommended weights, respectively. However, current recommendation algorithms ignore this problem and use the ratings indiscriminately, thus affecting the accuracy of the recommendation system. In this paper, we provide a focused study of user-familiarity degree-aware recommendation and develop a user-familiarity degree-aware latent factor model for recommendations that considers both user familiarity and item features reflected by the tagging information. We also design a user-familiarity degree-aware probability matrix factorization model, which computes the degree of familiarity of a user with the items he/she has rated. By using the user-familiarity degree, different recommended weights are given to every rating to obtain precise recommendations. The experiment results on real-world datasets show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models and effectively improves the accuracy of the recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {The enormous success and diffusion that online social networks (OSNs) are encountering nowadays is vastly apparent. Users' social interactions now occur using online social media as communication channels; personal information and activities are easily exchanged both for recreational and business purposes in order to obtain social or economic advantages. In this scenario, OSNs are considered critical applications with respect to the security of users and their resources, for their characteristics alone: the large amount of personal information they manage, big economic upturn connected to their commercial use, strict interconnection among users and resources characterizing them, as well as user attitude to easily share private data and activities with strangers. In this book, we discuss three main research topics connected to security in online social networks: (i) trust management, because trust can be intended as a measure of the perception of security (in terms of risks/benefits) hat users in an OSN have with respect to other (unknown/little-known) parties; (ii) controlled information sharing, because in OSNs, where personal information is not only connected to user profiles, but spans across users' social activities and interactions, users must be provided with the possibility to directly control information flows; and (iii) identity management, because OSNs are subjected more and more to malicious attacks that, with respect to traditional ones, have the advantage of being more effective by leveraging the social network as a new medium for reaching victims. For each of these research topics, in this book we provide both theoretical concepts as well as an overview of the main solutions that commercial/non-commercial actors have proposed over the years. We also discuss some of the most promising research directions in these fields.},

  abstract = {Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, Web links, products, etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) method and the kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.},

Messages received by a user mainly depend on whom the user follows. Thus, recommending users with similar interests may improve the experience quality for information receiving. Since messages posted by microblogging users reflect their interests, and the keywords in the messages indicate their main focus to a large extent, we can discover users' preferences by analyzing the user-generated contents. Moreover, users' interests are not static, on the contrary, they change as time goes by. Based on such intuitions, in this paper, we propose a temporal-topic model to analyze users' possible behaviors and predict their potential friends in microblogging. The model learns users' latent preferences by extracting keywords on aggregated messages over a period of time via a topic model, and then the impact of time is considered to deal with interest drifts. The experimental results of friend recommendations on Sina Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging sites in China, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.},

The large-scale user-generated metadata not only facilitate users in sharing and organizing multimedia content, but provide useful information to improve media retrieval and management. Personalized search serves as one of such examples where the web search experience is improved by generating the returned list according to the modified user search intents. In this paper, we exploit the social annotations and propose a novel framework simultaneously considering the user and query relevance to learn to personalized image search. The basic premise is to embed the user preference and query-related search intent into user-specific topic spaces. Since the users' original annotation is too sparse for topic modeling, we need to enrich users' annotation pool before user-specific topic spaces construction. The proposed framework contains two components: (1) a ranking-based multicorrelation tensor factorization model is proposed to perform annotation prediction, which is considered as users' potential annotations for the images; (2) we introduce user-specific topic modeling to map the query relevance and user preference into the same user-specific topic space. For performance evaluation, two resources involved with users' social activities are employed. Experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Previous works on social networks were focused mainly on a single network due to the lack of links from one network to the others. There are several ways to connect different social networks. One possible solution is to find out the same individual who owns accounts for different social networks simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on the problem of linking the same users across different social networks. We start from a basic solution based on profile comparison, which is then improved by considering additional social relationships, i.e., friends. Finally, we propose a two-phase clustering method to generate a social summary for each individual. The first phase is to select strongly-connected groups as seeds. The second phase is to assign non-seeds to the clusters based on the social structure and profiles. The final distributions over various clusters are regarded as the social summary. The experiments have been conducted on two real social networking datasets. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed (social summary) method, compared to the methods of profile comparison and person-name comparison.},

However, fundamental knowledge about seniors in the workplace is still lacking, in particular the types of workstyle preferred by this demographic and their opinions about an ICT-based workstyle are unknown. In addition, an effective method to estimate seniors' skills and knowledge in order to match them to appropriate jobs needs to be developed. In this study, we aim to clarify the work demands of seniors and then propose a method of analyzing their skills in order to match them to work profiles. First, a questionnaire survey was conducted with Japanese seniors. The results indicated that most of the participating seniors valued maintaining their health, achieving a feeling of accomplishment, getting to know one another, contributing to society, and personal growth, as strongly or moderately important to their work. The consciousness of an ICT-based work style was significantly higher in the participants who regarded personal growth and contribution to their colleagues as strongly important. Finally, we propose the concept of skill matching by means of similarity evaluations based on TF-IDF (term frequency - inverted document frequency) calculations in documents pertaining to worker information and work profiles. The results show that this method can be applicable to matching single senior workers with work profiles.},

Different from existing solutions which employ user profile or social network structure alone, in this paper, we proposed a novel joint solution named MapMe, which takes both user profile and social network structure feature into account, so that it can adapt more OSNs with more accurate results. MapMe first calculates user similarity via profile features with the Doc2vec method. Then, it evaluates user similarity by analyzing user’s ego network features. Finally, the profile features and ego network features were combined to measure the similarity of the users. Consequently, MapMe balances the two similarity factors to achieve goals in different platforms and scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted on the synthetic and real data sets, proving that MapMe outperforms the existing methods with 10% on average.},

  abstract  = {In a social context, the user is more and more an active contributor for producing social information. Then, he needs a tailored information reflecting his current needs and interests in every period of time. This aims to provide a better adaptation while accessing the information space by integrating users' interests dynamic. Indeed, users' interests may change and become “outdated” through time. So, an interest judged as relevant in a period of time may fluctuate in the next period of time. Moreover, analysing the classic user behaviour to deduce his current interests is a difficult task. In fact, his behaviour isn't always reflecting his real interests. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enriching the user profile in an evolutionary environment such as a social network. The enrichment takes into account: i) the social behaviour and more precisely the tagging behaviour (that reflects user's interests) and ii) the temporal information (that reflects the dynamic evolution of users' interests). Our approach focus on the concept of temperature that reflects the importance of a resource in each period of time. This concept is used to infer common interests of users tagging the same “important” resource. The originality of our approach relies on combining information tags, users and resources in a way that guarantees a better enrichment for the social user profile. Our approach has been tested and evaluated with the Delicious social database and shows interesting precision values.},

We model the behavior of agents using theories of group stability and reinforcement learning. We show that increasing the number of credible or trustworthy agents and agents with a neutral point of view decreases the time taken to reach consensus, whereas the duration is longest when agents with opposing views are in equal proportion. Our model can be used to study the behavior of members in online communities and to inform policies and guidelines for participation.},

Four annotation-based ranking methods were proposed. The result showed that using only annotation as an index of resources may not be appropriate. Since social annotations could be viewed as a high level concept of the content, combining them to the content of resource could add some more important concepts to the resources. The result also suggested that both static feature and similarity feature should be considered when using social annotations to re-rank search result.},

In this paper, our motive is to develop a recommender system that is based on user assigned tags and content present on web pages. Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation.},

Meanwhile, the proposed recommendation approach is applicable to other application domains where multidimensional data is available. We empirically compare the proposed model against some state-of-the-art collaborative filtering recommendation approaches on two real-world datasets: Bibsonomy and MovieLens.

In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing based search approach named CrowdAPS to effectively find the appropriate APIs. Specifically, CrowdAPS leverages Twitter lists, which is a tool used by individual users to organize accounts that interest them on semantics. List meta-data, including list name and description, is generated from collective intelligence and can be used by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model to acquire semantic similarity between APIs and queries. Furthermore, CrowdAPS exploits list number to infer the popularity of APIs. The final search result relies on the integration of semantic similarity and popularity. Comprehensive experiment based on real-world datasets crawled from ProgrammableWeb and Twitter demonstrates the effectiveness of CrowdAPS.},

Linking these accounts, which is called identity linkage, is a prerequisite of many interesting studies such as investigating activities of one developer in two or more communities. Many researches have been performed on social networks, but very few of them can be adapted to software communities, as information of users provided in these communities has a huge difference to that in social networks. We tackle with the problem by introducing TBIL, a novel tagging-based approach to identity linkage among software communities. The essential idea of this approach is to employ skills (measured by tags), usernames and concerned topics of developers as hints, and to use a decision tree-based algorithm and another heuristic greedy matching algorithm to link user identities. We measure the effectiveness of TBIL on two well-known software communities, i.e., StackOverflow and Github. The results show that our method is feasible and practical in linking developer identities. In particular, the F-Score of our method is 0.15 higher than previous identity linkage methods in software communities.},

Using ten instances of offshoring succession identified through interviews, we find that the best succession measure can accurately pinpoint the most likely mentors. We model the productivity ratio of more than 1000 developer pairs involved in the succession to test conjectures formulated using the organizational socialization theory and find the ratio to decrease for instances of offshoring and for mentors who have worked primarily on a single project or have transferred ownership for their non-primary project code, thus supporting a theory-based conjectures and providing practical suggestions on how to improve succession.},

EBSNs capture not only the online social relationship, but also the offline interactions from offline events. They contain rich heterogeneous information, including multiple types of entities, such as users, events, groups and tags, and their interaction relations. Three recommendation tasks, namely recommending groups to users, recommending tags to groups, and recommending events to users, have been explored in three separate studies. However, none of the proposed methods can handle all the three recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a general graph-based model, called HeteRS, to solve the three recommendation problems on EBSNs in one framework. Our method models the rich information with a heterogeneous graph and considers the recommendation problem as a query-dependent node proximity problem. To address the challenging issue of weighting the influences between different types of entities, we propose a learning scheme to set the influence weights between different types of entities. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all the three recommendation tasks, and the learned influence weights help understanding user behaviors.},

The link-structure method assumed a referential definition of expertise, in which experts were users who tagged resources that were frequently tagged by other experts; the semantic-structure method assumed a representational definition of expertise, in which experts were users who had better knowledge of a particular domain and were better at assigning distinctive tags associated with certain domain-specific resources. Simulations results showed that the two methods of expert identification, although based on different assumptions, were in general consistent but did show significant differences. As expected, the link-structure method was better at facilitating exploration of popular “hot” topics than the semantic-structure method. However, the semantic-structure method was better at guiding users to find less popular “cold” topics than the link-structure method. Resources tagged by domain experts could contain cold topics that were associated with high quality tags, but these resources were less likely highlighted by the link-structure method. We argue that to facilitate knowledge exploration in social tagging systems, it is important to keep a good balance between helping user to follow hot topics and to discover cold topics by including expertise rankings generated by both link and semantic structures.},

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems have emerged as a prominent solution to speed up CDS. In this kind of distributed system, a particular interesting challenge refers to mechanisms employed to match user's interests and published contents. The efficacy of CDS depends on the expertise of publishers to properly describe contents, which comprises an important task to guarantee good quality of experience (QoE) to users. Massive attacks may harm CDS if countermeasure mechanisms are not considered to fight content pollution. The main objective of the thesis is to devise a mechanism to provide users a good QoE and reduce the effect of malicious interference. To achieve that, three main steps guided the research work presented in the thesis and summarized in this paper: (i) we proposed a novel strategy that operates conservatively to avoid wide pollution dissemination, (ii) we extended our previous solution to cope with the subjectivity regarding content descriptions, and last, (iii) we proposed a generic model to investigate massive attacks (including content pollution) and conservative approaches.},

To solve the information overload problem, some researches on personalized paper recommendation have been conducted. However, the knowledge gap between a researcher's background knowledge and research target is seldom concerned. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-gap based literature recommendation method to support researchers to fulfill literature support. Firstly, domain knowledge is modeled with the concept map, based on which background knowledge and target knowledge are analyzed. Then, knowledge gap is defined both graphically and intuitively with the knowledge map. To bridge the knowledge gap, we design a graph-based method to explore some suitable knowledge paths, which can help a researcher to learn the requisite knowledge in accordance with cognition pattern. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Doing so, we are able to refine the partitioning of the social graph with semantic processing and to label the activity of detected communities. We tested and evaluated this algorithm on the social network built from Ph.D. theses funded by ADEME, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency.

Proper organization of this content requires manual metadata authoring, since automated or crowd sourcing approaches are inapplicable in case of personal content or content of a small social group (e.g. family). Recently, games with a purpose gained popularity in solving many human intelligence tasks, with main focus drawn onto resource metadata and semantics acquisition. Games with a purpose seem to have large potential for solving further problems, but they also face several design issues involving mainly the validation of human-created artifacts they provide. In this paper we analyze these issues and propose directions for overcoming them for the semantics acquisition domain. Furthermore, we propose a method for annotating and presenting personal multimedia content based on our previously developed game with a purpose, which also exploits the alternative artifact evaluation.},

  abstract = {Social tagging is becoming increasingly popular in music information retrieval (MIR). It allows users to tag music items like songs, albums, or artists. Social tags are valuable to MIR, because they comprise a multifaced source of information about genre, style, mood, users' opinion, or instrumentation. In this paper, we examine the problem of personalized music recommendation based on social tags. We propose the modeling of social tagging data with three-order tensors, which capture cubic (three-way) correlations between users-tags-music items. The discovery of latent structure in this model is performed with the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), which helps to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, i.e., adapted to the particular users' preferences. To address the sparsity that incurs in social tagging data and further improve the quality of recommendation, we propose to enhance the model with a tag-propagation scheme that uses similarity values computed between the music items based on audio features. As a result, the proposed model effectively combines both information about social tags and audio features. The performance of the proposed method is examined experimentally with real data from Last.fm. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to existing methods that suppress the cubic relationships that are inherent in social tagging data. Additionally, our results suggest that the combination of social tagging data with audio features is preferable than the sole use of the former.},

In literature we can find three different clustering validity techniques: external criteria, internal criteria and relative criteria. In this paper, we focus on external criteria and present an algorithm that allows the implementation of external measures to assess clustering quality when the structure of the data set is unknown. To obtain an automatic partition of a data set and to reflect how documents must be grouped according to human intuition we use internal information present in data like descriptions provide by the users as tags and the distance between documents. The results show an evident correlation between manual and automatic classes indicating it is acceptable to use an automatic partition. In addition to presenting an alternative to finding the structure of the data set using meta-data such as tags, we also wanted to test the impact of their integration in the k-means++ algorithm and verify how it influences the quality of the formed clusters, suggesting a model of integration based on the occurrence of tags in document content. The experimental results indicate a positive impact when external measures are calculated, although there was no apparent correlation between the weight assigned to the tags and the quality of the obtained clusters.},

However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion.

The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

However, there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve users' or groups of users' satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users' behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve users' experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a user's needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection.},

In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective.

The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},

The paper initially provides a snapshot of Australian book publishing in a global context, and then summarizes our findings on the current and potential future impact of digital technologies. The original research employed an interpretive research paradigm, using a mixed methodology design, including an online survey of book publishers and the conduct of 14 case studies. Since completion of the project, the pace of technology-related change in book publishing has been addressed in follow-up research, based on a global context. In reporting this new research, the paper discusses in detail the diverse range of technologies, their limitations and the risks and opportunities they offer to the book publishing industry. This includes insights into the business as well as technical issues confronting the industry.},

  abstract  = {World Wide Web provides a huge collection of learning resources. However, as traditional retrieval algorithms lack the use of semantics to retrieve relevant documents, voluminous information is retrieved most of which may be irrelevant to the posted query. Due to which the learning process of a learner is slowed down. Hence, a need is felt to develop a retrieval and ranking method that produces semantically relevant web resources with information need. For this reason, the paper proposes semantically relevant retrieval and ranking of web resources that uses top N resource links returned from a search engine as seed, domain ontologies to compute semantic relevance, and data from Social Bookmarking System (SBS) to retrieve additional semantically relevant resources. Finally all retrieved resources are ranked according to the query relevancy using Vector Space Model (VSM). The proposed approach presented in this paper is elucidated in three parts: (i) a method that expands a posted query using semantic relevance by using ontologies, (ii) an algorithm to retrieve semantically relevant web resources by simulating human cognition using SBS, and (iii) a new approach to compute social semantic ranking of retrieved web resources. Thus it utilizes collective advantages of Social Bookmark Tagging System and Semantic technologies. Improvement in results obtained by the proposed approach in contrast to the existing results retrieved by search engine is apparent from empirical evaluation.},

Next, data from a Folksonomy site is used to conduct our empirical study, comparing the clustering effects of the two algorithms by experiment.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task multi-feature metric learning method which models the information sharing mechanism among different learning tasks. We decompose the real world multi-class problems such as semantic categorization or automatic tagging into a set of tasks where each task corresponds to several classes with strong visual correlation. We conduct metric learning to learn a set of (hyper)category-specific metrics for all the tasks. By encouraging model sharing among tasks, more generalization power is acquired. Another advantage is the capability of simultaneous learning with semantic information and social tagging based on the multi-task learning framework, and thus they both benefit from the information provided by each other. Experiments demonstrate the advantages on applications including semantic categorization and automatic tagging compared with other popular metric learning approaches.},

In this paper we focus on predicates available on DBpedia, the most important Semantic Web source of data counting 470 million english triples. Although there is plenty of work in literature dealing with ranking entities or RDF query results, none of them seem to specifically address the problem of computing predicate rank. We address the problem by associating to each DBpedia property (also known as predicates or attributes of RDF triples) 8 original features specifically designed to provide sort-by-importance quantitative measures, automatically computable from an online SPARQL endpoint or a RDF dataset. By computing those features on a number of entity properties, we created a learning set and tested the performance of a number of well-known learning-to-rank algorithms. Our first experimental results show that the approach is effective and fast. Further, we provide an extensive survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for RDF ranking, to which we compare our approach.},

This data can be used to extract different kinds of relationships which can be grouped into layers and which are basic components of the multidimensional social network (MSN) proposed in the paper. The layers are created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, i.e., direct and object-based ones which, respectively, correspond to either social or semantic links between individuals. For better understanding of the complexity of the social network structure, layers and their profiles were identified and studied on two, spanned in time, snapshots of the `Flickr' population. Additionally, for each layer, a separate strength measure was proposed. The experiments on the `Flickr' photo sharing system revealed that the relationships between users result either from semantic links between objects they operate on or from social connections of these users. Moreover, the density of the social network increases in time. The second part of this paper is devoted to building a social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations between users in a multimedia sharing system. Its main goal is to generate personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users' needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer in the MSN. The conducted experiments confirmed the usefulness of the proposed model.},

With the passage of time social network services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal investigations including understanding and tracking of dark networks, i.e., illegal and covert networks. Criminal organizations are well-suited to be studied using social network analysis as they consist of networks of individuals that span countries and continents using false identities over different networks to remain anonymous. There is a need to recognize the criminals carrying different fake identities to correctly track their immoral activities. This research article is focusing on devising a method which can be used to identify group of people i.e. criminal, terrorist or friends on different Social networks by analyzing patterns and performing correlations across different social network systems. Data integration using cross correlation is used to merge entities to form single fused networks. This single fused network also estimate the intensity of relationship between individuals in general networks based on the number of networks they are connected. To best of our knowledge no such studies is done in the social network analysis, therefore this method is unique and offers innovations in making effective use of presence of people in different networks.},

Currently, many commercial recommender systems are developed for recommending frequently purchased products where a large amount of explicit ratings or purchase history data is available to predict user preferences. However, for products that are infrequently purchased by users, it is difficult to collect such data and, thus, user profiling becomes a major challenge for recommending these kinds of products. This paper proposes a recommendation approach for infrequently purchased products based on user opinions and navigation data. User opinion data, which is collected from product review data, is used to generate product profiles and user navigation data is used to generate user profiles, both of which are used for recommending products that best satisfy the users' needs. Experiments conducted on real e-commerce data show that the proposed approach, named, Adaptive Collaborative Filtering (ACF), which utilizes user and product profiles, outperforms the Query Expansion (QE) approach that only utilizes product profiles to recommend products. The ACF also performs better than the Basic Search (BS) approach, which is widely applied by the current e-commerce applications.},

Mashup developers might often struggle to locate the relevant and appropriate services to satisfy their dynamic and personalized requirements. This paper proposes the concept of iSocialMash, a framework that assists the rapid, on-demand and intuitive composition of service mashups, by leveraging social networks. There two key observations guiding the development of iSocialMash. On the one hand, social networks can capture both common interests and personal preferences of different users in the same or similar application contexts; they might use similar candidate services and glue them together in similar manner. On the other hand, social networks can identify potential value-added composition of mashups; different users might have complementary collaboration opportunities for newly emergent goals. iSocialMash exploits the successful experiences of social networks to provide users with useful composition recommendations (such as missing or potentially proper services as well as connections between them). Capturing such composition knowledge, the users are presented by a set of ranked recommendations from which they can choose for their personalized needs. In iSocialMash, the data model leverages the social tagging to enrich the semantics and simplify the presentation and extraction of composition knowledge. We model the composition knowledge into some mashup patterns to accommodate different social networks interactions, and generate on-the-fly recommendations according to user personal requirements. We also experimentally evaluate the efficiency of our approach and present the current status of the prototype.},

Thus, they can define new schemata and reconfigure existing ones in a collaborative fashion. In consequence, the repository must react to changes in schemata in a dynamic and responsive way. Since schemata enable operations like navigation and search, dynamic reconfigurability requires clever indexing strategies, resistant to changes in these schemata. For this purpose, we have used conventional inverted indexing approaches and have also devised a hierarchical clustering-based indexing model. By using Clavy, a system for managing learning object repositories in the field of the Humanities, we provide some experimental results that show how the hierarchical clustering-based model can outperform the more conventional inverted index-based solutions.},

However, a critical problem of such system is that new users and items are always added to the system with time. How to overcome the data sparseness for such new incoming entities become an important issue. In this paper, we try to reduce the data sparseness in the link prediction problem via involving heterogeneous information network as auxiliary information sources. We developed two models based on the Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) framework. We also provided a detailed empirical study on how effectively different information networks could help with two real world link prediction tasks. We will report some preliminary results of our current work and also point our several potential research issues.},

  abstract  = {Defending against spam in tagging system is a very challenging task. This paper presents ReSpam, a novel reputation based mechanism of defending against tag spam in tagging systems. In ReSpam, timing behaviors and voting methods are introduced to defend tag spam. Each user has a global reputation which can increase or decrease after some judgement given bythe tagging system. When the system finds that the time between logging and posting is too short or the time between opening a webpage and posting a tag is too short, the reputations of all the users who post a tag of that kind will decrease. For a uncertain tag, the system requests some users to help to judge the quality of that uncertain tag. If the feedback shows that lots of users regard that tag as spam, all the users who post a tag of that kind will find their reputations lower than before. Otherwise, those users' reputations will increase. The advantage of ReSpam is its simple rationale and less computing compared to pairwise reputation based mechanism such as SpamClean and DSpam. The system ranks search result by the average reputation of annotators of each result. Experimental results show ReSpam can effectively resist tag spam and work better than some existing tag search schemes.},

  abstract  = {Information management has become an important challenge, especially when most of their relevant and strategic documents are available on the Web only for human interpretation. Annotating documents rises as an interesting strategy to diminish the hard task of retrieving important documents from the Web. Annotations consist of associating metadata with text segments of a document, in order to facilitate its retrieval by search engines. Besides improving their performance, annotations enable an optimized indexation of documents. However, due to the huge amount of existing documents, the idea of generating document annotations is not a trivial task. This paper presents a proposal for automatically enriching documents with semantic annotations, where document terms are annotated according to a domain ontology. Currently there already exist some document annotation tools to automate this process. However, the main contribution of this work is focused on the ability of exploring the ontology inference capability and on the meta-annotation concept, which aim at providing users and automatic agents with a more powerful mechanism to retrieve information.},

Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques augments the capabilities of the platform without additional costs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition in MCS deployed over a fog computing platform which facilitates important operations like user recruitment and task completion. Proper data acquisition minimizes the monetary expenditure the platform sustains to recruit and compensate users and the energy they spend to sense and deliver data. We propose a new user recruitment policy called DSE (Distance, Sociability, Energy). The policy exploits three criteria: i) spatial distance between users and tasks, ii) user sociability, which is an estimate of the willingness of users to contribute to sensing tasks, and iii) remaining battery charge the devices. Performance evaluation is conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants with new metrics that assess the efficiency of the recruitment policy and the accuracy of task completion. Results reveal that the average number of recruited users improves by nearly 20% if compared to policies using only spatial distance as selection criterion.},

In this paper we explore how tagging with freely assigned keywords provides developers with a lightweight mechanism to further categorize and annotate development tasks. We investigate how tags that are frequently used over a long period of time reveal the need for additional predefined categories of keywords in task management tool support. Finally, we suggest future work to explore how integrated lightweight tool features in a development environment may improve software development practices.},

A fundamental problem is how to significantly improve the large-scale system's scalability to interconnect a large number of servers and meanwhile support various online services in cloud computing. One way is to deal with the challenge of potential mismatching between the network architecture and the data placement. To address this challenge, we present ANTELOPE, a scalable distributed data-centric scheme in cloud data centers, in which we systematically take into account both the property of network architecture and the optimization of data placement. The basic idea behind ANTELOPE is to leverage precomputation based data cube to support online cloud services. Since the construction of data cube suffers from the high costs of full materialization, we use a semantic-aware partial materialization solution to significantly reduce the operation and space overheads. Extensive experiments on real system implementations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

To effect MTML content-based music retrieval, we introduce a tag-based music aspect model that jointly models the auditory features and tag-based text features of a song. Two indexing methods and their corresponding matching methods, namely pseudo song-based matching and tag co-occurrence pattern-based matching, are incorporated into the pre-learned tag-based music aspect model. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system on the Major Miner dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of using MTML queries to retrieve music from an untagged music database.},

Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement.},

Many millions of citizens around the world own smartphones, which they use for both personal and business applications. The majority of smartphones are designed towards Location-based Services (LBS). Consequently these smartphones have on-board GPS devices with the ability of locating the user to an accuracy of a few meters. While at the begining of the growth in popularity of smartphones and LBS technologies most users simply consumed services: where is the nearest coffee shop or subway station? Today, citizens are generating spatial data and information at ever increasing volumes. Examples include: georeferenced photographic collections, location-based social networking such as FourSquare, and volunteered geographic information (VGI). VGI is an exciting movement whereby citizens collect spatial data and information about (their own or another) locality. This content is then shared in collaborative projects such as OpenStreetMap, Geonames, Google Maps Mashups, or WikiMapia. This paper explores the risks involved in using this user-generated spatial data and information with specific emphasis on OpenStreetMap. Most citizens are not specialists in geographic surveying or cartography. Our paper provides results of a large case-study of high edit geographical features. We show that user generated spatial data is a very dynamic but has many inconsistencies.},

The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues.

Three social factors, the influence and the activity of the target user, together with the coherence between users, are fused to improve the performance of proposed recommendation strategy.

In ISCF model, the similarity of items was considered in user-based collaborative filtering, which contributes to alleviate the problem of data sparsity and therefore calculate the similarity of user. Experimental results illustrate that our approach ISCF outperforms the average method and user-based CF. Compared with user-based CF, the average improvement in the percentage of ISCF at MAE and RMSE are 21.9% and 17.7%, respectively. In addition, our approach ISCF can predict more items than user-based CF, and the average improvement in the percentage of ISCF at prediction diversity is 33.86%.},

We also present a mobile community framework with mobile Web Services to enable professionals to collect, manage and retrieve cultural heritage information in wide user communities. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in a social network. In a social network, nodes and links represent participants and their friendships, respectively. We have designed and implemented a query propagation mechanism and its applications to realize a social network composed by cellular phone users. In these applications, users can retrieve information from their friends or their friends' friends by propagating the query in the network. To propagate a query in a wide range and improve the query success ratio, most users who receive the query must relay it to all their friends. However, this increases communication packets. In this paper, we propose a query routing method to decrease the number of communication packets by using user profiles.},

  abstract  = {The rise of social media technologies has created new ways to seek and share information for millions of users worldwide, but also has presented new challenges for libraries in meeting users where they are within social spaces. From social networking sites such as Facebook and Google+, and microblogging platforms such as Twitter and Tumblr to the image and video sites of YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, and to geotagging sites such as Foursquare, libraries have responded by establishing footholds within a variety of social media platforms and seeking new ways of engaging with online users in social spaces. Libraries are also responding to new social review sites such as Yelp and Tripadvisor, awareness sites including StumbleUpon, Pinterest, Goodreads, and Reddit, and social question-and-answer (Q&A) sites such as Yahoo! Answers—sites which engage social media users in functions similar to traditional library content curation, readers' advisory, information and referral, and re erence services. Establishing a social media presence extends the library's physical manifestation into virtual space and increases the library's visibility, reach, and impact. However, beyond simply establishing a social presence for the library, a greater challenge is building effective and engaging social media sites that successfully adapt a library's visibility, voice, and presence to the unique contexts, audiences, and cultures within diverse social media sites. This lecture examines the research and theory on social media and libraries, providing an overview of what is known and what is not yet known about libraries and social media. Chapter 1 focuses on the social media environments within which libraries are establishing a presence, including how social media sites differ from each other, yet work together within a social ecosphere. Chapter 2 examines how libraries are engaging with users across a variety of social media platforms and the extent to which libraries are invo ved in using these different social media platforms, as well as the activities of libraries in presenting a social "self," sharing information, and interacting with users via social media. Chapter 3 explores metrics and measures for assessing the impact of the library's activity in social media sites. The book concludes with Chapter 4 on evolving directions for libraries and social media, including potential implications of new and emerging technologies for libraries in social spaces.},

In tag recommendation phase, a user selects single meaning among various associated words, so that associated words which belong to the chosen cluster are automatically assigned to the contents.

Discovering user communities from social networks have become one of the major challenges which help its members to interact with relevant people who have similar interests. Community detection approaches fall into two categories: the first one considers user' networks while the other utilizes usergenerated content. In this paper, a multi-layer community detection model based on identifying topics of interest from user published content is presented. This model applies Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine for modeling user's posts within a social network which yields to identify their topics of interest, and finally construct communities. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-layer model is measured using KL divergence which measures similarity between users of the same community. Experiments on the real Twitter dataset show that the proposed deep model outperforms traditional community detection models that directly maps users into corresponding communities using several baseline techniques.},

By grouping data points within a neighborhood, the interval-radial algorithm is O(N^2) for both agglomerative and divisive approaches under an easy to satisfy weak condition. The algorithm can adaptively adjust radius during its execution. Furthermore, the algorithm provides flexibility to users for them to select initial radius and step size such that to produce customized output automatically.

Finding and refinding these notes is a form of navigation that is integral to software maintenance. Although there is some tool support in modern development environments for authoring and navigating these comments, we have observed that these annotations often fail to remind and are sometimes difficult to find by the programmer. To address these shortcomings, we have designed a new approach for software navigation called tags for software engineering activities (TagSEA). TagSEA combines the notion of waypointing (a mechanism for marking locations in spatial navigation) with social tagging to support programmers in defining semantically rich annotations to source code comments. The tool provides support for creating, editing, navigating, and managing these annotations. We present the results from two empirical studies, where we observed and then analyzed how professional programmers used source code annotations to support their development activities over 24 months. Our findings indicate that the addition of semantic information to annotations can improve their value. We also provide suggestions on how annotation tools in general may be improved.},

The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf ·idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.},

  abstract  = {Over the past years a large amount of digital science education resources became available for open access through web-based repositories. These resources have the potential to support technology-enhanced science education by enabling science teachers to improve their day-to-day science teaching. Nevertheless, it has been identified that science teachers could benefit from their participation in communities of best science teaching practices by sharing, not only digital educational resources, but also learning designs that represent their pedagogical practice. This hasled to efforts on moving beyond web-based repositories of digital educational resources towards the development of web-based repositories of learning designs. Within this framework, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of three (3) European initiatives, which aim to support and facilitate open access to Educational Resources and Learning Designs in the field of Science Education, namely, the Open Science Resources Repository, the COSMOS Repository and the PATHWAY Coordination and Support Action.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging systems allow collaborative users to annotate shared resources with tags. Since they rely on user contributed content, social tagging systems are vulnerable to spam annotations, which are generated by malicious users to mislead or confuse legitimate users. Thus, mechanisms for spam detection need to be developed to combat the flexible strategies of spammers for the success of social tagging systems. Since annotations are lack of relevant feature, the classical method of training classifier to detect spam is hard to implement. However, with their collaborative nature, knowledge on the tagging scheme do exists in the way numerous participants annotating resources with tags. In this paper, we propose a simple but remarkably effective approach for detecting tag spam in social tagging systems with collaborative knowledge. We harness the wisdom of crowds to discover the knowledge on what should be high quality annotations for resources. This knowledge is then used to tell spam posts from the legitimate ones. A distinct feature of our approach is that, it can be easily extended for user level spam detection and can do well in both levels. The proposed approach is evaluated on data set collected from real-world system. Experimental results show a convincing performance of proposed approach.},

Then, we jointly learn multiple distance metrics with these extracted multiple features under which the probability of a pair of face image with a kinship relation having a smaller distance than that of the pair without a kinship relation is maximized, and the correlation of different features of the same face sample is maximized, simultaneously, so that complementary and discriminative information is exploited for verification. Experimental results on four face kinship data sets show the effectiveness of our proposed method over the existing single-metric and multimetric learning methods.},

But generally traditional methods assume every two items have same significance in database, which is unreasonable in many real applications. This paper addresses the issues of mining concise association rules with different significance, which can lead to reasonable but concise result. We find that weighted itemset search space is enumerable through exploiting the weighted support-significant framework. By adopting specific technique, duplicate search space can be pruned early with little cost. All the weighted closed itemsets are derived directly while enumerating them without many duplicate candidates generation. Then concise association rules based on weights can be generated. As illustrated in experiments, the proposed method leads to good results and achieves good performance.},

One practically important problem is: can the labeled data from other related sources help predict the target task, even if they have (a) different feature spaces (e.g., image vs. text data), (b) different data distributions, and (c) different output spaces? This paper proposes a solution and discusses the conditions where this is possible and highly likely to produce better results. It works by first using spectral embedding to unify the different feature spaces of the target and source data sets, even when they have completely different feature spaces. The principle is to cast into an optimization objective that preserves the original structure of the data, while at the same time, maximizes the similarity between the two. Second, a judicious sample selection strategy is applied to select only those related source examples. At last, a Bayesian-based approach is applied to model the relationship between different output spaces. The three steps can bridge related heterogeneous sources in order to learn the target task. Among the 12 experiment data sets, for example, the images with wavelet-transformed-based features are used to predict another set of images whose features are constructed from color-histogram space. By using these extracted examples from heterogeneous sources, the models can reduce the error rate by as much as ~50%, compared with the methods using only the examples from the target task.},

Many community detection algorithms are designed to process undirected graphs (i.e., graphs with bidirectional edges) but many graphs on the Web - e.g. microblogging Web sites, trust networks or the Web graph itself - are often directed. Few community detection algorithms deal with directed graphs but we lack their experimental comparison. In this paper we evaluated some community detection algorithms across accuracy and scalability. A first group of algorithms (Label Propagation and Infomap) are explicitly designed to manage directed graphs while a second group (e.g., WalkTrap) simply ignores edge directionality; finally, a third group of algorithms (e.g., Eigenvector) maps input graphs onto undirected ones and extracts communities from the symmetrized version of the input graph. We ran our tests on both artificial and real graphs and, on artificial graphs, WalkTrap achieved the highest accuracy, closely followed by other algorithms; Label Propagation has outstanding performance in scalability on both artificial and real graphs. The Infomap algorithm showcased the best trade-off between accuracy and computational performance and, therefore, it has to be considered as a promising tool for Web Data Analytics purposes.},

From the system's perspective, hashtags play an important role in tweet retrieval, event detection, topic tracking, and advertising, etc. Annotating tweets with the right hashtags can lead to a better user experience. However, two problems remain unsolved during an annotation: (1) Before the user decides to create a new hashtag, is there any way to help her/him find out whether some related hashtags have already been created and widely used? (2) Different users may have different preferences for categorizing tweets. However, few work has been done to study the personalization issue in hashtag recommendation. To address the above problems, we propose a statistical model for personalized hashtag recommendation in this paper. With millions of <;tweet, hashtag> pairs being published everyday, we are able to learn the complex mappings from tweets to hashtags with the wisdom of the crowd. Two questions are answered in the model: (1) Different from traditional item recommendation data, users and tweets in Twitter have rich auxiliary information like URLs, mentions, locations, social relations, etc. How can we incorporate these features for hashtag recommendation? (2) Different hashtags have different temporal characteristics. Hashtags related to breaking events in the physical world have strong rise-and-fall temporal pattern while some other hashtags remain stable in the system. How can we incorporate hashtag related features to serve for hashtag recommendation? With all the above factors considered, we show that our model successfully outperforms existing methods on real datasets crawled from Twitter.},

However, recommender systems on e-commerce sites are facing the problem of data sparsity. Data sparsity may cause poor recommendations, thereby reducing users' shopping satisfaction. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a new approach based on the idea that combines user-based collaborative filtering techniques with transfer learning. The method alleviates the data sparsity problem by transferring the knowledge learned from dense data set to sparse ones. We use the data from a glasses site as the dense data set and the data from an underware site as the sparse one, experiments are conducted for evaluating the proposed method in this paper. Results show that our method can alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the effect of user based collaborative filtering method.},

Tags are a new form of metadata increasingly used in social bookmarking sites by users to annotate bookmarked resources. Our goal is to harness the implicit knowledge contained in these tags to improve the quality of recommendations to users. We use both tag and resource-interest knowledge in our user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to profile users and compute similarity between them. Sparsity is a challenge which occurs in a Social Recommendation System when the number of tags and resources to profile a user are inadequate to provide good quality recommendations. To address this problem, we designed a Tripartite Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (TRNNA) which combines three views of the data: the tags (TNNA), the resources (RNNA) and the collection of tags for a resource (Resource Vector of Tags or RVTA). TRNNA computes distance between users based on Cosine Similarity, which in turn is used to provide a high quality recommendation of resources. Our empirical evaluation, based on a user study in which research papers were recommended to participants and relevance of recommendation was evaluated, indicates that TRNNA and RNNA provide better recommendation than TNNA and RVTA.},

To understand how research can contribute to improving the selection of components we interviewed developers from 16 Norwegian software companies which integrate Open Source Software (OSS) components into their systems. We find that the selection of OSS components has a situational nature where project specific properties significantly constrain the selection's outcome, and that developers employ a dasiafirst fitpsila rather than dasiabest fitpsila approach when selecting OSS components. This could explain the limited adoption of normative selection approaches and general evaluation schemas. Moreover, it motivates a shift from developing such methods and schemas towards understanding the situational nature of software selection.},

  abstract  = {Healthcare consumers in the United States are increasingly turning to the Internet for health information and advice. A majority of Internet users in the United States use the Web to find healthcare information for themselves or others. They are collaborating with other consumers in ways that were impossible before the advent of broadband connections, social media websites, and Web2.0 technologies. Some collaboration is explicit, like the posting of health topics on question answering sites like Yahoo! Answers, or joining a health maintenance discussion board. Other collaborative behaviors are less obvious and may be considered an implicit part of a healthcare consumer's Web activities. One such implicit collaboration is the use of the website Delicious.com to bookmark and tag Web-based healthcare information resources for organization and future retrieval. Tags assigned by an individual are visible to other users, resulting in a peer-created knowledge organization system of information resources. Tags can be created by the user solely for their own use, yet the community benefits from the aggregation of individual efforts. We explore the implicit collaboration through an examination of user contributed tags for consumer health resources on the social tagging website Delicious.com. This work investigates the characteristics of tags for healthcare resources on the web. Tags were collected using two methods. First, we gathered the top 100 published search terms for the consumer health website MedlinePlus, and used these terms to retrieve search results using the Yahoo! BOSS API. We then collected the most frequent Delicious.com tags for the first URL in each search. Second, human users were asked to perform fictional healthcare searches while evaluating a prototype search engine. Returned with search results were Delicious tags we collected and stored for use in guided search and other healthcare information retrieval systems. Evaluation of tags includes user intervi- - ews and comparisons to existing professional medical vocabularies and emerging resources like the Open Access Consumer Health Vocabulary [3]. In the Web2.0 model, peers have emerged as "guides" to health information, minimizing the role of established gatekeepers [4]. Finding credible, high-quality, and comprehensive health information is a continued challenge. Web users also struggle with health literacy and vocabulary gap between clinicians and laypersons. This work may lead to enhanced methods of developing consumer health vocabularies, Web search and browsing guides, and other tools for healthcare information seekers.},

The similarity between two documents is computed as a combination of their tag-base and, user-based cosine similarity and the document recency. We have con-ducted a series of experiments using a CiteULike dump to investigate the properties of the proposed similarity measure.

  abstract  = {The access to information is essential to learning as much as instruction. The evolution of the Web, from Web 1.0, where we were consumers of information, to a Web 2.0 where now we are producers and consumers of information, has allowed the Web becomes a huge database and in constant expansion. In these days much of the information published on the Web is published on social media, represented through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, to name only the most prominent. Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics, ranging from the length of text that can be used, the use of different forms to identify topics until reaching the reciprocity of relationship between the participants. For example Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called Tweets are exchanged, within the message can be used labels, called hashtags, to identify the subject of the message, the message also may include links to other resources that expand the original content or showing interesting information and the relationships between users are represented as non reciprocal relationships named "Following". The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this research through the use of linked data, that allow retrieving resources and link with other external sources, graphs databases that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis (SNA), technique to discover relevant information that goes beyond the individual properties. The scope of this paper is to use information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend Open Educational Resources in order to help with the learning process. The results obtained are a set of recommendations on users (identified as experts) and virtual communities (lists of Twitter users) and related events, according to the learning needs described as tags.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

In IR, when locating an interesting resource, a user can tag it in order to "memorize" it and retrieve it later. The user chooses the tags according to his/her needs or centers of interest. While previous work has addressed the problem of tag exploitation, to our knowledge, an important dimension is missing. None has focused on the tagging activity itself when considering the users point of view. An important open question is the following: will a user be able to remember tags he/she associated with a document in the past in order to retrieve a document again? Our paper tackles this problem. Considering a user study that implied 32 participants, we evaluate some elements (age, time...) that impacts the recognition and the recall of tags used in the past. This result is important specifically as it can be used in order to optimize personalized systems (e.g. user profiling, tag exploitation...).},

We show in this paper how a Hasse diagram is an efficient visualization strategy for eliciting different groups and navigating through them. However, we do not limit this strategy to these traditional uses. Instead we show how it can also be used for assisting in indexing new photos. Indexing consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a novel way of building the Hasse diagram. To validate the approach, we present some tests conducted with a sample of users that confirm the interest of this organization, visualization and indexation approach. Finally, we conclude by considering scalability, the possibility to extract social networks and automatically create personalised albums.},

Although tag co-occurrence has recently become a hot research topic, many studies mainly focus on how to produce the personalized recommendation leveraging the tag co-occurrence relationship and most of them are considered in a homogeneous network. So far, few studies pay attention to how to predict tag co-occurrence relationship across heterogeneous networks. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel two-step prediction approach. First, weight path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-occurrence relationships. Experiments are performed on real-world dataset, the Flickr network, with comprehensive measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that weight path-based heterogeneous topological features have substantial advantages over commonly used link prediction approaches in predicting co-occurrence relations in information networks.},

  abstract  = {Museums need to attract more visitors. Personalization of exhibitions is one way to achieve this end. Various options for personalization using information systems have been proposed. A major question is how directive personalization should be. Is visitor satisfaction highest if the system limits the burden of choice, or should it leave a great deal of autonomy to the visitor? This paper reports on two exploratory studies into methods for personalizing digital content presentation in museum exhibitions. The methods differ as to the degree of control they allow the user. Visitor preference for and acceptance of 1) profiling methods, varying as to context sensitivity and 2) presentation methods, varying as to the amount of guidance imposed on visitors by the presentation, were tested using a simulated exhibition. Test visitors varied as to age and museum experience. The main findings are that visitor satisfaction with context sensitive, stepwise profiling was higher than with immediate, abstract profiling; that independent exploration was preferred to directive presentation; that visitor variables had only minor influences throughout on satisfaction with both profiling and guidance methods. Implications of the studies for the implementation of personalized museum visitor support systems may be that using context-sensitive interaction resulting in suggestions to the visitor is a much more successful option than sign-in forms and the like opaque methods instantly returning a profile. In closing we recommend a continuous and adaptive form of profiling during the entire visit, enabling a flexible form of presentation varying as to the degree of guidance.},

A quasi-experimental research design was conducted in a medium elementary school in northern Taiwan. The results show there was a positive effect on information sorting ability and problem-solving ability. It also implies that students built an information organizing model by using classified Social Bookmarking of network knowledge to assist project-based inquiry learning.

A small but growing number of scientists and researchers are beginning to harness these Web 2.0 technologies as a transformative way of doing science. With the advent of service oriented architectures, the model of chaining services to create analysis workflows provides the research community unprecedented opportunity to collaborate, sharing their workflows with one another, reproducing and analyzing research results, and leveraging colleagues' expertise to expedite the process of scientific knowledge discovery. A crucial component needed for this unprecedented level of cooperation within the research community is a reusable, extensible and customizable environment for building collaborative Â¿open scienceÂ¿ portals for managing these shared analysis workflows.

Such personalisation is required in order to provide an adaptive Web to users, where content fits their preferences, background and current interests, making the Web more social and relevant. Current techniques analyse user activities on social media systems and collect structured or unstructured sets of entities representing users' interests. These sets of entities, or user profiles of interest, are often missing the semantics of the entities in terms of: (i) popularity and temporal dynamics of the interests on the Social Web and (ii) abstractness of the entities in the real world. State of the art techniques to compute these values are using specific knowledge bases or taxonomies and need to analyse the dynamics of the entities over a period of time. Hence, we propose a real-time, computationally inexpensive, domain independent model for concepts of interest composed of: popularity, temporal dynamics and specificity. We describe and evaluate a novel algorithm for computing specificity leveraging the semantics of Linked Data and evaluate the impact of our model on user profiles of interests.},

There is constant pressure to reduce costs and improve performance and quality. Success demands the ability to continuously learn and adapt. Standardization is recognized as essential to reducing variation and, therefore, costs, as well as managing quality. Public frameworks and standards, such as ITIL® (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), provide best-practice guidance and a common vocabulary for managing IT (information technology) services. In this paper, we explore the role that social networking and “crowdsourcing” can play in socializing and developing best practices for a service delivery organization. We draw on our experience developing and deploying a social networking application, called Cyano, which is being used by approximately 13,000 IT professionals to capture and maintain day-to-day activities, processes, and artifacts used for problem and change management of several hundred outsourced infrastructures. Cyano is a new breed of social networking enterprise applications, in which crowdsourcing is leveraged to enrich and maintain IT processes and social networks are not created by explicit membership, but rather are implicitly discovered by the type of activities and infrastructure elements that various users support. In this paper, we focus on 1) the architecture of Cyano for supporting social tagging and linkage across different layers of management applications, 2) process customization and governance, and 3) an automated recommendation system that has been well received by thousands of IT professionals. We also highlight research challenges in this space.},

Consumers who significantly influence the opinions and decisions of others through communicative acts are called opinion leaders. These leaders usually capture the most representative opinions and play a crucial role in electronic word-of-mouth. Since opinion leaders have different expertise and interests, they are typically topic sensitive. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of identifying topic-sensitive opinion leaders in online review communities, and present a two-stage approach. In Stage I, we derive opinion leaders' interest from their tags. In Stage II, we rank leaders according to not only the link structure of networks but also opinion leaders' personal expertise and interests. A preliminary experiment on real-world data indicates the proposed approach is effective.},

  abstract  = {As an alternative to traditional client-server systems, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems provide major advantages in terms of scalability, autonomy and dynamic behavior of peers, and decentralization of control. Thus, they are well suited for large-scale data sharing in distributed environments. Most of the existing P2P approaches for data sharing rely on either structured networks (e.g., DHTs) for efficient indexing, or unstructured networks for ease of deployment, or some combination. However, these approaches have some limitations, such as lack of freedom for data placement in DHTs, and high latency and high network traffic in unstructured networks. To address these limitations, gossip protocols which are easy to deploy and scale well, can be exploited. In this book, we will give an overview of these different P2P techniques and architectures, discuss their trade-offs, and illustrate their use for decentralizing several large-scale data sharing applications.

  abstract  = {The rapid growth of smart phones and recent advances in telephony have triggered an enormous increase in the number of telephony subscribers. Some people have more than one calling identity for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Discovering multiple identities of an individual can be important for fraud detection, detection of coordinated criminals, collaborative recommendations, and analyses of complete social graph of an individual. To address the challenge of finding identities that belong to a single individual, this paper describes ID-CONNECT, an approach for linking multiple identities of an individual based on that individual's social call graph and call behavior. The approach is based on the assumption that similarity between identities can be better estimated by using both call network and call behavior of identities towards their friends and that the more similar the weighted call graph of two identities, the higher is the similarity between them. ID-CONNECT is a two-step approach: 1) it estimates similarity between identities by incorporating call rate and duration, and 2) it generates sets of candidate identities for each target identity. We experimentally evaluate our approach on different random graph models and compare its performance against other approaches. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly reduces candidate set size (up to 70%) while achieving comparable true positive rate.},

In this paper, we investigate how to enhance Web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method called “Tripartite Clustering” which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information.},

The search space consists of named objects that are modeled as sets of attribute-value pairs. The data model is more general than the relational model, and the query language is more expressive than relational calculus. The paper shows that distributed query processing can be performed using an echo algorithm and that name resolution can be embedded in query processing. Finally, two use cases for network search are presented, one in networking and one in cloud computing, the latter backed up by a prototype implementation.},

  abstract  = {A social tagging system, such as del.icio.us and Flickr, allows users to annotate resources (e.g., web pages and photos) with text descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable information for searching, mining, and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result, while some highly-popular resources are over-tagged, most of the resources are under-tagged. Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-based techniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tag specific resources, how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcing environment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this question by observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been tagged a sufficient number of times. We formalize the concepts of tagging quality (TQ) and tagging stability (TS) in measuring the quality of a resource's tag description. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed “budget” (i.e., the amount of money paid for tagging resources). This solution decides the amount of rewards that should be invested on each resource in order to maximize tagging stability. We further propose a few simple, practical, and efficient incentive allocation strategies. On a dataset from del.icio.us, our best strategy provides resources with a close-to-optimal gain in tagging stability.},

  abstract = {Social tagging becomes increasingly important to organize and search large-scale community-contributed photos on social websites. To facilitate generating high-quality social tags, tag recommendation by automatically assigning relevant tags to photos draws particular research interest. In this paper, we focus on the personalized tag recommendation task and try to identify user-preferred, geo-location-specific as well as semantically relevant tags for a photo by leveraging rich contexts of the freely available community-contributed photos. For users and geo-locations, we assume they have different preferred tags assigned to a photo, and propose a subspace learning method to individually uncover the both types of preferences. The goal of our work is to learn a unified subspace shared by the visual and textual domains to make visual features and textual information of photos comparable. Considering the visual feature is a lower level representation on semantics than the textual information, we adopt a progressive learning strategy by additionally introducing an intermediate subspace for the visual domain, and expect it to have consistent local structure with the textual space. Accordingly, the unified subspace is mapped from the intermediate subspace and the textual space respectively. We formulate the above learning problems into a united form, and present an iterative optimization with its convergence proof. Given an untagged photo with its geo-location to a user, the user-preferred and the geo-location-specific tags are found by the nearest neighbor search in the corresponding unified spaces. Then we combine the obtained tags and the visual appearance of the photo to discover the semantically and visually related photos, among which the most frequent tags are used as the recommended tags. Experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Flickr verify the effectivity of the proposed solution.},

First, we present an approach for automatic retrieval of software components in reuse libraries. Second, the system implements a source-code recommendation approach which automatically constructs and delivers relevant code examples that demonstrate how the retrieved components can be used to solve particular programming problems. In arriving at such solutions, we utilize ontological modeling to provide semantic representation of the conceptual source-code knowledge in software libraries. This representation is the basis for computing entailments and enabling semantic reasoning. Our experiments show evidence that combining ontology formalisms with context-sensitive techniques enhance precision when retrieving and recommending reusable code even without mining a carefully crafted corpus of similar code.},

Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

Strong information protection can be a competitive advantage, but preserving privacy is a real challenge when people use the mobile apps in the smartphone. If they are too lax with privacy preserving, important or sensitive information could be lost. If they are too tight with privacy, making users jump through endless hoops to access the data they need to get their work done, productivity can nosedive. Thus, striking a balance between privacy and usability in mobile applications can be difficult. Leveraging the privacy permission settings in mobile operating systems, our basic idea to address this issue is to provide proper recommendations about the settings so that the users can preserve their sensitive information and maintain the usability of apps. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive recommendation system to implement this idea, which can crowdsource users’ privacy permission settings and generate the recommendations for them accordingly. Besides, our system allows users to provide feedback to revise the recommendations for getting better performance and adapting different scenarios. For the evaluation, we collected users’ preferences from 382 participants on Amazon Technical Turks and released our system to users in the real world for 10 days. According to the study, our system can make appropriate recommendations which can meet participants’ privacy expectation and mobile apps’ usability.},

We argue that code bookmarking can be effectively used to document a developer's findings, to retrieve this valuable knowledge later on, and to share the findings with other team members. We present a tool, called Pollicino, for collective code bookmarking. To gather requirements for our bookmarking tool, we conducted an online survey and interviewed professional software engineers about their current usage and needs of code bookmarks. We describe our approach and the tool we implemented. To assess the tool's effectiveness, adequacy, and usability, we present an exploratory pre-experimental user study we have performed with 11 participants.},

Although numerous efforts have been invested in to the personalisation of dynamic web content, the voluminous and diversified production of continuous online information still poses significant research challenges. In this paper, we propose a profiling mechanism that learns the user access patterns in a dynamic environment like RSS feeds. Main goal of the proposed mechanism is the retrieval optimisation and personalised recommendation of RSS feeds in close to real time. The mechanism allocates personalized time windows based on the learned access patterns and tries to minimize the chances of time-sensitive information from being missed by the user using a delay minimisation algorithm based on Non-homogenous Poisson Process. The mechanism acquires implicit feedback from the user interaction to calculate potential recommendations. The experiments conducted prove the significance of the mechanism in terms of optimised information retrieval and faster adaptation process where it clearly outperforms the other mechanisms in the literature on these properties.},

Motivated by the observation that media contents are usually shared frequently in online communities and thus have a lot of social diffusion records, we propose a novel media annotating approach depending on these social diffusion records instead of metadata. The basic assumption is that the social diffusion records reflect the common interests (CI) between users, which can be analyzed for generating annotations. With this assumption, we present a novel CI-based social diffusion model and translate the automatic annotating task into the CI-based diffusion maximization (CIDM) problem. Moreover, we propose to solve the CIDM problem through two optimization tasks, corresponding to the training and test stages in supervised learning. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach can effectively generate high quality annotations, and thus demonstrate the capability of social diffusion analysis in annotating media.},

In this work, we study the problem of predicting directed communication intention between two users. Link prediction is similar to communication intention in that it uses network structure for prediction. However, these two problems exhibit fundamental differences that originate from their focus. Link prediction uses evidence to predict network structure evolution, whereas our focal point is directed communication initiation between users who are previously not structurally connected. To address this problem, we employ topological evidence in conjunction to transactional information in order to predict communication intention. It is not intuitive whether methods that work well for link prediction would work well in this case. In fact, we show in this work that network or content evidence, when considered separately, are not sufficiently accurate predictors. Our novel approach, which jointly considers local structural properties of users in a social network, in conjunction with their generated content, captures numerous interactions, direct and indirect, social and contextual, which have up to date been considered independently. We performed an empirical study to evaluate our method using an extracted network of directed @-messages sent between users of a corporate micro logging service, which resembles Twitter. We find that our method outperforms state of the art techniques for link prediction. Our findings have implications for a wide range of social web applications, such as contextual expert recommendation for Q&A, new friendship relationships creation, and targeted content delivery.},

The algorithm utilizes social tagging to contribute in increasing the quality for searching for places, services, and the discovering communities of the same interest. By exploiting social tagging, we propose a model which analyzes comments and feedback of posts published by users online. We demonstrate how the proposed algorithm can better utilize social information to improve the discovering of relevant items for a given user.

  abstract  = {Recently, social tagging systems become more and more popular in many Web 2.0 applications. In such systems, Users are allowed to annotate a particular resource with a freely chosen a set of tags. These user-generated tags can represent users' interests more concise and closer to human understanding. Interests will change over time. Thus, how to describe users' interests and interests transfer path become a big challenge for personalized recommendation systems. In this approach, we propose a variable-length time interval division algorithm and user interest model based on time interval. Then, in order to draw users' interests transfer path over a specific time period, we suggest interest transfer model. After that, we apply a classical community partition algorithm in our approach to separate users into communities. Finally, we raise a novel method to measure users' similarities based on interest transfer model and provide personalized tag recommendation according to similar users' interests in their next time intervals. Experimental results demonstrate the higher precision and recall with our approach than classical user-based collaborative filtering methods.},

The objective of web document clustering is to meet the need of retrieving web document efficiently from massive information in Internet. Recently social tagging is the important form of document organization in web 2.0, and the tagging as a document descriptor is used to improve the effectiveness of web searching. But a web document usually belongs to various category of tagging, which may lead to the difficulty of browsing web document based on single tagging. This paper explores the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as mathematical tool to analyze the social tagging of web document, and presents a model for web document clustering based on tagging semantic. Furthermore, taking community web site Douban as an example, the model is applied to allow users to tag and serendipitously browse web document using Formal Concept Analysis.},

We compute a set of significant tag neighbor candidates based on the neighbor frequency and weight, and utilize the most frequent and weighted neighbors to expand an entry query that has terms matching tags. The proposed approach is evaluated using MedWorm medical article collection and standard evaluation methods from the text retrieval conference (TREC). We compared the baseline of 0.353 for Mean Average Precision (MAP), reaching a MAP 0.491 (+39%) with the query expansion. In-depth analysis shows how this strategy is beneficial when compared with different ranks of the retrieval results.},

We proposed approaches to infer user interest on Social media where often multi-modal data (text, image etc.) exists. We use user-generated data from Pinterest.com as a natural expression of users' interests. We consider each pin (image-text pair) as a category label that represents a broad user interest, since users collect images that they like on the social media platform and often assign a category label. This task is useful beyond Pinterest because most user-generated data on the Web is not necessarily readily categorized into interest labels. In addition to predicting users' interests, our main contribution is exploiting a multi-modal space composed of images and text. This is a natural approach since humans express their interests with a combination of modalities. Exploiting multi-modal spaces in this context has received little attention in the literature. We performed eleven experiments using the state-of-the-art image and textual representations, such as convolutional neural networks, word embeddings, and bags of visual and textual words. Our experimental results show that in fact jointly processing image and text increases the overall interest classification accuracy, when compared to uni-modal representations (i.e., using only text or using only images).},

However, many interactions among individuals can be modeled as Prisoner's Dilemma game, which suppresses the emergence of cooperation. In order to provide scalable and robust services in such systems, incentive mechanisms need to be introduced. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism called recommendation incentive mechanism based on evolutionary dynamics(RIMBED). In our RIMBED system, players who pay an additional cost for recommendation service not only can get the information of the opponents, but also can have a higher probability to interact with cooperative individuals. Using the replicator dynamics equations in evolutionary game theory, we mathematically analyze the robustness and effectiveness of our RIMBED system. Meanwhile, simulation experiments can also validate our mathematical analysis. In our RIMBED system, players have three alternative strategies: always cooperative(ALLC), always defective(ALLD) and rational cooperative(RC). No one strategy can dominate the others forever and all the three strategies can survive in our system. When we bring in population invasion and a small mutation, our system can still work at an excellent level.},

In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users.},

Historically the emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance scholars”. In today's world, most of the significant problems are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending "giftwrapping" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century. The conceptual framework is illustrated by specific developments of social-technical environments that we have designed and evaluated including: collaborative, domain-oriented design environments, environments created by mass collaboration, and courses-as-seeds.},

In joining this stream of research, we have developed and evaluated two enhancements of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on Cite ULike, a social tagging service for scientific articles. The result obtained after two phases of evaluation suggests that both enhancements are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms, as we do in our NwCF approach, leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 similarity measure, an alternative to Pearson correlation for calculating the similarity between users and their neighbors, increases the coverage of the recommendation process.},

However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

To this end, an image heterogeneous graph is first built to integrate various visual features, and then a simultaneous ranking and clustering algorithm is introduced to generate visually and semantically compact image clusters, named visualsets.

  abstract  = {As online information grows dramatically, search engines such as Google are playing a more and more important role in our lives. Critical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective retrieval model that can rank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research problem in information retrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval models, often referred to as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many different information retrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector space model, these new models have a more sound statistical foundation and can leverage statistical estimation to optimize retrieval parameters. They can also be more easily adapted to model non-traditional and complex retrieval problems. Empirically, they tend to achieve comparable or better performance than a traditional model with less effort on parameter tuning. This book systemati ally reviews the large body of literature on applying statistical language models to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles, empirically effective language models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. All the relevant literature has been synthesized to make it easy for a reader to digest the research progress achieved so far and see the frontier of research in this area. The book also offers practitioners an informative introduction to a set of practically useful language models that can effectively solve a variety of retrieval problems. No prior knowledge about information retrieval is required, but some basic knowledge about probability and statistics would be useful for fully digesting all the details.

  abstract  = {In recent years, huge amount of digital documents have been created in online social communities. Locating and recommending relevant documents to users in need is not a trivial task. In this paper, we introduce an approach to computing document similarity for building document recommender systems. This approach takes into account document internal content, together with social tags and associated users. These three factors are considered as three dimensions of a document in social space. The similarity computation is performed independently in each dimension, and then aggregated according to user preferences. This allows users to customize their views over the document. Experiments have been conducted with the proposed approach using data crawled from Cite Like. Experimental result has confirmed that all three dimensions have important contributions to document similarity computation.},

The number of lecture video data on the web is growing quickly. Therefore, an additional skillful method for video retrieval within huge lecture video archives is immediately desired. This paper comes close to regular video indexing and video stalk in large lecture videos collection. We apply Automatic video segmentation and key-frame detection to present an image instruction for the video content navigation. In this process, video will be retrieved based on content based video search for the input of speech and video text content. Histogram of gradient and Support Vector Machine is used for the feature extraction from the video and to get the accurate result respectively. This will collect required features from lecture video database as labeled with speech recognition and also retrieve lecture video from database as better than existing algorithm. Hence the proposed system will be more efficient for retrieving the videos and also improves the recognition rate.},

  abstract  = {Network search makes operational data available in real-time to management applications. In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.},

We are developing the LearnWeb2.0 platform through an iterative evaluation-driven design-based research approach - this paper describes the first iteration and part of the second one. In the first iteration, we developed LearnWeb2.0 and evaluated it in two Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) courses We followed the multiliteracies approach, using authentic content from a variety of sources and contexts to provide important input for CLIL. We present evaluation design and results for both courses, and discuss how the differences in both scenarios influenced student performance and satisfaction. In the second iteration, we improved LearnWeb2.0 based on these experiences - we describe improvements as well as problems addressed. Finally, we sketch the evaluation planned for the second cycle, and close with a reflection of our experiences with the design-based research approach for developing a collaborative learning environment, and on multiliteracies as a suitable approach for CLIL.},

Today worldwide digital archives have increased in their sizes. As a result, the content annotation would require a large amount of resources. To help reduce the cost associated with the content annotation, we have designed a framework called ARSA (ARchive Social Annotation) to provide a convenient platform for users to annotate digital contents in social networking environment. ARSA adopts the concept of crowdsourcing which allows users to collaborate in content annotation task. The current version of ARSA has been designed and implemented for the Buddhadasa Indapanno Archives (BIA). The contents are in two formats, (1) audio files and (2) image documents of handwritten and typewritten texts. Both contents are related to Buddhadasa's dhamma teaching. ARSA provides a user-friendly and socially connected interface for volunteers to transcribe audio files and image documents. The transcribed texts could be used to implement a search engine for full-text search or used for preparing printed materials.},

We compare JSI against diverse citation-based metrics, and find that JSI significantly correlates with a number of them. These findings indicate that online attention of scholarly articles is related to traditional journal rankings and favors journals with a longer history of scholarly impact. We also find that journal-level altmetrics have strong significant correlations among themselves, compared with the weak correlations among article-level altmetrics. Another finding is that Mendeley and Twitter have the highest usage and coverage of scholarly activities. Among individual altmetrics, we find that the readership of academic social networks have the highest correlations with citation-based metrics.

  abstract  = {Owing to the dynamics of the business environment in which organizations must adapt to changes quickly, the information systems have recently had to adapt to new situations so that they can keep adding value efficiently and effectively. In the light of this scenario, a new discipline called Service-oriented Systems Engineering (SOSE) has emerged in the academic scene and this has highlighted the disciplined, systematic and quantified development of Service-oriented Computing systems. This discipline is divided into other sub-disciplines, one of these sub-disciplines is Service-oriented Requirements Engineering (SORE) and is concerned with defining processes and methodologies to address the question of services requirements from two different perspectives: service consumers and service providers. In the context of SORE, this paper proposes a WS&i*-RGPS approach that explores some alternatives to the descriptions proposed by the Role, Goal, Process and Service (RGPS) metamodels - an approach in SORE. This involves a new definition that seeks to incorporate the advantages of other models -- established in the literature - with RGPS. Accordingly, this new approach outlines the use of the i* framework to describe the Role and Goal layers and shows the use of WS-BPEL/WSDL to describe the process and service layers. The use of the i* framework sets out the goals for managing different aspects of the systems specification. Among its advantages are stability, support in the detection of conflicts, analysis and negotiation. WS-BPEL/WSDL is chosen because of its maturity and widespread use in the state of practice, which increases the chance of this new approach being adopted by industry.},

In this paper we explore the mechanisms that social tagging can trigger to change the behavior of knowledge workers. We argue that social tagging has the potential to activate mechanisms of connection management and sociality in the context of knowledge work. To understand social tagging as a trigger for behavioral change, we explored the recent theoretical perspective of connectivism and connected knowledge. In connectivism connection making and sociality are key elements of knowledge work. Using this perspective we explore the realm of social tagging for knowledge workers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the well-known bag-of-features (BoFs) model is generalized and formulated as a neural network that is composed of three layers: 1) a radial basis function (RBF) layer; 2) an accumulation layer; and 3) a fully connected layer. This formulation allows for decoupling the representation size from the number of used codewords, as well as for better modeling the feature distribution using a separate trainable scaling parameter for each RBF neuron. The resulting network, called retrieval-oriented neural BoF (RN-BoF), is trained using regular back propagation and allows for fast extraction of compact image representations. It is demonstrated that the RN-BoF model is capable of: 1) increasing the object encoding and retrieval speed; 2) reducing the extracted representation size; and 3) increasing the retrieval precision. A symmetry-aware spatial segmentation technique is also proposed to further reduce the encoding time and the storage requirements and allows the method to efficiently scale to large datasets. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques using five different image datasets, including the large-scale YouTube Faces database.},

The aim of this study is to measure the effectiveness of our approach on this kind of social network platform, which has different characteristics from those of other social networking sites. Although the improvement compared to the time-agnostic baseline method is still low, the experiments using a parametric study showed us the benefit of applying a time-aware social profiling process on Twitter. We also found that our method performs well on sparse networks and that the information dynamic influences more the quality of our proposed time-aware method than the relationships dynamic while building the social profile on Twitter.

We carried out evaluations that mainly paid attention on the particularly challenging problem of resources' ambiguity to prove that not all resources shared in folksonomies are relevant resources for Dbpedia ontology.

Such paradigms are based on either categorical or dimensional models. The interest in dimensional models has recently grown a great deal, as they define a semantic relation between concepts through graded descriptions. One problem that affects semantic descriptions is the ambiguity that often arises from using the same descriptor in different contexts. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is important to model and address polysemy, which is the property of words to take on different meanings depending on the use-context. In this paper we propose a Dimensional Contextual Semantic Model for defining semantic relations among descriptors in a context-aware fashion. This model is here used for developing a semantic music search engine. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we compare this engine with two systems that are based on different description models.},

Version-control repositories are essential in supporting this collaboration but cannot satisfactorily address the problem of traceability of interdependencies among the artifacts produced by the individual tools. In this demo, we present a new collaboration tool, WikiDev 2.0, that proposes to address these problems by adopting a wiki as the central platform in which to integrate information about the various artifacts of interest and to present views on this information that cut across the individual tool boundaries. We believe that WikiDev 2.0 will advance the degree of each individual team-member's awareness of the status of the project, thus better supporting the overall team collaboration.},

Till recently, contacts and social relationships were hard to capture and manage by software and, thus, it was infeasible to use them to empower the operation of software. The emergence of social networks made it possible to realise a new kind of software mediated social relationships which would enable what we call "socially-augmented operation". In this position paper, we propose socially-augmented software, which can benefit from network of contacts of users including individuals and organizations to fulfil their requirements. We articulate our view and discuss fundamental concepts of this new paradigm. A set of research challenges to better enable socially-augmented operations in software development will be also presented in the discussion.},

The usual largeness of these collections requires a vast endeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually. As an approach to effectively produce an automated classification of resources, we consider the immense amounts of annotations provided by users on social tagging systems in the form of bookmarks. In this paper, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags to perform a social classification of resources. For this purpose, we have created three large-scale social tagging data sets including tagging data for different types of resources, webpages and books. Those resources are accompanied by categorization data from sound expert-driven taxonomies. We analyze the characteristics of the three social tagging systems and perform an analysis on the usefulness of social tags to perform a social classification of resources that resembles the classification by experts as much as possible. We analyze six different representations using tags and compare to other data sources by using three different settings of SVM classifiers. Finally, we explore combinations of different data sources with tags using classifier committees to best classify the resources.},

  abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of location -based social networks. A well-formed representation of location knowledge is desired to cater to the need of location sensing, browsing, navigation and querying. In this paper, we aim to study the semantics of point-of-interest (POI) by exploiting the abundant heterogeneous user generated content (UGC) from different social networks. Our idea is to explore the text descriptions, photos, user check-in patterns, and venue context for location semantic similarity measurement. We argue that the venue semantics play an important role in user check-in behavior. Based on this argument, a unified POI recommendation algorithm is proposed by incorporating venue semantics as a regularizer. In addition to deriving user preference based on user-venue check-in information, we place special emphasis on location semantic similarity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of location semantic similarity and location recommendation over a real world dataset collected from Foursquare and Instagram. Experimental results show that the UGC information can well characterize the venue semantics, which help to improve the recommendation performance.},

Recently, the sharp increase of network scale has become a great challenge for traditional community discovery algorithms. Label propagation algorithm is a semi-supervised machine learning method, which has linear time complexity when coping with large scale networks. However, the output result has less stability and the quality of the output communities still remains to be improved. Therefore, we propose a novel core-leader based label propagation algorithm for community detection called CLBLPA. Firstly, we find core leaders of potential community by using a greedy method. Then we utilize the label influence potential to guide the process of label propagation. Thus we can accelerate the convergence of algorithm and improve the stability of the output. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real networks show that CLBLPA can significantly improve the quality of the output communities.},

We refer to this new type of online tool as a social voting advice application (SVAA). SVAAs extend VAAs by providing (a) community-based recommendations, (b) comparison of users' political opinions, and (c) a channel of user communication. In addition, SVAAs enriched with data mining modules, can operate as citizen sensors recording the sentiment of the electorate on issues and candidates. Drawing on VAA datasets generated by the Preference Matcher research consortium, we evaluate the results of the first VAA-Choose4Greece-which incorporated social voting features and was launched during the landmark Greek national elections of 2012. We demonstrate how an SVAA can provide community based features and, at the same time, serve as a citizen sensor. Evaluation of the proposed techniques is realized on a series of datasets collected from various VAAs, including Choose4Greece.

Each type of basic structure is related to information scattering, information gathering, or information transmission. We visualized and analyzed the structure of information diffusion networks extracted for other topics. Furthermore, we characterize the information diffusion properties by using the rank correlation coefficient, precision, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and mean average precision (MAP) of three types of information sources: official sites, news sites, and CGMs. We found that the three information diffusion properties have different characteristics and give priority to different types of information sources.},

However, such support walks a fine line: if it provides too little information software engineers will not be able to collaborate effectively, yet if it provides too much, an information overload can occur. To further complicate matters, the information needs of software engineers dynamically change based on their current activity, context and focus. Therefore we assist tool developers by investigating and reporting on the prioritization of information for distributed software engineers based on their current activity and status.

  abstract  = {Co-clustering was proposed to simultaneously cluster objects and features to explore inter-correlated patterns. For example, by analyzing the blog click-through data, one finds the group of users who are interested in a specific group of blogs in order to perform applications such as recommendations. However, it is usually very difficult to achieve good co-clustering quality by just analyzing the object-feature correlation data due to the sparsity of the data and the noise. Meanwhile, one may have some prior knowledge that indicates the internal structure of the co-clusters. For instance, one may find user cluster information from the social network system, and the blog-blog similarity from the social tags or contents. This prior information provides some supervision toward the co-cluster structures, and may help reduce the effect of sparsity and noise. However, most co-clustering algorithms do not use this information and may produce unmeaningful results. In this paper we study the problem of finding the optimal co-clusters when some objects and features are believed to be in the same cluster a priori. A matrix decomposition based approach is proposed to formulate as a trace minimization problem, and solve it efficiently with the selected eigenvectors. The asymptotic complexity of the proposed approach is the same as co-clustering without constraints. Experiments include graph-pattern co-clustering and document-word co-clustering. For instance, in graph-pattern data set, the proposed model can improve the normalized mutual information by as much as 5.5 times and 10 times faster than two naive solutions that expand the edges and vertices in the graphs.},

  abstract = {Research project selection is an important task for government and private research funding agencies. When a large number of research proposals are received, it is common to group them according to their similarities in research disciplines. The grouped proposals are then assigned to the appropriate experts for peer review. Current methods for grouping proposals are based on manual matching of similar research discipline areas and/or keywords. However, the exact research discipline areas of the proposals cannot often be accurately designated by the applicants due to their subjective views and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, rich information in the proposals' full text can be used effectively. Text-mining methods have been proposed to solve the problem by automatically classifying text documents, mainly in English. However, these methods have limitations when dealing with non-English language texts, e.g., Chinese research proposals. This paper presents a novel ontology-based text-mining approach to cluster research proposals based on their similarities in research areas. The method is efficient and effective for clustering research proposals with both English and Chinese texts. The method also includes an optimization model that considers applicants' characteristics for balancing proposals by geographical regions. The proposed method is tested and validated based on the selection process at the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

  abstract  = {It is a widely held belief among designers of social tagging systems that tag clouds represent a useful tool for navigation. This is evident in, for example, the increasing number of tagging systems offering tag clouds for navigational purposes, which hints towards an implicit assumption that tag clouds support efficient navigation. In this paper, we examine and test this assumption from a network-theoretic perspective, and show that in many cases it does not hold. We first model navigation in tagging systems as a bipartite graph of tags and resources and then simulate the navigation process in such a graph. We use network-theoretic properties to analyse the navigability of three tagging datasets with regard to different user interface restrictions imposed by tag clouds. Our results confirm that tag resource networks have efficient navigation properties in theory, but they also show that popular user interface decisions (such as “pagination” combined with reverse-chronological listing of resources) significantly impair the potential of tag clouds as a useful tool for navigation. Based on our findings, we identify a number of avenues for further research and the design of novel tag cloud construction algorithms. Our work is relevant for researchers interested in navigability of emergent hypertext structures, and for engineers seeking to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.},

  abstract = {In these days, much of the information published on the Web is published on social media, represented through social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, to name only the most prominent. Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics; for example, Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called tweets are exchanged. The message labels, called hashtags, can be used to identify the subject of the message. The message may also include links to other resources that expand the original content or show interesting information. Another kind of information present in Twitter is the relationship between users, the most common of which is a non-reciprocal relationship named “following.” The scope of this paper is to use the information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend open educational resources, which will be used in the StartUp project. The StartUp project (intelligent training needs assessment and open educational resources to foster entrepreneurship) is co-funded with support from the European Commission under the Lifelong Learning Programme, which has a specific objective to provide effective open educational resources corresponding to individual learning needs. The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this paper through the use of linked data that allow retrieving resources and link them with other external sources, graphs that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis, a technique used to discover relevant information that goes beyond individual properties. The results obtained are a set of recommendations about users (identified as experts), hashtags (thematically related), and URLs (digital resources), according to the main competence areas defined by StartUp. This information will form part of the learning paths provided by the project platfor- .},

  abstract = {Large-scale user contributed images with tags are easily available on photo sharing websites. However, the noisy or incomplete correspondence between the images and tags prohibits them from being leveraged for precise image retrieval and effective management. To tackle the problem of tag refinement, we propose a method of Ranking based Multi-correlation Tensor Factorization (RMTF), to jointly model the ternary relations among user, image, and tag, and further to precisely reconstruct the user-aware image-tag associations as a result. Since the user interest or background can be explored to eliminate the ambiguity of image tags, the proposed RMTF is believed to be superior to the traditional solutions, which only focus on the binary image-tag relations. During the model estimation, we employ a ranking based optimization scheme to interpret the tagging data, in which the pair-wise qualitative difference between positive and negative examples is used, instead of the point-wise 0/1 confidence. Specifically, the positive examples are directly decided by the observed user-image-tag interrelations, while the negative ones are collected with respect to the most semantically and contextually irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on a benchmark Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for tag refinement. We also show attractive performances on two potential applications as the by-products of the ternary relation analysis.},

These systems use ranks or tags each user assign to different resources to make predictions. Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents, tag, organize, share and search for contents, are becoming more popular. These social tagging systems have a lot of valuable information, but the data expansion in them is very fast and this has led to the need for recommender systems that will predict what each user may like or need make these suggestions to them. One of the problems in these systems is: “how much can we rely on the similar users, are they trustworthy?”. In this article we use trust metric, which we conclude from users' tagging behavior, beside similarities to give suggestions. Results show considering trust in a collaborative system can lead to better performance in generating suggestions.},

In this chapter, information search on the Internet is used to illustrate how a theoretical framework of these two conditions can assist our understanding of cognitive search. Discussion begins with information foraging theory (IFT), which predicts how general symbolic structures may exist in an information environment and how the searcher may use these structures to search for information. A computational model called SNIF-ACT (developed based on IFT) is then presented and provides a good match to online information search for specific target information. Because a further component important to cognitive search is the ability to detect and learn useful structures in the environment, discussion follows on how IFT can be extended to explain search behavior that involves incremental learning of the search environment. Illustration is provided on how different forms of semantic structures may exist in the World Wide Web, and how human searchers can learn from these structures to improve their search. Finally, the SNIFACT model is extended to characterize directed and exploratory information foraging behavior in information environments.},

The importance of the web itself as a communication medium and for hosting an increasingly wide array of documents, from journal articles to holiday brochures, needs no introduction. Given this huge and easily accessible source of information, there are limitless possibilities for measuring or counting on a huge scale (e.g., the number of web sites, the number of web pages, the number of blogs) or on a smaller scale (e.g., the number of web sites in Ireland, the number of web pages in the CNN web site, the number of blogs mentioning Barack Obama before the 2008 presidential campaign). This book argues that it can be useful for social scientists to measure aspects of the web and explains how this can be achieved on both a small and large scale. The book is intended for social scientists with research topics that are wholly or p rtly online (e.g., social networks, news, political communication) and social scientists with offline research topics with an online reflection, even if this is not a core component (e.g., diaspora communities, consumer culture, linguistic change). The book is also intended for library and information science students in the belief that the knowledge and techniques described will be useful for them to guide and aid other social scientists in their research. In addition, the techniques and issues are all directly relevant to library and information science research problems.

Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

Samples were taken from 50 English-language Web pages in the social bookmarking service Delicious. The top 7 tags were extracted from each Web page that was tagged as music, photography, games, books and videos. Via the results of the tag analysis of this study, relationship between tags and user interests were demonstrated. TagReel employed a radial visualization method, which has the advantage of giving an overview of the whole cluster of connection among tags. TagReel can represent the semantic concept of connection between tags and between interests.

Therefore, it is challenging to resist tricky spam attacks in tagging systems. This paper proposes a novel spam-proof tagging system, which can provide high-quality tag search results even under tricky attacks, based on four key insights: demotion-based strategy, reputation, altruistic users and social networking. Specifically, our system upgrades/degrades the ranks of correct/incorrect content items in search results through introducing personalized users' reliability degrees and responsible users, thus avoiding clients pick unwanted content. Experimental results illustrated our system could effectively defend against tricky tag spam attacks and work better than current prevalent tag search models.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to integrating user interests into search within a recommender system that is guided by the semantic representation of the user and the content. In addition, our research tackles two problems of creating any recommender system: (a) the initial stage problem (how to provide recommendations to a user if the system hasn't been used yet) and (b) user context (providing the same user with different recommendations based on the context of their recent activity). Also the design of our recommender system is modular. It integrates and accommodates user's preferences by using User Relevance Feedback. Finally, we describe how the personalization aspects can increase the recommendation quality.},

  abstract = {In hierarchical classification, the output labels reside on a tree- or directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured hierarchy. On testing, the prediction paths of a given test example may be required to end at leaf nodes of the label hierarchy. This is called mandatory leaf node prediction (MLNP) and is particularly useful, when the leaf nodes have much stronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes. However, while there have been a lot of MLNP methods in hierarchical multiclass classification, performing MLNP in hierarchical multilabel classification is difficult. In this paper, we propose novel MLNP algorithms that consider the global label hierarchy structure. We show that the joint posterior probability over all the node labels can be efficiently maximized by dynamic programming for label trees, or greedy algorithm for label DAGs. In addition, both algorithms can be further extended for the minimization of the expected symmetric loss. Experiments are performed on real-world MLNP data sets with label trees and label DAGs. The proposed method consistently outperforms other hierarchical and flat multilabel classification methods.},

  abstract  = {In a social tagging system, resources (such as photos, video and web pages) are associated with tags. These tags allow the resources to be effectively searched through tag-based keyword matching using traditional IR techniques. We note that in many such systems, tags of a resource are often assigned by a diverse audience of causal users (taggers). This leads to two issues that gravely affect the effectiveness of resource retrieval: (1) Noise: tags are picked from an uncontrolled vocabulary and are assigned by untrained taggers. The tags are thus noisy features in resource retrieval. (2) A multitude of aspects: different taggers focus on different aspects of a resource. Representing a resource using a flattened bag of tags ignores this important diversity of taggers. To improve the effectiveness of resource retrieval in social tagging systems, we propose CubeLSI - a technique that extends traditional LSI to include taggers as another dimension of feature space of resources. We compare CubeLSI against a number of other tag-based retrieval models and show that CubeLSI significantly outperforms the other models in terms of retrieval accuracy. We also prove two interesting theorems that allow CubeLSI to be very efficiently computed despite the much enlarged feature space it employs.},

Along with an efficient and personalized recommendation algorithm, the service also features result diversification, relevance feedback, visualization for exploratory search. We explain the design criteria and rationale we employed to make the theadvisor a useful and scalable web service with a thorough evaluation.},

We employ a probabilistic model to characterize the knowledge of each labeler through which a weak labeler can learn complementary knowledge from a stronger peer.

As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, automatically classifying music by genre is a challenging problem. The traditional approaches which solely depending on low-level audio features may not be able to obtain satisfactory results. In recent years, the social tags have emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the web. So, in this paper we propose a novel multi-modal music genre classification approach which uses the acoustic features and the social tags together for classifying music by genre. For the audio content-based classification, we design a new feature selection algorithm called IBFFS (Interaction Based Forward Feature Selection). This algorithm selects the features depending on the pre-computed rules which considering the interaction between the different features. In addition, we are interested in another aspect, that is how performing automatic music genre classification depending on the available tag data. Two classification methods based on the social tags (including music-tags and artist-tags) which crawled from website Last.fm are developed in our work: (1) we use the generative probabilistic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze the music-tags. Then, we can obtain the probability of every tag belonging to each music genre. (2) The starting point of the second method is that music's artist is often associated with music genres more closely. Therefore, we can compute the similarity between the artist-tag vector- to infer which genre the music belongs to. At last, our experimental results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-modal music genre classification approach.},

SNPs have two unique characteristics: frequent content update and small world phenomenon. However, existing works are not able to support these two features simultaneously. To address this problem, we develop a general framework to enable real time personalized top-k query. Our framework is based on a general ranking function that incorporates time freshness, social relevance and textual similarity. To ensure efficient update and query processing, there are two key challenges. The first is to design an index structure that is update-friendly while supporting instant query processing. The second is to efficiently compute the social relevance in a complex graph. To address these challenges, we first design a novel 3D cube inverted index to support efficient pruning on the three dimensions simultaneously. Then we devise a cube based threshold algorithm to retrieve the top-k results, and propose several pruning techniques to optimize the social distance computation, whose cost dominates the query processing. Furthermore, we optimize the 3D index via a hierarchical partition method to enhance our pruning on the social dimension. Extensive experimental results on two real world large datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of our proposed solution.},

Genre classification is especially interesting in the domain of narrative content which is characterized by a large number of ambiguous and overlapping categories.

In this paper we investigate two different information folksonomy sources for the movie domain namely: keywords and tags, the first of which is user annotated and expert monitored whereas the latter is non-monitored. A comparison is performed to assess the efficacy of both sources in solving this multi-label classification problem and it is found that the in spite of being expert monitored and better structured, keywords are worse predictors of the genres of movies than tags in most cases.},

  abstract  = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence of participatory Web and social media, bringing people together in many creative ways. Millions of users are playing, tagging, working, and socializing online, demonstrating new forms of collaboration, communication, and intelligence that were hardly imaginable just a short time ago. Social media also helps reshape business models, sway opinions and emotions, and opens up numerous possibilities to study human interaction and collective behavior in an unparalleled scale. This lecture, from a data mining perspective, introduces characteristics of social media, reviews representative tasks of computing with social media, and illustrates associated challenges. It introduces basic concepts, presents state-of-the-art algorithms with easy-to-understand examples, and recommends effective evaluation methods. In particular, we discuss graph-based community detection techniques and many important extensions that handle dynamic, heterogeneous networks i social media. We also demonstrate how discovered patterns of communities can be used for social media mining. The concepts, algorithms, and methods presented in this lecture can help harness the power of social media and support building socially-intelligent systems. This book is an accessible introduction to the study of emph{community detection and mining in social media}. It is an essential reading for students, researchers, and practitioners in disciplines and applications where social media is a key source of data that piques our curiosity to understand, manage, innovate, and excel. This book is supported by additional materials, including lecture slides, the complete set of figures, key references, some toy data sets used in the book, and the source code of representative algorithms.

  abstract  = {Visual labeling or automated visual annotation is of great importance to the efficient access and management of multimedia content. Many methods and techniques have been proposed for image annotation in the last decade and they have shown reasonable performance on standard datasets. Great progress has been made especially in recent couple of years with the development of deep learning models for image content analysis and extraction of content-based concept labels. However, concept objects labels are much more friendly to machine than to users. We consider that more relevant and user-friendly visual labels need to include “context” descriptors. In this study we explore the possibilities to leverage social media content as a resource for visual labeling. We developed a tag extraction system that applies heuristic rules and term weighting method to extract image tags from associated Tweet. The system retrieves tweet-image pairs from public Twitter accounts, analyzes the Tweet, and generates labels for the images. We elaborate on different visual labeling methods, tag analysis and tag refinement methods.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for music recommendation. Firstly, we describe an approach for creating music recommendations based on user-supplied tags that are augmented with a hierarchical structure extracted for top level genres from Dbpedia. In this structure, each genre is represented by its stylistic origins, typical instruments, derivative forms, sub genres and fusion genres. We use this well-organized structure in dimensionality reduction in user and item profiling. We compare two recommenders, one using our method and the other using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in dimensionality reduction. The recommender using our approach outperforms the other. In addition to different dimensionality reduction methods, we evaluate the recommenders with different user profiling methods. Moreover, our approach collects personal interests (favorite movies and television series) from the Face book profiles. These user profiles are then used to find the similarity between users. At the end, items belonging to the most similar users' profiles and having a high score against users' profiles are recommended. Thus, we have focused on a hybrid system using tag-based contextual information of music tracks and user interests acquired from Face book profiles. Initial results are promising such that using similarities of users affects the recommendation positively.},

The use of fuzzy similarity measures allows the correct identification of syntactic variations when tag lengths are greater or equal than five symbols, been inadequate for smaller length tags. This article presents a method that combines both fuzzy similarity and cosine measures in order to provide a proper classification of tags even with smaller tag lengths. This method allows the proper classification of the 95% of the syntactic variations of tags analyzed in the experiments.},

We heavily rely on search engines but most existing search tools are key-word based and they often return search results with low precision and recall. The emerging semantic tagging technology provides an automatic way to generate semantic tags from text. It has drawn more and more interest from text mining research communities. It is critical to study how to utilize semantic tags to improve text mining including clustering, which helps users to enhance their experience of searching and browsing documents. Unfortunately, most previous works on text clustering merely based on content information. A few recent researches take user-generated tags into account, however user generated tags are often noisy, inconsistent, redundant and lack of semantic information and hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a Semantic Text Mining (STeM) framework to generate semantic tags for given documents and then utilize the semantic tags to improve text clustering. Different from the previous works, we represent a document by a combination of domains and high quality noun phrases. We investigate the performance of our methods in two different datasets and the results are evaluated by normalized mutual information. Experiment results demonstrated that our proposed method substantially outperformed the traditional Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) term vector based clustering. We find that incorporating semantic information into document representation is critical to improve the performance of text clustering.},

A number of computational models are developed to evaluate the accuracy of different content or context cues in predicting emotional state, using 40,000 pieces of music listening records collected from the social blogging website LiveJournal. Our study shows that it is feasible to computationally model the latent structure underlying music listening and mood regulation. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the content-based and context-based models attains 0.5462 and 0.6851, respectively.

Consumers were assumed to communicate with other consumers selectively using one of three policies: random selection, similar-level selection, and higher-level selection. A basic simulation showed that the most effective policy for selecting communication partners depends on the characteristics of the goods under consideration. An agent-based simulation showed that an effective word-of-mouth policy also depends on the characteristics of the goods under consideration. These findings clarify how consumers deal with cognitive limitations in the face of the massive amount of information now available.},

Nevertheless, in order to be able to understand how a social tagging system performs and whether it can deliver the aforementioned goal, it is important to be able to investigate the behaviour of the tag vocabulary, which constitutes the core component of a social tagging system. Within this context, many studies have been conducted regarding the growth of the tag vocabularies of social tagging systems but there are only sporadic studies for investigating this issue in the field of LORs.

We focus on the notion of user preferences and show that the order that users list tags on images is correlated to the order of preference over the tags that they provided for the image. While this observation is not completely surprising, to our knowledge, we are the first to explore this aspect of user tagging behavior systematically and report empirical results to support this observation. We argue that this observation can be exploited to help advance the image tagging (and related) communities.

  abstract  = {This book is the third of a three-part series on taxonomies, and covers putting your taxonomy into use in as many ways as possible to maximize retrieval for your users. Chapter 1 suggests several items to research and consider before you start your implementation and integration process. It explores the different pieces of software that you will need for your system and what features to look for in each. Chapter 2 launches with a discussion of how taxonomy terms can be used within a workflow, connecting two—or more—taxonomies, and intelligent coordination of platforms and taxonomies. Microsoft SharePoint is a widely used and popular program, and I consider their use of taxonomies in this chapter. Following that is a discussion of taxonomies and semantic integration and then the relationship between indexing and the hierarchy of a taxonomy. Chapter 3 (“How is a Taxonomy Connected to Search?”) provides discussions and examples of putting taxonomies into use i practical applications. It discusses displaying content based on search, how taxonomy is connected to search, using a taxonomy to guide a searcher, tools for search, including search engines, crawlers and spiders, and search software, the parts of a search-capable system, and then how to assemble that search-capable system. This chapter also examines how to measure quality in search, the different kinds of search, and theories on search from several famous theoreticians—two from the 18th and 19th centuries, and two contemporary. Following that is a section on inverted files, parsing, discovery, and clustering. While you probably don’t need a comprehensive understanding of these concepts to build a solid, workable system, enough information is provided for the reader to see how they fit into the overall scheme. This chapter concludes with a look at faceted search and some possibilities for search interfaces. Chapter 4, “Implementing a Taxonomy in a Database or on Website,” starts where many content systems really should—with the authors, or at least the people who create the content. This chapter discusses matching up various groups of related data to form connections, data visualization and text analytics, and mobile and e-commerce applications for taxonomies. Finally, Chapter 5 presents some educated guesses about the future of knowledge organization. Table of Contents: List of Figures / Preface / Acknowledgments / On Your Mark, Get Ready …. WAIT!

  abstract = {Medical information retrieval plays an increasingly important role to help physicians and domain experts to better access medical-related knowledge and information, and support decision making. Integrating the medical knowledge bases has the potential to improve the information retrieval performance through incorporating medical domain knowledge for relevance assessment. However, this is not a trivial task due to the challenges to effectively utilize the domain knowledge in the medical knowledge bases. In this paper, we proposed a novel medical information retrieval system with a two-stage query expansion strategy, which is able to effectively model and incorporate the latent semantic associations to improve the performance. This system consists of two parts. First, we applied a heuristic approach to enhance the widely used pseudo relevance feedback method for more effective query expansion, through iteratively expanding the queries to boost the similarity score between queries and documents. Second, to improve the retrieval performance with structured knowledge bases, we presented a latent semantic relevance model based on tensor factorization to identify semantic association patterns under sparse settings. These identified patterns are then used as inference paths to trigger knowledge-based query expansion in medical information retrieval. Experiments with the TREC CDS 2014 data set: 1) showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly better than the baseline system and the systems reported in TREC CDS 2014 conference, and is comparable with the state-of-the-art systems and 2) demonstrated the capability of tensor-based semantic enrichment methods for medical information retrieval tasks.},

Since social tags are usually as signed by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation is another useful information for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem. The results of audio tag annotation and retrieval experiments demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

Recommendation systems tackle the problem of trying to identify relevant resources from the vast number of choices available online. In this study, we propose a new recommendation model that personalizes recommendations and improves the user experience by analyzing the context when a user wishes to access multimedia content. We conducted empirical analysis on a dataset from last.fm to demonstrate the use of latent preferences for ranking items under a given context. Additionally, we use an optimization function to maximize the mean average precision measure of the resulted recommendation. Experimental results show a potential improvement to the quality of the recommendation in terms of accuracy when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, it is often difficult to take independently developed services and compose them, since they may not work together correctly. For service composition to occur, the services in question must be designed and developed in a manner that facilitates their composition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for service design and composition that combines top-down and bottom-up elements. Our approach is driven by faceted, tag-based functional requirements provided by end-users. These requirements describe, at a high-level, the families of compositions that end-users desire. The requirements kick off a top-down service development lifecycle, where enterprise architects and service developers design, develop and test workflows and services, possibly reusing existing flows and services in the process. At runtime, end-users can specify goals, which are satisfied through a bottom-up composition of flows from the available services. The composed flows include those explicitly designed by the architects as well as new ones that are assembled in a serendipitous manner from the available services. With examples from a case study in the financial services domain, we demonstrate our approach for designing and developing services that can be composed into myriad workflows based on end-user goals.},

Finally, highly desired exhibition halls are personalized recommended to proper visitor. The proposed recommender system consists of three modules including relevance module, quality module and integration module. The relevance module is developed to measure the relationship of an automobile exhibition and a visitor, while the quality module is constructed to analyze the quality of each automobile exhibition. The integration module is to combine two modules above for appropriate automobile exhibition. The proposed approach is well validated using a real world dataset, and compared with several baseline models. Our experimental results indicate that in terms of the well-known evaluation metrics, the proposed method can achieves more useful and feasible recommendation results, and our finding highlights that the proposed method can help both visitors to find a more appropriate automobile exhibition halls, and manage officers to reduce more management cost.},

Two very popular approaches are the introduction of sophisticated categorization systems (e.g., fruity, woody, and peppery for wines) along with manual product classification performed by experts and the addition of user feedback mechanisms (e.g., ratings or textual reviews). While user feedback typically is easy to collect, for purposes of product search, it cannot be used as easily as this is possible with a systematic categorization scheme.

Our semi-supervised method combines advanced data extraction methods with state-of-the-art classification algorithms and only requires a small number of training examples to be created manually by experts.

Using actual long-term and short-term perfSONAR traces, we analyze recommendation results and show: a) how the content-based filter recommends the most pertinent traces based on their attributes, and b) the time-variant characteristics of domain reputation. Finally, using synthetic traces, we show the effectiveness of our proposed measurements recommendation scheme in accurately identifying anomaly events for an exemplar use case, and also show how our content filter based recommendation scheme performs better in terms of false alarms in comparison to: a) recommendations that consider partial trace features for filtering, and b) greedy recommendation approaches based on random trace selection.},

In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.},

Traditional rating-oriented methods predict user ratings on items, but they fail to capture user preference among different items. This paper regards recommendation problem as a ranking task and proposes a new ranking-oriented collaborative filtering framework based on ranking aggregation methods. In this framework, recommendation lists are generated according to item rankings given by users who are similar to the target user. Then, a two-step method called BordaRank is proposed to further explain the framework. The method first uses item collaborative filtering to predict unknown ratings and then uses Borda count method to aggregate item rankings of neighbors. Finally, BordaRank is modified as a pure ranking-oriented method, which could be directly applied on the sparse rating matrix without rating prediction as an intermediate step. The methods are evaluated on real world movie rating data. Experimental results show that BordaRank improves the precision and recall of original rating-oriented methods and modified BordaRank also outperforms traditional methods.},

However, the limited expertise of contributors can lead to poor quality or misleading data being submitted. Subsequently, the scientific community often perceive citizen science data as not worthy of being used in serious scientific research. In this paper, we describe a technological framework that combines data quality improvements and trust metrics to enhance the reliability of citizen science data. We describe how trust models provide a simple and effective mechanism for measuring the reliability of community-generated data. We also describe filtering services that remove untrustworthy data, and enable confident re-use of the data. The resulting services are evaluated in the context of the Coral Watch project which uses volunteers to collect data on coral reef bleaching.},

  abstract  = {Graph classification is becoming increasingly popular due to the rapidly rising applications involving data with structural dependency. The wide spread of the graph applications and the inherent complex relationships between graph objects have made the labels of the graph data expensive and/or difficult to obtain, especially for applications involving dynamic changing graph records. While labeled graphs are limited, the copious amounts of unlabeled graphs are often easy to obtain with trivial efforts. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a stream based graph classification model by combining both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Our method, called gSLU, employs an ensemble based framework to partition graph streams into a number of graph chunks each containing some labeled and unlabeled graphs. For each individual chunk, we propose a minimum-redundancy subgraph feature selection module to select a set of informative subgraph features to build a classifier. To tackle the concept drifting in graph streams, an instance level weighting mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the instance weight, through which the subgraph feature selection can emphasize on difficult graph samples. The classifiers built from different graph chunks form an ensemble for graph stream classification. Experiments on real-world graph streams demonstrate clear benefits of using minimum-redundancy subgraph features to build accurate classifiers. By employing instance level weighting, our graph ensemble model can effectively adapt to the concept drifting in the graph stream for classification.},

As such, a large proportion of the information it contains is not particularly relevant to many users and in fact is perceived as unwanted 'noise' by many. There has been increased research interest in predicting whether tweets are relevant, newsworthy or credible, using a variety of models and methods. In this paper, we focus on an analysis that highlights the utility of the individual features in Twitter such as hash tags, retweets and mentions for predicting credibility. We first describe a context-based evaluation of the utility of a set of features for predicting manually provided credibility assessments on a corpus of microblog tweets. This is followed by an evaluation of the distribution/presence of each feature across 8 diverse crawls of tweet data. Last, an analysis of feature distribution across dyadic pairs of tweets and retweet chains of various lengths is described. Our results show that the best indicators of credibility include URLs, mentions, retweets and tweet length and that features occur more prominently in data describing emergency and unrest situations.},

Tags have proven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching, mining and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users, and as a result, most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources, while most of the resources receive few tags. Crucially, this incomplete tagging on resources can severely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag, an incentive-based tagging system, which aims at improving tagging quality of resources, by incentivizing taggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In our demonstration, we will show how our system allows users to use simple but powerful strategies to significantly improve the tagging quality of resources.},

This approach uses currently available and free tools in this new application. Co-occurrence networks are a method for visualizing relationships between concepts within written material. The results of a co-occurrence analysis are a network that reflects the relationships between words based on meaning similarities among words and text segments. To illustrate this approach, I applied the methodology of a systematic literature review search that resulted in 391 unique journal articles, books, and reports on identity published in the period from 1995 to 2015. The abstracts, titles, and keywords of these journals were analyzed via linguistic analysis to create a word co-occurrence network of these articles related to identity in science and engineering. Clusters within this network were identified based on word frequency. The results of this research illustrate a hole in the current identity literature in understanding diversity beyond traditional definitions of race, class, and gender. This method has the potential to powerfully convey and embed information about large amounts of data in a single image and offers a new way to report findings from a systematic literature review.},

One way to improve search in bookmarking systems is by adding more metadata to the user-defined tags to enhance tag quality. Such an approach would add value by incorporating information about the content of the resource while retaining the original user-defined tag. Tags automatically extracted from the resource could be the main source for tag enhancement. This paper describes how users' tags can be enhanced with metadata in the form of additional tags automatically extracted from the original document. An evaluation study shows how the enhanced tag set improved user searching in comparison to using only user-defined tags.},

Answers service. We found that community tagging is related to higher levels of social interactions amongst users. Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics. Thus, appropriate care needs to be taken when designing search, browsing, and recommender features for question discovery.},

This paper proposes a design of knowledge by using ontology to overcome this issue. The nature of ontology structure allows us to map functional requirements with technical features of the product. Based on our user study, most of expert users (familiar with product technical features) and novice users (not familiar with product technical features) perceive that the CRS based on our proposed knowledge design is more useful than that of the recommender system based on the technical features.},

  abstract = {Social tagging systems (STSs) allow users to annotate information items (songs, pictures, etc.) to provide them item/tag or even user recommendations. STSs consist of three main types of entities: 1) users; 2) items; and 3) tags. These data usually are represented by a three-order tensor, on which Tucker decomposition (TD) models are performed, such as higher order singular value decomposition. However, TD models require cubic computations for the tensor decomposition. Furthermore, TD models suffer from sparsity that incurs in social tagging data. Thus, TD models have limited applicability to large-scale datasets, due to their computational complexity and data sparsity. In this paper, we use two different ways to compute similarity/distance between tags (i.e., the term frequency - inverse document frequency vector space model and the semantic similarity of tags using the ontology of WordNet). Moreover, to reduce the size of the tensor's dimensions and its data sparsity, we use clustering methods (i.e., k-means, spectral clustering, etc.) for discovering tag clusters, which are the intermediaries between a user's profile and items. Thus, instead of inserting the tag dimension in the tensor, we insert the tag cluster dimension, which is smaller and has less noise, resulting to better item recommendation accuracy. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against a state-of-the-art item recommendation algorithm with two real datasets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Collaborative filtering recommendation technique is one the most successful and popular approaches. However, collaborative filtering approach only considers whether or not a user likes a specific resource but does not take into account the reason why she/he likes it. Social tagging systems, a well-known mechanism in various Web 2.0 applications, play a crucial role to deal with this issue. In response, some prior studies have tried to incorporate social tagging systems into traditional recommendation approaches to enhance their performance. In this study, we investigate the effect of tag completeness in tag-based recommendation approach by proposing a tag-expansion-based personalized recommendation (TE-PR) technique to enrich user profiles and resource profiles. According to our empirical evaluation results using CiteULike data set, the tag-expansion-based approach indeed improves the performance of recommendation techniques. Moreover, the expanded resource profiles have significant positive contributions on recommendation performance.},

As an initial attempt to answer the two questions, we conduct an experimental study using a video search engine which is capable of learning concept detectors from social media, be it socially tagged videos or socially tagged images. Within the video search engine we investigate six strategies of positive examples selection. The performance is evaluated on the challenging TRECVID benchmark 2011 with 400 hours of Internet videos. The new experiments lead to novel and nontrivial findings: (1) tagged images are a better source for learning video concepts from the web, (2) selecting tag relevant examples as positives for learning video concepts is always beneficial and it can be done automatically and (3) the best source and strategy compare favorably against several present-day methods.},

While automatic approaches at best are only able to retrieve information that is already contained in the source code, manual tagging could add valuable extra information from qualified expertise of the developers. However, tagging code is tedious. To make code tagging more fun, we introduce a social gasification approach: developers independently tag code fragments and are rewarded if their solutions conform to the solution of other developers. We implemented the game as a Facebook plug-in. A pilot user study suggests that the game mechanics are motivating and promote the proposition of reasonable tags.},

However, when information accumulates and an argumentation network becomes considerably large, it will cost tremendous time and effort for the stakeholder to read and comprehend all existing arguments. In this paper, we propose methods to implement a recommendation component built into an intelligent argumentation system. The recommendation component can automatically assist a stakeholder to better understand the current state of an argumentation by summarizing and identifying a subset of existing arguments that are relevant to the stakeholder. Thus, our proposed work will allow a stakeholder to efficiently and effectively express his/her thoughts in an intelligent argumentation system in relevant argumentation thread. We also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation component, and the empirical results indicate it is effective according to a real dataset.},

Tag-based image search is an important method to find images contributed by social users in such social websites. However, how to make the top ranked result relevant and, with diversity, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a social re-ranking system for tag-based image retrieval with the consideration of an image's relevance and diversity. We aim at re-ranking images according to their visual information, semantic information, and social clues. The initial results include images contributed by different social users. Usually each user contributes several images. First, we sort these images by inter-user re-ranking. Users that have higher contribution to the given query rank higher. Then we sequentially implement intra-user re-ranking on the ranked user's image set, and only the most relevant image from each user's image set is selected. These selected images compose the final retrieved results. We build an inverted index structure for the social image dataset to accelerate the searching process. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset show that our social re-ranking method is effective and efficient.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral anomaly detection (AD) is an important problem in remote sensing field. It can make full use of the spectral differences to discover certain potential interesting regions without any target priors. Traditional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detectors assume the background spectrum distribution conforms to a Gaussian distribution. However, this and other similar distributions may not be satisfied for the real hyperspectral images. Moreover, the background statistics are susceptible to contamination of anomaly targets which will lead to a high false-positive rate. To address these intrinsic problems, this paper proposes a novel AD method based on the graph theory. We first construct a vertex- and edge-weighted graph and then utilize a pixel selection process to locate the anomaly targets. Two contributions are claimed in this paper: 1) no background distributions are required which makes the method more adaptive and 2) both the vertex and edge weights are considered which enables a more accurate detection performance and better robustness to noise. Intensive experiments on the simulated and real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other benchmark competitors. In addition, the robustness of the proposed method has been validated by using various window sizes. This experimental result also demonstrates the valuable characteristic of less computational complexity and less parameter tuning for real applications.},

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. Moreover, traditional recommender systems consider only the rating information, resulting in the loss of flexibility. Tagging has recently emerged as a popular way for users to annotate, organize and share resources on the Web. Several research tasks have shown that tags can represent userspsila judgments about Web contents quite accurately. In the light of the facts that both the rating activity and tagging activity can reflect userspsila opinions, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach called TagRec based on a unified probabilistic matrix factorization by utilizing both userspsila tagging information and rating information. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets. Furthermore, experimental results on MovieLens data set show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {Many images uploaded to social networks are related to travel, since people consider traveling to be an important event in their life. However, a significant amount of travel images on the Internet lack proper geographical annotations or tags. In many cases, the images are tagged manually. One way to make this time-consuming manual tagging process more efficient is to propagate tags from a small set of tagged images to the larger set of untagged images automatically. In this paper, we present a system for automatic geotag propagation in images based on the similarity between image content (famous landmarks) and its context (associated geotags). In such a scenario, however, an incorrect or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated propagation system. Therefore, for reliable geotags propagation, we suggest adopting a user trust model based on social feedback from the users of the photo-sharing system. We compare this socially-driven approach with other user trust models via experiments and subjective testing on an image database of various famous landmarks. Results demonstrate that relying on user feedback is more efficient, since the number of propagated tags more than doubles without loss of accuracy compared to using other models or propagating without trust modeling.},

In order to meet the demands for fast and accurate retrieval of valuable information, we propose a fast and effective content-based document information retrieval system that retrieves the information from the actual content of a document. The proposed method is based on a topic model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is used to extract major keywords for a given document. The main contributions of our system are the increased flexibility, effectiveness, and fast retrieval of information. Our system can easily communicate with existing web service through the standard JSON format. In addition, we increase the speed of information retrieval by using NoSQL based database system with inverted indexing and B-tree based indexing. We validate the performance of our system on real data collected from the SlideShare service. The proposed system shows better retrieval performance over the existing IR system.},

Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

The so-called “digital natives” acquire, as a consequence of their early exposure to these technologies, different patterns of work, distinct attention conducts, new learning preferences and, generally, better skills for learning and working within rich online social contexts. So, it seems reasonable that the traditional education systems evolve, and shape their practice to leverage those new patterns. Though online social networks (OSNs) stand as a powerful tool to extend existing online learning management systems (LMSs) by using them as a gateway to OSNs, LMSs do not exploit fully the advantages of an active social environment for reinforcing the learning experience. We report in this paper the design, development and use of a software platform which enlarges and adapts the basic features of an OSN in order to be useful for very general learning environments. The software allows the creation, assessment and reporting of a range of collaborative activities based on social interactions among the students, and offers a reward mechanism by means of ranking and reputation. We argue that this approach is helpful in increasing the students' motivation, besides improving the learning experience and performance. The software has been tested in an undergraduate course about computer networks. Different tests confirm that the impact on learning success is statistically significant and positive.},

  abstract  = {Automatic annotation of images is of crucial importance in image retrieval and management systems. Most of the existing annotation methods rely on content-based approach to annotation, whose effectiveness is restricted due to the semantic gap between low-level features and semantic annotations, as well as the irrelevance between annotations and image content. Recently, social media analysis has been investigated for image annotation. Inspired by the abundant social diffusion records of images in online social networks, we propose a novel image annotation approach based on social diffusion analysis. We present a common-interest model to interpret social diffusion, i.e. different images have different social diffusion routes due to the preferences of users, and such preferences are represented as common interests of pairwise users rather than personalized interests. We propose an image annotation framework that consists of learning of common interests, feature extraction from social diffusion records, and automatic annotation by learning to rank. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms content-based and user-preference-based annotation methods.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging systems have been largely adopted by users as useful and powerful tools to organize, browse and share interested resources on the web. All the tags used and resources collected by a user constitute the userpsilas personal tag space, which contains valuable information that can be used for building and enhancing the user model. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine user profile from onepsilas personal tag space. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model onepsilas personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We define several properties for each concept generated to evaluate the degree of such concept to depict the userpsilas interest, and then a novel algorithm is introduced to construct a hierarchical user profile from the built lattice. Experiments are carried out on the dataset collected from delicious and a detailed real-life case study is presented. Results show that the hierarchical user profile can describe the target userpsilas interests well enough, as well as organizing and browsing the tags and collocated resources effectively. Several research issues and technical details are discussed to further improve tag-based user profile for personalized services in the end.},

Consequentially, users have trouble finding social media suited to their needs. To help users in ambient environment get relevant media tailored to their interests, we propose a new method which adapts the Katz measure, a path-ensemble based proximity measure, for the use in social tagging services. We model the ternary relations among user, resource and tag as a weighted, undirected tripartite graph. We then apply the Katz measure to this graph, and exploit it to provide personalized recommendation for individual users within ambient intelligence environments.

We conduct the first study that surveys the literature related to social authentication. In this paper, we not only created a taxonomy for classifying all social authentication schemes deployed in online or physical social contexts and extensively analyzed their authentication features, but also built a novel framework for evaluating the effectiveness of all social authentication schemes, identified all the practical and theoretical attacks that may be mounted against such schemes, addressed possible defense strategies, and identified challenges, open questions, and future research opportunities. To measure their accuracy, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, as well as to identify the potential of knowledge-based and trust-based social authentication schemes, a comprehensive comparative assessment of the security, usability, and deployability was conducted. We hope, by providing a solid foundation for gaining sufficient understanding of the manners in which users' social interactions have been utilized in user authentication schemes and their corresponding security implications, we will guide future research in this domain.},

At present, collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used technique in the design of recommender systems to handle information overload. For Web services, however, it is difficult for user to collect personalized QoS (Quality of Service)data and other explicit feedbacks such as ratings. In most cases, only a part of the implicit feedbacks (e.g., watchlist) is available in service registry. In this paper, we leverage implicit feedback from user's watchlist to build a CF-based recommender system for Web service. Our main contribution is to transform implicit feedbacks into explicit ratings to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. More specifically, we first construct binary user-service rating matrix according to the implicit feedback from the watchlist. Then, temporal and tag preference are combined into the original rating matrix to generate a more accurate pseudo rating matrix, which can reflect users' different preference on services in their own watchlists. Finally, we use traditional user-based CF method to produce a personalized service recommendation list with corresponding pseudo ratings. Moreover, the empirical experiments based on ProgrammableWeb show that compared with traditional log-based CF method, the recommender system with temporal and tag preference is more accurate and precise.},

Most existing approaches are performed by training independent concept detectors omitting the interdependencies between concepts. The obtained annotations are often not so satisfactory. Therefore, a process of annotation refinement is mondatory to improve the imprecise annotation results. Recently, harnessing the contextual correlation between concepts is shown to be an important resource to improve concept detection. In this paper, we propose a new context based concept detection process. For this purpose, we define a new semantic measure called Second order Co-occurence Flickr context similarity (SOCFCS), which aggregates the FCS values of common Flickr related-tags of two target concepts in order to calculate their relative semantic context relatedness (SCR). Our proposed measure is applied to build a concept network as the context space. A Random Walk with Restart process is performed over this network to refine the annotation results by exploring the contextual correlation among concepts. Experimental studies are conducted on ImageCLEF 2011 Collection containing 99 concepts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {High-Order Co-Clustering (HOCC) methods have attracted high attention in recent years because of their ability to cluster multiple types of objects simultaneously using all available information. During the clustering process, HOCC methods exploit object co-occurrence information, i.e., inter-type relationships amongst different types of objects as well as object affinity information, i.e., intra-type relationships amongst the same types of objects. However, it is difficult to learn accurate intra-type relationships in the presence of noise and outliers. Existing HOCC methods consider the p nearest neighbours based on Euclidean distance for the intra-type relationships, which leads to incomplete and inaccurate intra-type relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel HOCC method that incorporates multiple subspace learning with a heterogeneous manifold ensemble to learn complete and accurate intra-type relationships. Multiple subspace learning reconstructs the similarity between any pair of objects that belong to the same subspace. The heterogeneous manifold ensemble is created based on two-types of intra-type relationships learnt using p-nearest-neighbour graph and multiple subspaces learning. Moreover, in order to make sure the robustness of clustering process, we introduce a sparse error matrix into matrix decomposition and develop a novel iterative algorithm. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method achieves improved results over the state-of-art HOCC methods for FScore and NMI.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we first offer an overview of advances in the field of distance metric learning. Then, we empirically compare selected methods using a common experimental protocol. The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application. However, existing surveys are either outdated or they focus only on a few methods. As a result, there is an increasing need to summarize the obtained knowledge in a concise, yet informative manner. Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as this task poses significant challenges due to varying conditions during data acquisition. In addition, face verification is a natural application for distance metric learning because the encountered challenge is to define a distance function that: 1) accurately expresses the notion of similarity for verification; 2) is robust to noisy data; 3) generalizes well to unseen subjects; and 4) scales well with the dimensionality and number of training samples. In particular, we utilize well-tested features to assess the performance of selected methods following the experimental protocol of the state-of-the-art database labeled faces in the wild. A summary of the results is presented along with a discussion of the insights obtained and lessons learned by employing the corresponding algorithms.},

Cast differently, classification of user-generated content into generalized categories is the equivalent of automated programs trying to match human adjudged labels. It seems logical to suspect that identification and incorporation of features generally found salient by humans or “focal points”, can allow an automated agent to better match human adjudged labels in classification tasks. In this paper, we leverage this correspondence, by using domain-specific focal points to further inform the classification algorithms of the inherent human biases. We empirically evaluate our method, by classifying YouTube videos using user-annotated tags. Improvements in classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art classification techniques on using our transformed (using focal points) and highly reduced feature space reveals the value of the approach in subjective classification tasks.},

Discovering the correlations among different tags can significantly help predicting precise labels for videos and images. Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty. By casting the video concept detection and image annotation tasks into a sparse multi-label transfer learning framework in this paper, ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, and the multi-label extended sparse discriminant analysis methods are, respectively, well explored and compared.},

LMSs (Learning Management Systems) include such collaborative tools to enable knowledge sharing. Common topology and design constructs of online collaboration are often expressed as forum threads; however, forums or bulletin boards are not primarily designed for social constructivist learning, in which knowledge develops collaboratively in a methodical process that links new items to existing ones. In this paper, we present a preliminary concept and hypothesize that social constructivist learning can be implemented through a semantic network topology of a discussion platform. To that end, we developed Ligilo, a peer-learning, online platform, in which each content item is conveyed as a node in a semantic network constructed of posts. Analysis of this platform consists of three parts. First, we review the theoretical background of networked-structured discussions in learning. Then, we describe the architecture of Ligilo, focusing on two aspects: (1) the learning experience as a process of contributing new information items by relating to existing items and (2) a deep, behavioral analytics framework as a teacher's guide. Both these aspects are based on semantic network topology. We conclude the paper by describing some early cases of peer learning involving networked-structured discussions.},

People spent much time for choosing sentences and thinking what annotations they make on sentences. If people are automatically given sentences recommended to make annotations on, people can make annotations on documents easily with shaving off time. New methods for recommending sentences which can be made annotations on are required. This paper proposes an extraction method of sentences recommended to make annotations on for understanding writer's opinions in a document. The method extracts sentences including writer's opinions by evaluating words included in sentences. If a sentence includes words used for showing writer's opinions, the method extracts the sentence to recommend users to make annotations on. Users of the proposed method can understand writer's opinions deeply by reading a document and making annotations on the extracted sentences. We experimented with the proposed method and verified that the proposed method can extract sentences which are made annotations on by participants for understanding writer's opinions deeply.},

It is possible to construct semantic relationships among tags. To do this, one way of building of relationships among tags is use of a popularized tag as a thing of ontology. However, it is not easy to select the popularized tag from tag cloud and to build a complete ontology with all of tags in the tag-cloud because tags are timely and dynamically updated added with tremendous numbers of tags. Therefore, we construct Primitive Ontologies (POs). A general tag is used to as a thing of a PO. The general tag is matched into one of requested keywords by users. In addition, we propose a methodology to evolve ontology using tags. To construct and evolve a PO, it defines classes and relationships between given tags by a user. Finally, the constructed several POs are integrated into a Tag-Based integrated Semantic ontology (TBiSont) by building relationships between classes that are included in each different PO. The construction of relationships among tags depends on linked resources into tags. The properties of tags are usually characterized by linked resources. It causes to extract semantic relationships among tags, because tags are comprised of meta-information that represents properties of resources. Thereby, the proposed PO is constructed by a general tag as a best-referring tag and relationships among tags including the general tag. The TBiSont as an integration of POs was applied into data analysis and a search process to verify efficiency of as in application systems. When we applied TBiSont into searching, it shows that TBiSont is more efficient than the other statistical-based search systems to increase accuracy or diversity of search results.},

The rich cross-media information carried by the multimodal data in multiple media has a wide audience, deeply reflects the social realities, and brings about much greater social impact than any single media information. Therefore, automatically detecting topics from cross media is of great benefit for the organizations (i.e., advertising agencies and governments) that care about the social opinions. However, cross-media topic detection is challenging from the following aspects: 1) the multimodal data from different media often involve distinct characteristics and 2) topics are presented in an arbitrary manner among the noisy web data. In this paper, we propose a multimodality fusion framework and a topic recovery (TR) approach to effectively detect topics from cross-media data. The multimodality fusion framework flexibly incorporates the heterogeneous multimodal data into a multimodality graph, which takes full advantage from the rich cross-media information to effectively detect topic candidates (T.C.). The TR approach solidly improves the entirety and purity of detected topics by: 1) merging the T.C. that are highly relevant themes of the same real topic and 2) filtering out the less-relevant noise data in the merged T.C. Extensive experiments on both single-media and cross-media data sets demonstrate the promising flexibility and effectiveness of our method in detecting topics from cross media.},

With the growing popularity in Web 2.0 usage, recommending tags is of utmost importance in enabling a user to perform bookmarking easily. An issue that most recommendation systems do not consider is that users have a tendency to choose from tags that are suggested to them, which might bias the true popular rankings of tags. In this paper we consider the problem of tag recommendation for bookmarks based on user feedback. We propose an approach for automatic tag recommendation by using a suggestion set and discuss a randomized suggestion rule for learning the true popular tags. As our algorithm depends on the frequency of tag suggestions, the action of spammers and malicious users may result in skewed ranking of tags for a bookmark. Hence, there arises a need to identify malicious users and spam posts to reinforce the efficiency of our algorithm because spammers can easily mislead a system. We have proposed an approach for classifying spammers based on tagging history of users. Our approach basically estimates the probability of a user being a spammer by analyzing previous posts and tags. Our analysis on a dataset of a popular bookmarking site shows that the proposed method is effective in suggesting the true popular tags and identifying spammers.},

  abstract  = {Making sense of Twitter data streams is challenging due to the extremely high volume of data. One way to address this challenge is to consider these data streams as containing a set of high-level topics. In this research we address the problem of: given a collection of tweets about K high-level topics, how to find topic words that describe these topics as well as how to label each tweet with one of the K topics using a topic modeling approach. Current research has shown that applying topic modeling algorithms directly on tweets does not lead to good results. Hence one approach is to group related tweets together, so as to form a single “pseudo-document”, which is more informative than a single tweet. In this paper we evaluate different grouping schemes found in the literature and propose a new grouping scheme utilizing named entities and word collocations. Results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the existing approaches, to a some extent for all the test cases, and for both finding high-level topics and tweet labeling.},

However, as the social network services always contain large amounts of information on different topics, and people have different influence on different topic, so the group recommendation systems should take the topic identification in large-scale social networks into account to get an appropriate recommendation. In this paper, we proposed a new group recommendation method, which combines topic identification and social networks for group recommendation. In detail, we firstly identify different topical sub-groups by topics in social networks. Secondly, different user factors are used to calculate the user influence (including individual and social) on the topical sub-groups, which can depict the topical sub-group characteristics in different points of view. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the prediction accuracy of the group recommendation.},

However, such support -- and therefore IDEs as awhole -- operate on one revision of the code at a time, and leave handling of code history to external tools or plugins, such asEGit for Eclipse. For example, when a method is removed froma class, developers can no longer find the method through code completion. This forces developers to manually switch across different revisions or resort to using external tools when they need to learn about previous code revisions.We propose a novel approach of adding a temporal dimensionto IDEs, enabling code completion and navigation to operate on multiple revisions of code at a time. We previously introduced the idea of temporal code completion and navigation,and presented a vision for how that idea may be realized.This paper realizes that vision by implementing and evaluatinga prototype tool called Tempura. We describe our algorithmfor processing and indexing historical code information from repositories for Tempura, and demonstrate Tempura's scalability with three large Eclipse projects. We also evaluate Tempura's usability through a controlled user study. The study participantslearned about the code history with more accuracy when usingTempura compared to EGit. Although the sample size was notlarge enough to provide strong statistical significance, the resultsshow a promising outlook for our approach.},

Global labels, i.e., atomic information describing a music title in its entirety, such as its genre, mood, main instruments, or type of vocals, are entered by humans. Classifiers are trained to map audio features to these labels. However, the performances of these classifiers on individual labels are rarely satisfactory. In the case we have to predict several labels simultaneously, we introduce a correction scheme to improve these performances. In this scheme-an instance of the classifier fusion paradigm-an extra layer of classifiers is built to exploit redundancies between labels and correct some of the errors coming from the individual acoustic classifiers. We describe a series of experiments aiming at validating this approach on a large-scale database of music and metadata (about 30 000 titles and 600 labels per title). The experiments show that the approach brings statistically significant improvements.},

The main idea behind tagging is to allow users to provide metadata to the web content from their perspective to facilitate categorization and retrieval. There are many factors that influence users' tag choice. Many studies have been conducted to reveal these factors by analysing tagging data. This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging.},

In this paper, we attempt to exploit a new interaction data, namely print logs, where each record is printing URLs selected by a user using a popular web printing tool. Users usually print web contents based on an intention (subtask or task). Apparently, mining common print tasks from print logs is able to capture users' intentions, which undoubtedly benefits many web applications, such as task oriented recommendation and behavior targeting. However, it is not an easy job to perform this due to the difficulty of URL topic representation and task formulation. To this end, we propose a general framework, named UPT (Users Print Tasks mining framework), for mining print tasks from print logs. Specifically, we attempt to leverage delicious (a social book marking web service) as an external thesaurus to expand the expression of each URL by selecting tags associated with the domain of each URL. Then, we construct a tag co-occurrence graph where similar tags can be clustered as subtasks. If we view each subtask as an item, then the print log is transformed to a transaction database, on which an efficient pattern mining algorithm is proposed to induce tasks. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments on a real print log.},

Both visual information and tags have been investigated in the research field. However, most existing methods use tags and visual characteristics either separately or sequentially in order to estimate the relevance of images. In this paper, we propose an approach that simultaneously utilizes both visual and textual information to estimate the relevance of user tagged images. The relevance estimation is determined with a hypergraph learning approach. In this method, a social image hypergraph is constructed, where vertices represent images and hyperedges represent visual or textual terms. Learning is achieved with use of a set of pseudo-positive images, where the weights of hyperedges are updated throughout the learning process. In this way, the impact of different tags and visual words can be automatically modulated. Comparative results of the experiments conducted on a dataset including 370+images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

However, it can be difficult, even for experienced developers, due to the proliferation of similar technologies, the complex and often implicit dependencies among technologies, and the rapid development in which technology landscape evolves.

  abstract  = {On a crowdsourcing platform consisting of requestersand workers, it is a challenge to recommend suitableworkers for a human intelligence task (HIT) published by a requester. A suitable worker is the one who has a high probability of submitting a correct answer for the published HIT. However, there are four problems that make the existing methods be less effective in recommending suitable workers. First, on most of crowdsourcing platforms, the great majority of workers have good reputations and thus are regarded as homogenous workers who have equal opportunities to be recommended. Secondly, dishonest workers may gain recommendations by counterfeiting good reputations and overstating personal skills. Moreover, the classical data sparsity and cold start problems co-exist in crowdsourcing environments. To effectively differentiate homogenous workers, we firstlycalculate a worker's performance in different types of HITspublished by different requesters. Aiming to improve the accuracy of predicting a worker's performance, we propose a metric which separately considers two requesters' similarities in transacting with the common workers they trust and in transacting with the common workers they distrust. Afterwards, targeting dishonest behaviours, we propose a transaction-based trust model. Targeting the data sparsity problem, we propose a new trust sub-network extraction algorithm (TSE) to discover more requesters who can provide trustworthy opinions for generating recommendations. Furthermore, we propose two strategiesfor solving the cold start problem. Finally, by incorporatingthe similarity metric, the new trust model, the new trustsub-network extraction algorithm and the new strategies, wepropose a novel trust-aware worker recommendation methodCrowdRec. The experimental results illustrate that CrowdRecsignificantly outperforms CF and three state-of-the-art trustbased recommendation methods both in terms of accuracy and coverage.},

  abstract  = {What we know is less important than our capacity to continue to learn more until e-learning appeared. While e-learning technology has matured considerably since its inception, there are still many problems that practitioners find when come to implementing e-learning. Today's knowledge society of the 21st century requires a flexible learning environment which is capable to adapt according to teaching and learning objectives, students' profiles and preferences for information and communication technologies and services. Advances in technology offer new opportunities in enhancing teaching and learning. Many advances in learning technologies are taking place throughout the world. The new technologies enable individuals to personalize the environment in which they work or learn, utilizing a range of tools to meet their interests and needs. Research community has believed that an e-learning ecosystem is the next generation e-learning but has faced challenges in optimizing resource allocations, dealing with dynamic demands on getting information and knowledge anywhere and anytime, handling rapid storage growth requirements, cost controlling and greater flexibility. Additionally, e-learning ecosystems need to improve its infrastructure, which can devote the required computation and storage resources for e-learning ecosystems. So, we need flourish, growing, up-to-date and strong infrastructure e-learning ecosystems in a productive and cost-effective way to be able to face rapidly-changing environments. In this paper, an e-learning ecosystem (ELES) which supports modern technologies is introduced and implemented. An integration between cloud computing and Web 2.0 technologies and services will be used to support the development of e-learning ecosystems; cloud computing as an adoptable technology for many of the organizations with its dynamic scalability and usage of virtualized resources as a service through the Internet. Web 2.0 brings new instruments help building dynamic- - e-learning ecosystem on the web.},

  abstract  = {We study what we call semi-defined classification, which deals with the categorization tasks where the taxonomy of the data is not well defined in advance. It is motivated by the real-world applications, where the unlabeled data may also come from some other unknown classes besides the known classes for the labeled data. Given the unlabeled data, our goal is to not only identify the instances belonging to the known classes, but also cluster the remaining data into other meaningful groups. It differs from traditional semi-supervised clustering in the sense that in semi-supervised clustering the supervision knowledge is too far from being representative of a target classification, while in semi-defined classification the labeled data may be enough to supervise the learning on the known classes. In this paper we propose the model of Double-latent-layered LDA (D-LDA for short) for this problem. Compared with LDA with only one latent variable y for word topics, D-LDA contains another latent variable z for (known and unknown) document classes. With this double latent layers consisting of y and z and the dependency between them, D-LDA directly injects the class labels into z to supervise the exploiting of word topics in y. Thus, the semi-supervised learning in D-LDA does not need the generation of pair wise constraints, which is required in most of the previous semi-supervised clustering approaches. We present the experimental results on ten different data sets for semi-defined classification. Our results are either comparable to (on one data sets), or significantly better (on the other nine data set) than the six compared methods, including the state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering methods.},

It can be hypothesized that the public interactions of political players may be treated differently in the media based on the editorial perspective of the media sources in question and the positions that the political players occupy in the political arena. However, the question arises, how can these differences be measured? Using corpus extraction techniques, SPARQL queries, and ontology engineering, this study compares the positions that key political players occupy in discourse spaces that are modeled by two ideologically distant news media sources based on the same controversial public issue.},

For massive graphs, subgraph queries may have enormous number of matches, and so it is inefficient to compute all matches when only top-k matches are desired. Meanwhile, parallel algorithm is urgent for the scalability of massive graph computing. In this paper, we address the challenges of top-k subgraph query in massive graph. Firstly, we present a new graph matching notion: “approximate graph simulation”. With approximate graph simulation, top-k subgraph query can be customized by appointing a weighted query graph, which provides good flexibility for different application scenarios. Secondly, we propose a parallel top-k subgraph query algorithm at the level of vertex. With such algorithm, each vertex in massive graph obtains its matching state separately without requiring global graph information. In the algorithm, we also design a filter mechanism to speed up the the computation and a aggregation mechanism to obtain top-k vertices for query focus. Using real-life datasets, we experimentally verify that our approach of parallel top-k subgraph query are efficient.},

Based on this data set, we first checked the overlap of user-created tags and author-provided metadata with the title and content of the annotated web pages. Then, we experimented on two clustering methods based on tags and author-provided metadata. The results show that both tags and author-provided metadata add valuable information to existing page content and that social tags are more effective than author-created metadata for enhancing web clustering performance either as an independent information source or as links connecting topically related pages.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of social image understanding, i.e., tag refinement, tag assignment, and image retrieval. Different from previous work, we propose a novel weakly supervised deep matrix factorization algorithm, which uncovers the latent image representations and tag representations embedded in the latent subspace by collaboratively exploring the weakly supervised tagging information, the visual structure, and the semantic structure. Due to the well-known semantic gap, the hidden representations of images are learned by a hierarchical model, which are progressively transformed from the visual feature space. It can naturally embed new images into the subspace using the learned deep architecture. The semantic and visual structures are jointly incorporated to learn a semantic subspace without overfitting the noisy, incomplete, or subjective tags. Besides, to remove the noisy or redundant visual features, a sparse model is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep architecture. Finally, a unified optimization problem with a well-defined objective function is developed to formulate the proposed problem and solved by a gradient descent procedure with curvilinear search. Extensive experiments on real-world social image databases are conducted on the tasks of image understanding: image tag refinement, assignment, and retrieval. Encouraging results are achieved with comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The content is typically user-generated and includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. A particularly intriguing type of content is user-generated annotations (tags) for content items, as these concise string descriptions allow for reasonings about the interests of the user who created the content, but also about the user who generated the annotations. This paper presents a framework to cast the different entities of such networks into a unified graph model representing the mutual relationships of users, content, and tags. It derives scoring functions for each of the entities and relations. We have performed an experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets (crawled from deli.cio.us and Flickr) where manual user assessments of the query result quality show that our unified graph framework delivers high-quality results on social networks.},

Each video item is represented as a collection of weighted attributes that represent the accompanying features. The proposed solution allows users to construct a sequence of video items by imposing global and transitional constraints. Transitional constraints deal with the similarity between successive video objects while global constraints ensure that the retrieved video attributes attain the proposed user profile. The retrieved sequence of videos is constructed by considering it as a solution to a constrained sequence retrieval problem where constraints represent user preferences. The constrained retrieval problem is then modeled as a network flow model which leads to integer program. Relaxation techniques are then used for complexity reduction. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model in constructing the playlist according to user needs.},

A Recommender System attempts to solve the problem of information overload and provides product and service recommendation based on user profile and preferences. The location of the user is an important information item that can be associated to the existing user profile in order to provide efficient recommendations. Also, easy availability of GPS enabled devices brings a large amount of GPS trajectories representing user's mobile logs. These GPS trajectories can be used to mine interesting patterns about users. We have studied the utility and application of information extracted from user's GPS trajectory data in recommender systems. We conceive that recommendation has an intrinsic social component and therefore this work takes a perspective towards the social aspect in location based recommender systems.

Providing justification to a recommendation gives credibility to a recommender system. Some recommender systems (Amazon.com, etc.) try to explain their recommendations, in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. However, their explanations are not sufficient, because they are based solely on rating or navigational data, ignoring the content data. Several systems have proposed the combination of content data with rating data to provide more accurate recommendations, but they cannot provide qualitative justifications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that attains both accurate and justifiable recommendations. We construct a feature profile for the users to reveal their favorite features. Moreover, we group users into biclusters (i.e., groups of users which exhibit highly correlated ratings on groups of items) to exploit partial matching between the preferences of the target user and each group of users. We have evaluated the quality of our justifications with an objective metric in two real data sets (Reuters and MovieLens), showing the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.},

However, source code documentation is an important task, especially when dealing with groups of developers. An updated documentation allows group members to have greater visibility on what has been and is being developed, allowing the reuse of source code. This research aims at designing, developing and validating a semi-automatic documentation method for source code from the existing design documentation on a particular project being developed by a small team, as well as updating this documentation from information gathered from the source code under development.

These challenges stem from the fact that software development is a group activity that involves different situations, goals, methodologies and needs of the software development organization. A projectpsilas documentation processes should be flexible to suit the needs and goals of an organization and allow multiple approaches. We propose three approaches for capturing design decisions to increase the knowledge retention and decision capture rates in an organization: 1) formal elicitation; 2) lightweight top-down capture; and 3) lightweight bottom-up capture. Customizable capturing methods are suggested to implement the approaches and a tool is created for each approach.

Accessing the information from these real Web databases has become increasingly important for the users to find the desired information. Web users search for the desired information by querying these Web databases, when the number of query results generated is large, it is very difficult for the Web user to select the most relevant information from the large result set generated. Users today, have become more and more demanding in terms of the quality of information that is provided to them while searching the Web databases. The most common solution to solve the problem involves ranking the query results returned by the Web databases. Earlier approaches have used query logs, user profiles and frequencies of database values. The problem in all of these techniques is that ranking is performed in a user and query independent manner. This paper, proposes an automated ranking of query results returned by Web databases by analyzing user, query and workload similarity. The effectiveness of this approach is discussed considering a vehicle Web database as an example.},

The paper first defines the spectrum of Knowledge Organization Systems, from unstructured with less semantics to highly structured with richer semantics. It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories. We summarize the prominent issues with the current research and highlight future directions on learning constantly evolving knowledge from social media data.},

  abstract  = {With the development of social media technology, users often register accounts, post messages and create friend links on several different platforms. Performing user identity mapping on multi-platform based on the behavior patterns of users is considerable for network supervision and personalization service. The existing methods focus on utilizing either text information or structure information alone. However, text information and structure information reflect different aspects of a user. An organic combination of them is beneficial to mining user behavior patterns, thus help identify users across platforms accurately. The challenging problems are the effective representation and similarity computation of the text and structure information. We propose a mapping method which integrates text and structure information. At first, the model represents user name, description, location information based on word2vec or string matching, and friend information represented as relation network is regarded as structure information. Then these information are used for similarity computation using Jaccard index or cosine similarity. After similarity computation, a linear model is adopted to get the overall similarity of user pairs to perform user mapping. Based on the proposed method, we develop a prototype system, which allows users to set and adjust the weights of different information, or set expected index. The experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model.},

In that model, a partially annotated collection with a lot of non-labeled music was annotated at a high precision and recall. In this paper, we proposed a new model -- label probability prediction model -- and introduce it into the Sordo's work, which makes a combined model, to improve the accuracy of propagation without exploiting any other information. In addition, we also made some modifications to the original Sordo's model that could make the algorithm works better. Then we compare the result of combined model to that yielded by the original on a publicly accessible ground truth data, and find that, the new approach can reach a higher recall. Furthermore, with the same recall, our method obtains a better precision.},

Rooting from the machine learning, recommender systems are in the center of the knowledge engineering that are used frequently in many computer science related fields. Therefore, this paper tries to utilize time information inferred from users' ages, which is going to be employed in the recommender systems during the similarity calculation between users. Adding more parameters, in other words, inserting detailed information of the users' preferences into the calculations will stimulate the resolution of fulfilling results thanks to new criterion. Specifically, it is proposed a conversion between two particular dates which are relevant to the user's personal data. 10-year interval is considered as a transition between generations, thus generation gap between users can make sense positively or negatively in terms of the amount of gap. Additionally, for the prerequisite of being a peer, it is defined a 3-year long difference can be a boundary to say that two users can be in the same wavelength. From the inspiration of this idea, a new mathematical addition into the well-known similarity calculation is presented in this paper. Eventually, this further time detail is taken into account via inverse proportion in similarity calculation and time incorporation approach for recommender system is emphasized. All in all, proposed method is to be tested with a real valued Movie Lens-MLP dataset on the platform of MatLab.},

Especially with increasing popularity of the User Created Contents (UCC) and handheld mobile devices, there are requirements for supporting active media streaming services with smart phones based on the personalized SNS services.

In this paper, a new fast exemplar-based clustering approach is proposed for a dataset with an arbitrary shape and number of clusters. The proposed approach begins with the reduced set of a dataset, which is a condensation of the dataset obtained by the well-developed kernel density estimators reduced set density estimator or fast reduced set density estimator, and then enters into its two advantageous stages: 1) fast exemplar finding (FEF) and 2) fast cluster assignment. The idea of the proposed approach has its basis in three assumptions: 1) exemplars should come from high-density samples; 2) exemplars should be either the components of the reduced set or their neighbors with high similarities; and 3) clusters can be diffused by surrounding both exemplars and its labeled reduced set. We theoretically analyze the proposed FEF from the perspective of the generalization performance of clustering and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on several benchmarking datasets.},

In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the image tags is proposed. Firstly, information entropy of the tag is defined to refine tag frequency to predict tag initial relevance. Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {A novel method to obtain hierarchical and overlapping clusters from network data – i.e., a set of nodes endowed with pairwise dissimilarities – is presented. The introduced method is hierarchical in the sense that it outputs a nested collection of groupings of the node set depending on the resolution or degree of similarity desired, and it is overlapping since it allows nodes to belong to more than one group. Our construction is rooted on the facts that a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering of a network can be equivalently represented by a finite ultrametric space and that a convex combination of ultrametrics results in a cut metric. By applying a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering method to multiple dithered versions of a given network and then convexly combining the resulting ultrametrics, we obtain a cut metric associated to the network of interest. We then show how to extract a hierarchical overlapping clustering structure from the aforementioned cut metric. Furthermore, the so-called overlapping function is presented as a tool for gaining insights about the data by identifying meaningful resolutions of the obtained hierarchical structure. Additionally, we explore hierarchical overlapping quasi-clustering methods that preserve the asymmetry of the data contained in directed networks. Finally, the presented method is illustrated via synthetic and real-world classification problems including handwritten digit classification and authorship attribution of famous plays.},

People can add Web pages to such sites as bookmarks and allow themselves as well as others to manipulate them. One of the key features of the social book marking sites is the ability of annotating a Web page when it is being bookmarked. The annotation usually contains a set of words or phrases, which are collectively known as tags, that could reveal the semantics of the annotated Web page. Efficient and effective search of Web pages can then be achieved via such tags. However, spam tags that are irrelevant to the content of Web pages often appear to deceive other users for malicious or commercial purposes. Various techniques have been devised to tackle such tag spam detection problem. Most of these techniques were able to detect a user that always annotate spam tags. However, finer levels of detection are seldom discussed. In this work, we will propose a method based on a text mining approach to discover the relations between Web pages and there tag posts. These relations are then used to compute the similarity between a Web page and its tag post to decide if it is a spam post. Preliminary experiments show that the accuracy of the post-level spam detection task is 83%.},

Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},

Good representations are an important requirement for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks to be performed successfully. However, a major problem with neural networks is that training time becomes prohibitive for very large datasets and the learning algorithm can get stuck in local minima for very deep and wide network architectures. In this paper we examine 3 ways to improve feature learning for audio data using neural networks: 1.using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) instead of standard sigmoid units; 2.using a powerful regularisation technique called Dropout; 3.using Hessian-Free (HF) optimisation to improve training of sigmoid nets. We show that these methods provide significant improvements in training time and the features learnt are better than state of the art handcrafted features, with a genre classification accuracy of 83 ± 1.1% on the Tzanetakis (GTZAN) dataset. We found that the rectifier networks learnt better features than the sigmoid networks. We also demonstrate the capacity of the features to capture relevant information from audio data by applying them to genre classification on the ISMIR 2004 dataset.},

  abstract  = {Music genre classification is a challenging task in the field of music information retrieval. Existing approaches usually attempt to extract features only from acoustic aspect. However, spectrogram also provides useful information because it describes the temporal change of energy distribution over frequency bins. In this paper, we propose the use of Gabor filters to generate effective visual features that can capture the characteristics of a spectrogram's texture patterns. On the other hand, acoustic features are extracted using universal background model and maximum a posteriori adaptation. Based on these two types of features, we then employ SVM to perform the final classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that combining visual and acoustic features can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy on two widely used datasets.},

The experiments are done on three folksonomy datasets: Delicious, Flickr and Bibsonomy. Important results for three popular tag recommendation algorithms: PITF, FolkRank and Adapted PageRank are reported in terms of prediction quality. It is found that users' history usage preferences change across all data sets; hence overall prediction quality of personalized recommendation system may suffer. We discover a generic life cycle of folksonomy users on the basis of their history usage. We propose this life cycle can be used to improve an overall prediction performance of a recommendation system across all folksonomies.},

  abstract = {With an increasing number of images that are available in social media, image annotation has emerged as an important research topic due to its application in image matching and retrieval. Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

  abstract  = {Software developers can search, share and learn development experience, solutions, bug fixes and open source projects in software information sites such as StackOverflow and Freecode. Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

The common practice is to have each platform captures and maintains data related to its own users. Later the data is analyzed to produce user specific recommendations. We argue that recommendations could be enriched by considering data consolidated from multiple sources instead of limiting the analysis to data captured from a single source. Integrating data from multiple sources is analogous to watching the behavior and preferences of each user on multiple platforms instead of a limited one platform based vision. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which utilizes user specific data collected from multiple platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to make recommendations by consulting multiple social networks to produce a rich modeling of user behavior. For this purpose, we collected and anonymized a specific dataset that contains information from BlogCatalog, Twitter and Flickr web-sites. We implemented several different types of recommendation methodologies to observe their performances while using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources. The conducted experiments showed that using multiple features from multiple social networks produces a wider perspective of user behavior and preferences leading to improved recommendation outcome.},

In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

  abstract  = {Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common items which are tagged either manually or in a semiautomatic manner. However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).},

But, the performance degrades with increase in the number of unknown words. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome this performance degradation using fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rule based model is designed to provide TnT with sufficient information about the tag of unknown words without degrading the performance of TnT. When TnT with fuzzy rule based learning encounters an unknown word, the TnT generates a set of possible tags for the given word, based on the fuzzy rules matched by the word. If the word does not match any fuzzy rule, then the model depends upon the probability distribution of the suffix. This approach guarantees that the performance of TnT will only be improved from its normal performance.},

They can be described by both content and social related attributes, called social image attributes, including visual contents, users, tags, and timestamps. There are strong coupling relationships between social image attributes, which make social images not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). By analyzing the relationships among these attributes, we can better understand the semantic activities conducted on such non-IID social images, hence enabling new applications including content organization, recommendation, and social activity understanding. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to analyze the coupling relationships between social images, which involves not only intra-coupled similarity within a social image attribute, but also inter-coupled similarity between attributes, in analyzing the non-IIDness of the similarity between social images. In particular, we propose a multi-entry version of the coupled similarity metric to deal with attributes (i.e., tags) which have a many-to-one relationship with respect to images. Experimental results on a Flickr group dataset show that the proposed algorithm captures coupling relationships and therefore achieves promising results in various applications, including image clustering and tagging.},

This model is based on a statistical method called Association Rules (AR) using an Apriori algorithm to generate the recommendations.},

The potential of very subtle yet important emergent semantics hidden in such environments calls for equally elegant and powerful methods to "mine" them. However, much of the previous work on model based recommender systems for folksonomies considered user to resource and resource to tag similarity separately, ignoring the dependency of users' interest to both the tags and the corresponding resources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic personalized recommendation model, Latent Interest Model, that accounts for users, tags and resources jointly. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on real data sets obtained from a popular online bookmarking site using different performance measures for tag and resource recommendation tasks. Our experimental results show that our model captures personal preferences for tag usage and resource selection. Performance evaluation of Latent Interest Model indicates that the proposed personalized method yields significant improvement of recommendation accuracy.},

Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy. The experimental results on a real-world dataset, Citeulike, indicate significant improvements in recommendation quality and better performance compared with the existing systems.},

  abstract = {Audio tags correspond to keywords that people use to describe different aspects of a music clip. With the explosive growth of digital music available on the Web, automatic audio tagging, which can be used to annotate unknown music or retrieve desirable music, is becoming increasingly important. This can be achieved by training a binary classifier for each tag based on the labeled music data. Our method that won the MIREX 2009 audio tagging competition is one of this kind of methods. However, since social tags are usually assigned by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation information is useful for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem and propose two solutions to solve it. The experimental results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

In write-through policy, write is done synchronously both to cache and main memory. But, write-through policy causes large energy overhead due to frequent lower lever cache accesses during write operations. A new cache architecture called Tag-Bloom cache is proposed in order to reduce the power consumption. Here, a tag is attached to each way in the L2 cache. This way tag is stored in way-tag array in L1 cache. Utilizing these tags, L2 cache can be accessed as a direct mapping cache during subsequent write hits, thereby power consumption is reduced. A Bloom Filter is introduced to accurately predict the cache miss and hot/cold checks. A considerable energy saving is obtained based on SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks along with a small area overhead and no performance degradation. High-performance microprocessors now-a-days use longer addresses and hence cache tag arrays become longer. This concept of Tag-Bloom can be applied to other existing cache design techniques to achieve further power reduction.},

In the retrieval systems, text description/tags play a key role to bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and higher-level concepts, and so guarantee the reliable search. However, in practice manual tags are usually noisy and incomplete, resulting in a limited performance of image retrieval. To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic topic model to formalize the correlation of tags with visual features via the latent semantic topics. Our proposed approach allows us to effectively annotate and refine tags based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm for approximate inference.

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a “query and ranking” manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.},

We introduce in this paper a novel image retrieval framework based on a new class of kernels referred to as “network-dependent”. The main contribution of our method includes (i) a variational framework which helps designing a kernel using both the intrinsic image features and the underlying contextual informations resulting from different (e.g. social) links and (ii) the proof of convergence of the kernel to a fixed-point, that is positive definite and thus associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Experiments conducted on different ground truths, including the ImageClef/Flickr set, show the outperformance and the substantial gain of our ranking kernel with respect to the use of classic “network-free” kernels.},

We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively.

With such mappings, the factors of a MF model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy. We use the mapping concept to construct an attribute-aware matrix factorization model for item recommendation from implicit, positive-only feedback.

On the social media, images usually have an incomplete or noisy set of social tags provided by the mobile users, and we consider this issue as defective tag assignments. Previous studies on social image tagging have mostly focused on multi-label classification without considering the defective tags. In these studies, the usage of multi-label classification techniques is expected to synergically exploit the linear relations between the image features and the semantic tags. However, these approaches usually aimed to capture the linear relations from the training data while ignoring the helpful information from the test data. In addition, they failed to incorporate the non-linear associations residing in the visual features as well as in the semantic tags. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel approach based on non-linear matrix completion for image tagging task with defective tags. Specifically, we first construct the entire feature-tag matrix based on the visual features with non-linear kernel mapping. Then, we present a formal methodology together with an optimization method under the matrix completion framework to jointly complete the tags of training and test images. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method shows promising results on image tagging task on two benchmark social image datasets with defective tags, and establishes a baseline for such models in this research domain.},

  abstract  = {Being able to predict whether a song can be a hit has important applications in the music industry. Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

In this paper, we show that this problem can be formalized as an instance of learning in a latent structured prediction framework, where the graphical model encodes the presence and absence of a class as well as the assignments of semantic labels to superpixels. As a consequence, we are able to leverage standard algorithms with good theoretical properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using the challenging SIFT-flow dataset and show average per-class accuracy improvements of 7% over the state-of-the-art.},

The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes. Our contribution is to demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive method for generating sub-class representations has the ability to improve classification results in the case of tag classes that are visually highly heterogenous. The approach is evaluated on a set of 1 million photos with 10 top-level classes, from the dataset released by the ACM Multimedia 2013 Yahoo!

Experiments show that the proposed system delivers sound performance for visually diverse classes compared with methods that directly model top classes.},

The features in frame-based feature vector sequence format are further represented by their mean and standard deviation such that they can be combined with other segment-based features to form a fixed-dimensional feature vector for a segment. We train an ensemble classifier, which consists of SVM and AdaBoost classifiers, for each tag. For the audio annotation task, the individual classifier outputs are transformed into calibrated probability scores such that probability ensemble can be employed. For the audio retrieval task, we propose using ranking ensemble.

Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

The second classifier maps actively corrupted tags to the true tags, reducing incorrect mappings caused by low-level acoustic variations in the first classifier, and to augment the tags with additional relevant tags. Training the classifiers is implemented using marginal co-regularization, pair of which draws the two classifiers into agreement by a joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on two sound datasets, Freefield1010 and Task4 of DCASE2016.

By integrating a real-time music tagger, the PWT player can display dynamic tag distributions via a set of tag bars that move in sync with the music.

We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played.

  abstract  = {Bloom Filters are a technique to reduce the effects of conflicts/interference in hash table-like structures. Conventional hash tables store information in a single location which is susceptible to destructive interference through hash conflicts. A Bloom Filter uses multiple hash functions to store information in several locations, and recombines the information through some voting mechanism. Many microarchitectural predictors use simple single-index hash tables to make binary 0/1 predictions, and Bloom Filters help improve predictor accuracy. However, implementing a true Bloom Filter requires k hash functions, which in turn implies a k-ported hash table, or k sequential accesses. Unfortunately,the area of a hardware table increases quadratically with the port count, increasing costs of area, latency and power consumption. We propose a simple but elegant modification to the Bloom Filter algorithm that uses banking combined with special hash functions that guarantee all hash indexes fall into non-conflicting banks. We evaluate several applications of our Banked Bloom Filter (BBF) prediction in processors: BBF branch prediction, BBF load hit/miss prediction, and BBF last-tag prediction. We show that BBF predictors can provide accurate predictions with substantially less cost than previous techniques.},

This sheds lights onto a wide variety of potential applications related to action recognition. The accurate estimation of human poses from the depth image is universally a critical step. However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when facing severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within a specific human action domain. Furthermore, as an extension, we learn a conditional model by incorporation of pose tags to further increase the accuracy of pose correction. In the experiments, significant improvements on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction are observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system. Our experiments for the facial landmark correction also illustrate that our algorithm can improve the accuracy of other detection/estimation systems.},

To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation.

  abstract = {A novel framework for music genre classification, namely the joint sparse low-rank representation (JSLRR) is proposed in order to: 1) smooth the noise in the test samples, and 2) identify the subspaces that the test samples lie onto. An efficient algorithm is proposed for obtaining the JSLRR and a novel classifier is developed, which is referred to as the JSLRR-based classifier. Special cases of the JSLRR-based classifier are the joint sparse representation-based classifier and the low-rank representation-based one. The performance of the three aforementioned classifiers is compared against that of the sparse representation-based classifier, the nearest subspace classifier, the support vector machines, and the nearest neighbor classifier for music genre classification on six manually annotated benchmark datasets. The best classification results reported here are comparable with or slightly superior than those obtained by the state-of-the-art music genre classification methods.},

The optimal goal of recent research is to automatically annotate images and overcome the semantic gap between the image content and the associated text representation. Image retrieval from large databases is one of the important domains that can benefit from automatic tagging. The automatic tagging task is currently associated with many challenges ranging from inaccuracy of retrieval technique to the efficiency and speed of the tagging approaches. In this paper we propose a statistical based tagging approach that uses normalized multidimensional color histograms as a global descriptor of low level features of images. Our results demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform the Learning based methods in terms of accuracy and speed.},

  abstract = {While a listener may derive semantic associations for audio clips from direct auditory cues (e.g., hearing “bass guitar”) as well as from “context” (e.g., inferring “bass guitar” in the context of a “rock” song), most state-of-the-art systems for automatic music annotation ignore this context. Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the number of digital images has increased so that the management of this volume of data needs an efficient system for browsing, categorising and searching. Automatic image annotation is designed for assigning tags to images for more accurate retrieval. Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image annotation applications.},

Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.},

In addition, we leverage features extracted from both online and offline communities to recommend ongoing events to attendees with different needs. Compared with the baseline method, people preferred public activities suggested by our heuristic rule-based method. Using a dataset collected from 45 participants, we found that the context-based approach for private group formation can attain a precision and recall of over 80%, and the usage of spatial-temporal contexts and group computing can have more than a 30% performance improvement over considering the interaction frequency between a user and related groups. A case study revealed that, by extracting the features such as dynamic intimacy and static intimacy, our cross-community approach for ongoing event recommendation can meet different user needs.},

For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) “viralets”, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including users’ comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.). 1

Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.

  abstract  = {KNN-based image annotation method is proved to be very successful. However, it suffers from two issues: (1) high computational cost; (2) the difficulty of finding semantically similar images. In this paper, we propose a graph-based dimensionality reduction method to solve the two problems by adapting the locality sensitive discriminant analysis method [1] to multi-label setting. We first determine relevant and irrelevant images based on label information and construct relevant and irrelevant graphs by focusing on the visually similar relevant and irrelevant images. A linear feature transformation matrix is derived by considering the two graphs. The transformation can map the images to a low-dimensional subspace in which neighborhood relevant images are pulled closer while irrelevant images are pushed away. Thus the new feature after dimensionality reduction is quite fit for KNN-based image annotation. Experiments on the Corel dataset also demonstrate the effectiveness of our dimensionality reduction method for KNN-based image annotation.},

By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes the image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Then we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. Moreover, we extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) which captures the nonlinearity of features, and further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sport and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.},

  abstract  = {Music auto-tagging refers to automatically assigning semantic labels (tags) such as genre, mood and instrument to music so as to facilitate text-based music retrieval. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {Pointwise label and pairwise label are both widely used in computer vision tasks. For example, supervised image classification and annotation approaches use pointwise label, while attribute-based image relative learning often adopts pairwise labels. These two types of labels are often considered independently and most existing efforts utilize them separately. However, pointwise labels in image classification and tag annotation are inherently related to the pairwise labels. For example, an image labeled with "coast" and annotated with "beach, sea, sand, sky" is more likely to have a higher ranking score in terms of the attribute "open", while "men shoes" ranked highly on the attribute "formal" are likely to be annotated with "leather, lace up" than "buckle, fabric". The existence of potential relations between pointwise labels and pairwise labels motivates us to fuse them together for jointly addressing related vision tasks. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between class labels, tags and attributes, and propose a novel framework PPP(Pointwise and Pairwise image label Prediction), which is based on overlapped group structure extracted from the pointwise-pairwise-label bipartite graph. With experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance on three vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

The PARAFAC2 is employed to effectively harness the multi-label information for dimensionality reduction. Any vectorized test auditory representation of temporal modulations is first projected onto the semantic space derived via the PARAFAC2 and the coefficient vector is obtained. Then, the annotation vector is obtained by multiplying this coefficient vector by the left singular vectors of the second slice (i.e., the slice associated to the label vector).

  abstract  = {In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

Given a set of training music recordings represented by the tag-music recording matrix having zero-one (indicator) vectors of the tags associated with each recording in its columns along with the matrix of the ATM representations in its columns, a low-rank weight matrix is sought, such that the tag-music recording matrix is expressed as the product of the weight matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations plus an error matrix. Clearly, such a weight matrix captures the relationships between the labels (i.e., tags) and the audio features. It can be derived by solving a convex nuclear norm minimization problem, if the tag-music recording matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations are assumed to be jointly low-rank. Having found the weight matrix, the annotation vector for labeling any test music recording can be obtained by multiplying the weight matrix with its ATM representation. The just outlined method is referred to as low-rank representation based multi-label annotation (LRRMA).

  abstract = {We present a multi-layer group sparse coding framework for concurrent single-label image classification and annotation. By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Therefore we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. To make our model more suitable for nonlinear separable features, we also extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Moreover, we also integrate our multi-layer group sparse coding with kNN strategy, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sports and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.},

Indeed, during the ground-truth annotation process, several annotators may express doubts, or disagree with each other. In this paper, we propose to fuse annotators' decisions in a way to keep information about this uncertainty. This fusion provides us continuous scores, that are used for training a regressive boosting algorithm.

Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes.

  abstract  = {The availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. This paper discusses about an approach for automatic annotation in digital images. Some of the previous models for automatic image annotations are translation model (TM), continuous-space relevance model (CRM) and multiple Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM).These models have some semantic gap problems. To avoid these problems here developed a hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which is used to combine both low-level image features and user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based on the low-level image features. Low-level features are color, texture and shape. For images with user provided tags, HPM use both the image features and the tags to recommend additional tags to label the images. Here a Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) is used to capture both color and texture information. An L1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The kernel density estimation is accelerated by an Improved Fast Gauss transform(IFGT).When the number of images becomes larger then Tag-Image Association Matrix (TIAM) used in the HPM framework become very sparse, thus it is very difficult to estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. So a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for tackling this data sparsity issue. Here a CF algorithm is used to find the correlation between the words. Building such a HPM will make image labelling more efficient and less labour intensive.},

Typically, data-dependent branches are associated with program data structures, and follow store-load-branch execution sequence. A set of memory locations is written at an earlier point in a program. Later, these locations are read, and used for evaluating branch condition. Branch outcome depends on data values stored in data structure, which, typically do not have repeatable pattern. Therefore, in addition to history-based dynamic predictor, we need a different kind of predictor for handling such branches. This paper presents Store-Load-Branch (SLB) predictor; a compiler-assisted dynamic branch prediction scheme for data-dependent direct and indirect branches. For every data-dependent branch, compiler identifies store instructions that modify the data structure associated with the branch. Marked store instructions are dynamically tracked, and stored values are used for computing branch flags ahead of time. Branch flags are buffered, and later used for making predictions. On average, compared to standalone TAGE predictor, combined TAGE+SLB predictor reduces branch MPKI by 21% and 51% for SPECINT and EEMBC benchmark suites respectively.},

Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts.

Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

This approach focuses on previous indicate preferences which is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and hacking. For solving the problem of hacking and improving the accuracy, trust-based CF methods have been proposed previously. These methods focused on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, most existing approaches use trust as a factor independent from time which we think that trust value between users is dynamic; hence it change over time. For this reason, we used friendship time and proposed a novel temporal-trust based approach called AgeTrust to measure trust value. To validate the proposed approach, we used Delicious data set and compared our approach with two other traditional trust-based approaches: traditional CF and FriendshipTrust. Result shows that our proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches.},

Using 15 benchmarks from the PARSEC and SPLASH-2 suites we show that our scheme significantly reduces communication latency in NUMA systems and achieves an average of 9% performance improvement, with at most 3% on-chip storage overhead.},

To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions.

Overall, in 80% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity. Experiments are conducted on different datasets and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

From the reports of previous studies, tag-based recommendation and assessment has been recognized as being an effective approach that can assist learners in finding out the clues and concepts of articles, such that it enables learners to be familiar with the learning content. However, sparse noisy data influences the quality of recommendations, especially for tag choices that are not mapped to the features of both the users and content. To cope with these problems, we adopt a hybrid recommendation method to consider tag preference, tag relevance and social networking. The experimental results show that the approach benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge, and can be an effective and efficient mechanism for enhancing the quality of prior knowledge recommendation.},

TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets.

However, obtaining the proper relationship among user, resource and tag is still a challenge in social annotation based recommendation researches.

With the help of such relationship, we can obtain the Topic-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and resources, and Interest-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and users.

The main goal of tweets classification and linking is to integrate all tweets that are related semantically in one place on the Web. The data inequality problems exist because authors post tweets and hashtag them based on their own preference. The authors can post tweets in different languages (English-Arabic). Therefore, the hashtags cannot be the only trackback function of the tweet to link it with the related tweets. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop an automated tweet classifier which is not limited by the language or the category of the tweet. The approach can create new suggested multilingual (English, Arabic) hashtags from tweet's content and comments "auto-tagging" in social linked open data (LOD), matching the tweets in the same topic and provides high accuracy and performance using blocking and indexing techniques.

Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

  abstract  = {Web 2.0 technologies have brought new ways of connecting people in social networks for collaboration in various on-line communities. Social Computing is a novel and emerging computing paradigm that involves a multi-disciplinary approach in analyzing and modeling social behaviors on different media and platforms to produce intelligent and interactive applications and results. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results. Lastly, we present a small subset of an extensive reference list, which contains over 140 highly relevant references relating to the recent development in the computational aspects of Social Computing.},

Our model first extracts keywords from text through a multi-weighting framework, which includes frequency weighting, sentence weighting, speaker weighting and position weighting. Then we get their bigrams through frequent pattern matching. In order to generate more flexible and socialized tags, we expand keywords and their bigrams by exploring tag associations mined from a famous bookmarking web del.icio.us. Finally we rank the three parts of tag candidates under a uniform metric. Unlike previous models used for tag recommendation task, our model needs neither seed tags for source texts nor a complete tag set. It can recommend new tags out of the historical tag set. We evaluate our methods on 10,265 Chinese dialogues. Experimental results show our method outperform previous models like TextRank, TFIDF rank and KNN.},

Finding the leading objects has become an important topic. These research topics are always centered around finding the most popular pages or experts. In this paper, we propose a new notion of expertise, which we call user insight. User insight denotes the user's expertise in finding Web pages that are useful or have the potential to be popular pages before other users find them. To address the issue, we refer to three major types of Web pages, namely, isolated, well-known, and burgeoning. Burgeoning pages are exceptionally useful and attractive for users in a folksonomy system. In our paper, we build a time-based algorithm to estimate user insight. In addition, we discuss the social relationship within fan networks, and we propose a link-based algorithm called CAIS (Community-based Annotation Insight Search) to realize the reinforcement between users, communities and pages. Finally, we design several experiments to evaluate the performance of CAIS and compare it to other approaches. We prove that CAIS has a better performance for the user ranking of simulated data and real data from Delicious.},

To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

Toward overcoming these challenges, we propose a community-based smoothing approach that seeks to uncover hidden conceptual communities which link multiple related locations by their common interests in addition to their proximity. Through extensive experiments over a sample of millions of geotagged Twitter posts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the smoothing approach and validate the intuition that geo-locations have the tendency to share similar “ideas” in the formation of conceptual communities.},

This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

To include candidate tags beyond the existing vocabularies of the query resource and of the query user, we examine recommendation methods that are based on personomy translation, and propose a probabilistic framework for adopting translations from similar users (neighbors). We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

We present an alternative approach that facilitates the generation of the structured metadata which is useful for querying the database. Document annotations are comments, notes, or other types of external remarks that can be attached to a document. Our approach relies on the idea that humans can add the valuable metadata during creation time prompted by an interface. We can increase the quality of searching to some extent, if the documents are properly annotated. Existing probabilistic approaches have some demerits. This paper proposes an approach that uses inverted indexing scheme for effective mining of informations.

This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

Results obtained show that high precision can be achieved in propagating the top ranked topic label, and that 2-gram and 3-gram feature representations optimize the precision.},

  abstract  = {On the web, most structured document collections consist of documents from different sources and marked up with different types of structures. The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness. We introduce a generic and flexible structured document model to represent heterogeneous structured documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections. We also illustrate how the proposed model can be utilized in structured document retrieval.},

Social media has increasingly become an important tool for analyzing drug use patterns and monitoring emerging drug abuse trends. Accurately retrieving illicit drug-related social media posts is an important step in this research. Frequently, hashtags are used to identify and retrieve posts on a specific topic. However hashtags are highly ambiguous. Posts with the same hashtags are not always on the same topic. Moreover, hashtags are evolving, especially those related to illicit drugs. New street names are introduced constantly to avoid detection. In this paper, we employ topic modeling to disambiguate hashtags and track the changes of hashtags using semantic word embedding. Our preliminary evaluation shows the promise of these methods.},

These networking spaces generally emerged from desktop applications for organizing bibliographic references to social networking environments setup to share and tag citations for scholars. Two of the most important reference management tools, Mendeley and Zotero, are described in detail. Mendeley has the largest bibliographic database where users can read and tag the publications that other members share in the public catalogue. However, its networking functionalities are hardly exploited at all, which casts serious doubts on its future as a social networking platform. Zotero, on the other hand, is a local, reduced platform occupied above all by American users from the Humanities and Social Sciences. Nevertheless, the great limitation of this platform is that it does not have a public catalogue of the references added to the service, which impedes the sharing of references between members. As a result of this users employ groups as the means to achieve collaboration. },

A Web Service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network, and Web Services are becoming a popular way for digital libraries to supply their content to other systems and interfaces that are designed to satisfy particular user needs. The Z39.50 standard defines a wide-ranging protocol for information retrieval between a client and a database server. The Z39.50 protocol is divided into eleven logical sections called facilities that each provides a broad set of services. A particular Z39.50 system need not implement all parts of the protocol. Indeed, the protocol is so complex that full implementation is a daunting undertaking and may in any case be inappropriate for a particular digital library site. The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was motivated by the electronic preprint community, which has a strong desire to increase the availability of scholarly repositories and to enhance access to them. OAI-PMH imposes no requirements on how metadata is represented on the server of a data provider. The metadata can be stored in a database, as simple \{XML\} files, or even embedded within other documents. },

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary E-discovery is a broad and encompassing topic. The enhancements, improvements, and other changes in corporate best practices are emerging on a near daily basis. Major areas where corporations are looking at e-discovery and changes to its landscape include: focus on litigation preparedness, emergence of better enterprise searches, centralization of e-discovery activities and actions, insourcing the e-discovery review process, emergence of folksonomies, record accessibility and retention policies, centralization of e-discovery activities and actions, and complications from “e-discovery trolls.” In corporations worldwide, but especially in the United States, there is an increased focus on being prepared to respond to and vigorously defend matters surrounding pending litigation. Particularly with regard to the recently amended Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and the new requirements in e-discovery, counsel and companies are paying new attention to both how to avoid and how to respond to lawsuits. New enterprise search platform features are emerging to integrate with litigation support software to help corporations get their arms around their data. These platforms are offering advances such as conceptual search, automatic categorization, and advanced algorithms. E-discovery trolls are emerging and making up a newly significant threat to firms. This really hinges on the emergence of the new \{FRCP\} code as it pertains to e-discovery. Folksonomic tagging allows users to create their own tags, which are freely chosen and not part of a strictly controlled vocabulary. This type of social tagging is sure to make e-discovery search and review efforts easier. The spiraling costs of e-discovery are prompting more corporate legal teams—the in-house counsel—to do more e-discovery work in-house. Another trend for e-discovery in the coming few years is automated review. },

These sites are the embodiment of the folksonomy philosophy because they aspire to create an information resource which rests exclusively on the participation of its users through the posting and tagging of documents, resulting in a self-organized information system. However, the evolution of each has been opposed, taking them on different courses. While CiteULike was spreading across countries and disciplines, BibSonomy headed to becoming a specialized tool for computer scientists and limited to German-speaking countries. However, at the time that CiteULike is recording a deep stagnation with the gradual slowdown of its functions, Bibsonomy survives with high activity in a small niche. This chapter describes the principal functionalities of each service and analyses quantitatively their document repository, social instruments and user profiles. },

Yet, one of the major inhibitors of this is the constant flux within the industry, driven by rapidly evolving business models, mergers and collaborations. A continued stream of new employees and external partners brings a need to not only manage the new information they generate, but to find and exploit existing company results and reports. The ability to synthesise this vast information ‘substrate’ into actionable intelligence is crucial to industry productivity. In parallel, the new ‘digital biology’ era provides yet more and more data to find, analyse and exploit. In this chapter we look at the contribution that Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) technology has made to meeting the information challenges faced by Pfizer. We describe two use-cases that highlight the flexibility of this software and the ultimate benefit to the user. },

This chapter is devoted to explication of the typical or standard approaches to capturing the knowledge base of a community. How we go about capturing this knowledge base, specifically, is what constitutes our domain analytical methodology. A methodology is a plan for research that quite specifically lays out which tools will be used and why. Operational parameters for domain analytic research require that the context is in the first instance a unit of analysis for the construction of a knowledge organization system. Whether it is our intent immediately to construct such a system or to leave it for others in subsequent work, our purpose in unraveling the extension and intension of a domain is to ascertain the concepts and their characteristics that constitute the functional knowledge base of the community under consideration. The second consideration is that a domain is a group. Methodologically then, the unit of analysis must be, in some way, a visible functional group. The remaining aspects of a domain that can be extracted by analysis are an ontological base that reveals an underlying teleology; a set of common hypotheses; an epistemological consensus on methodological approaches; and, social semantics. Any or all of the empirical methods described in Chapter 4, such as term extraction, thematic analysis, and visualization of author cocitation clusters should point to these aspects of domain coherence. },

The extent of humanities and digital humanities scholarship at academic institutions translates into support for archives and special collections, as Digital Humanities faculty and students will, at different stages of their projects, use digital collections at their institutions’ archives and research libraries. The extent of digital curation initiatives ranges from one department—usually a combined archives and special collections unit—to multiple units including the archives, technical services, information technologists, academic departments, and the community at large. This chapter focuses on the organizational dimensions of digital curation, placing the digital curation lifecycle in a higher education institution’s context. It will discuss at length the role of knowledge architectures and knowledge transfer in digital curation in four distinct settings: archives, academic library, institution, and community. This approach aims to demonstrate the relationship of the digital lifecycle model to curation initiatives at various levels of the institution and surround communities. },

Publisher Summary This chapter describes the resilience, which is the capability of an information space to shape and adapt itself to the different range of users, needs, and seeking strategies. To build resilient environments it is necessary to look at information architecture as a dynamic process evolving in space and time, spanning different channels, media, or environments and where people are an integral component and active players. Resilience can be augmented by tracing and tracking the interactions between people and information, places, and other people through time and by allowing them to shape or reshape the process. Two case studies illustrate the concept of resilience as it can be applied to museum design and television broadcasting. The chapter defines a synchronic society that generates trillions of catalogable, searchable, trackable trajectories: patterns of design, manufacturing, distribution, and recycling that are maintained in fine-grained detail. },

The scope and extent of curation programs vary from organization to organization and range from extensive curation initiatives at large institutions designating entire departments for digital curation to small-scale curation efforts at smaller institutions with a solo curator or none, with most curation initiatives falling between these extremes. This chapter will use the Digital Curation Centre's Lifecycle model as the framework for implementing digital curation programs from conceptualization activities to assessments. The chapter will also consider a broader conceptualization of curation; digital humanities curation and social curation play a crucial role in the construction of meanings around heritage collections, which positively impacts the usage statistics—therefore the relevance—of heritage collections. },

Libraries are adopting technological tools and approaches to closely fit library services to the lifestyles of their communities. One exemplar of such integration in the design and delivery of library services is the use of labels with deeper meanings to denote improved service models. A number of controversies hamper the adoption of such terms to label new ideas, models and techniques of librarianship, particularly the use of version numbers, largely exemplified by what some scholars call the ‘point oh’ phenomenon. This chapter explores these developments. },

These requests are often challenging to satisfy, due to the disconnection between the words users employ and the attributes used in systems for image retrieval. Image collections must be supported by a robust metadata structure that can accommodate and preserve a variety of discipline-specific metadata while supporting consistent access across collections, but metadata creation is one of the most expensive components of digital projects. This chapter investigates the challenges of image description, both at the item and collection level and considerations for subject description; it also explores the practical and philosophical challenges posed by the indexing aspect of image metadata construction, summarizes current practices, and outlines the factors that influence decisions about metadata created for digital content. },

In recent years, learning methods have been superior in many applications, in which semi-supervised learning (SSL) can estimate the structure underlying both the labeled and unlabeled data. \{SSL\} is applicable to V3DOR. \{SSL\} methods can explore not only the pairwise object relevance but also the joint relevance among multiple objects. In the \{SSL\} framework, several recent works have introduced learning-based 3DOR methods. In this chapter, we briefly discuss these learning-based methods, including Hausdorff distance learning, bipartite graph optimal matching, and hypergraph learning. },

Although information architecture is not a substitute for curation or archiving, the field can effectively inform curators about the internal and extended structures of Web content requiring preservation and documentation. Curators may use structural and preservation metadata for such purposes. There is also a direct relationship between information architecture and hypertextuality, which represent several forms of hypertext in digital history projects. Understanding these forms will help curators assess the structure of large-scale projects and prepare proper documentation. This chapter focuses on the place of information architecture in digital curation where it helps curators assess the diverse structures of information spaces and the relationships of interrelated resources. },

The digitization of selections from special collections, manuscripts, photographs, and other historical media has made it possible for worldwide audiences to access information about places, communities, people, and events. Social media has made it even easier for audiences to interact with the content and network with others to discuss their ancestry, inquire about places, and share information about upcoming events. This chapter focuses on implications of social networks for digital curation and addresses social curation ecosystems. Cross-curation results from the ability of social media to connect audiences across networks via automatic feeds and human-initiated actions, increasing the virality of topics, which in turn outlines a social curation ecosystem where actions in one region of the system can have varying effects elsewhere. Social networks are different in design, attracting different audiences, but connecting them across the various networks will enable curators to reach out to a wider audience. The projects at the Ward M. Canaday Center, especially Toledo's Attic, emphasizes the potential value of social media in the work of heritage institutions. },

It also describes the potential of controlled vocabularies or authoritative sources of information which can be shared, reused, and function as nodes of linked data not only by libraries but also by other communities. In the final part of the chapter the impact that the users of social networks as well as machines have on generating metadata as linked open data will be discussed. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: In this chapter, after a quick history of MIR’s principles, a series of clarifications on the state-of-the-art developments and the problems arising from such studies are presented. Some important future directions of study and research are then indicated. With regard to the usefulness of MIR’s methods, it is pointed out how research and experimentation for improving the structure and methodology of systems should always be based on the actual needs of users, and their responses to the new operational proposals. In investigating the actual functionality of \{MIR\} systems, the discussion of the limitations of the contentual objective access to documents is decisive and mathematically objective, as is the discussion of the gap between it and the conceptual-interpretive access, both internationally appointed as the semantic gap. Since the meaning of a multimedia document is rarely explicit, the goal of the system must be to provide support to overcome this gap between the simplicity of content processing offered by the machine and the rich semantic expectations of the user. A suggested solution is integrating into \{MIR\} the method of the ontologies, new guides for navigating the Semantic Web. It is about establishing a truly organic approach to multimedia search, able to take into account univocally the concrete and conceptual, the contentual and semantic representativeness of documents. Finally, accepting as a solution the use of ontologies as being compatible with MIR, to escape their rigours it is hypothetically valid to combine ontologies with folksonomies as systems for the free collaborative content categorization of documents based on labels assigned directly by end-users. The integration between the semantic tools of ontologies and folksonomies, which in turn are integrated with content-based tools, can reconcile the opposition between the principles of semantic-interpretative treatments and contentual objective treatments in the general organic tools of MIR. },

  abstract  = {Abstract: Since web catalogs completely eliminated card catalogs in the 1990s there has been little substantive change in the way they work. All of them have the traditional card catalog searches, as well as keyword. There is an option to refine searches to bring in a more focused, manageable set, but extensive research has shown that this option is almost never taken. This chapter shows that as the twenty-first century saw the rise of Google, the expectations of library users changed, with more patrons being dissatisfied with the classic online catalog, which they saw as containing too much library jargon. It looks at the rise of a new type of catalog that overlaid the classic catalog and delivered a more intuitive look. It had tag clouds and facets to limit the results to certain types of material or locations. Since libraries were running both types of catalogs simultaneously, it was easy to find out if they were more likely to limit a search in a discovery catalog. Several libraries reported that users were 20 times more likely to refine a search in a discovery catalog. },

  abstract  = {Abstract Semantics plays an important role in the accurate analysis of the context of a sentiment expression. We analyze this role from two perspectives: the way semantics is encoded in sentiment resources, such as lexica, corpora, and ontologies, and the way it is used by automatic systems that perform sentiment analysis on social media data. Specifically, we review and discuss state-of-the-art methods and tools that rely on semantic models and resources, possibly enabling reasoning, so as to deal with some key challenges for sentiment analysis. Examples of such challenges are context dependency and finer-grained sentiment detection, which can translate into the assigning of sentiment values to aspects of objects or into the design and use of a wider spectrum of affective labels, or the use of current techniques in finer-grained semantic processing. In our dealing with semantics, lexical aspects must be combined with pragmatic and cognitive issues, and other dimensions involved in conveying sentiment, such as emotions. },

  abstract  = {Abstract With the rapid advances in multimedia, communication, and Internet technology, today there is an ever-increasing amount of multimedia content with rich metadata tags on the Web. Of this massive multimedia data, image and video data represent major proportions and contain rich content information, which is very accessible for human observation and manipulation. Image and video datasets are also widely used in medical analysis, digital libraries, computer vision, and intelligent vehicles. Consequently, how to organize such digital media toward effective indexing and search is recognized as one of the fundamental challenges in the above fields, with a bright future in both academic and industrial research. Consequently, due to the incomplete annotations of multimedia data on the Web, there is a huge semantic gap between the image/video content and its textual/semantic description, which has been the core problem in multimedia analysis research thus far. Generally speaking, photographing operation from a real-world three-dimensional scene into a two-dimensional \{RGB\} image is an irreversible process that introduces problems in image and video content understanding, as well as visual search and recognition applications. Therefore, the representation, indexing and search techniques of image and video data has been a longstanding focus in research fields such as computer vision, multimedia analysis, and information retrieval, while serving as an emerging demand to improve the multimedia search services for big companies such as Google and Yahoo!. },

The changing forms and structures of information, its origins, the emergence of preferred and consensual information, the knowledge and ignorance of the contexts of its emergence and the experiences of abundance and scarcity of information all affect our possibilities to know things. Digital information is not restricted by the limits of physical space even though its users are still very much physical beings. It is created and made available in new forms, which have very little in common with the old representations of information. Information emerged in new environments in new ways and the information we retrieve for our daily pursuits of knowing is also filtered and channelled in new ways. A highly complex and unclear notion of relevance has become a guiding principle of the choice of information, even if we know very little of how and why we are consulting one particular piece of information instead of another. },

The underlying problems are the inability of keywords to express the semantics of a query, and the functional possibilities and limitations of web applications. Searching for information is difficult and time intensive because of the lower efficiency of keyword-based search; results are often very different from the information seeker’s expectations/requirements. The human mind understands and processes information in multiple dimensions, thus the search method should also involve multiple facets. Facet analysis has been applied to knowledge organization in library and information science and also in artificial intelligence for the design of information retrieval systems. A simplified model to interface between users, information depositors, data repositories, and search engines could lead to the development of a tool which is understandable to both machine and human. The model would be based on the concept of facets and facetization so as to handle the conceptual aspect, and would also be translated to Semantic Web languages for comprehensibility by robots and crawlers. },

  abstract = {The system presented in this article aims to improve information access through the use of semantic annotation utilizing a non-traditional approach. Instead of applying semantic annotations to enhance the internal information access mechanisms, we use them to empower the user of an information access system through an innovative named entity-based user interface – NameSieve. NameSieve was built to support an intelligence analyst during the process of exploratory search, an advanced type of search requiring multiple iterations of retrieval interleaved with browsing and analyzing the retrieved information. The proposed approach was implemented in the NameSieve system so that the system can transparently present a summary of search results in the form of entity “clouds.” Therefore, these clouds allow the analyst to further explore the results in a novel manner, acting together as a faceted browsing interface. We ran a user study (with ten subjects) to examine the effect of NameSieve, and the study results reported in the paper demonstrate that this new way of applying semantic annotation information was actively used and was evaluated positively by the subjects. It enabled the subjects to work more productively and bring back most relevant documents.},

  abstract        = {Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

However, developers need to analyze user feedback in order to assess its relevance and potential impact, which bears several challenges due to its quantity, quality, structure, and content, particularly when feedback volume is high. In this paper we present the results of a case study to explore which role collaborative tagging can play to improve user feedback, in particular, its impact on the navigation within, understandability, and structure of user feedback. Our results indicate that collaborative tagging might contribute to decrease the pain when analyzing and organizing user feedback. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

Consequently, we conduct the extensive evaluation on top of three distinct collaborative tagging systems. The graph-based methods perform significantly better for the Movielens and Bibsonomy datasets.

A number of models of tagging behaviour have been proposed to identify factors that are considered to affect taggers, such as users' tagging history. In this paper, we use Semiotics Analysis and Activity theory, to study the effect the system designer has over tagging behaviour. The framework we use shows the components that comprise the tagging system and how they interact together to direct tagging behaviour. We analysed two collaborative tagging systems: CiteULike and Delicious by studying their components by applying our framework. Using datasets from both systems, we found that 35% of CiteULike users did not provide tags compared to only 0.1% of Delicious users. This was directly linked to the type of tools used by the system designer to support tagging.},

  abstract        = {Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, such as web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  note            = {cited By},
  abstract        = {As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Ontologies, folksonomy and personomy are employed in KAM to constitute the useful repositories of knowledge. Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction, very useful for capturing the semantics of information repositories, but they can not reflect the user's interest. The user in KAM can freely choose the words to tag the resources which are the reflection of the user's own interest. The set of tags and tagged knowledge of a user comprise the personomy. In a group the shared tags and knowledge are known as folksonomy. Our approach investigates how to map these tags in personomy and folksonomy to existing domain ontology in order to add accurate meanings. The user's behaviors are also used to re-rank the query results. So the user can find the useful knowledge quickly and accurately.},

They allow the use of folksonomies as a useful structure for a number of tasks in the social web, such as navigation and knowledge organization. One of the main deficiencies comes from the tagging behaviour of different users which causes semantic heterogeneity in tagging. As a consequence a user cannot benefit from the adequate tagging of others. In order to solve the problem, an agent-based reconciliation knowledge system, based on Formal Concept Analysis, is applied to facilitate the semantic interoperability between personomies. This article describes experiments that focus on conceptual structures produced by the system when it is applied to a collaborative tagging service, Delicious.

Set search requires relevant sets to be retrieved to meet information needs of users. It is different from individual object search in terms of content granularity. While a web object itself is not divisible and independent with each other, a set consists of separable objects that are related in some aspects. This paper proposes a new approach that can effectively measure topical relevance of sets against a user query by utilizing the tags attached to web objects. The main idea of the proposed approach is to prefer the set which covers as many query related subtopics as possible. In particular, in order to compute the topical relevance while addressing the problem of noisy tags, the notion of tag significance score is introduced based on tag co-occurrence frequency. We consider a problem domain of photo set search at flickr.com where individual photos are annotated with texts such as titles and tags. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous approaches for photo set retrieval. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

In order to extract semantics of tags, we developed the emotion ontology for music called UniEmotion, which categorizes tags into positive emotional tags, negative emotional tags, and factual tags. According to the types of the tags, their weights are calculated and assigned to them. After then, user profiles using the weighted tags were generated and a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm was executed. To evaluate our approach, a data set of 1,100 users, tags which they added, and artists which they listened to was collected from last.fm. The conventional track-based recommendation, the unweighted tag-based recommendation, and the weighted tag-based recommendation are compared in terms of precision. Our experimental results show that the weighted tag-based recommendation outperforms other two approaches in terms of precision. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Background: Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. Objective: The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. Methods: First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. Results: Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.},

A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Here we explore how simple models of boundedly rational human decision making may partly account for the high-level properties of a collaborative tagging environment, in particular with respect to the distribution of tags used across the folkson-omy. We discuss several plausible heuristics people might employ to decide on tags to use for a given item, and then describe methods for testing evidence of such strategies in real collaborative tagging data. Using a large dataset of annotations collected from users of the social music website Last.fm with a novel crawling methodology (approximately one millions total users), we extract the parameters for our decision-making models from the data. We then describe a set of simple multi-agent simulations that test our heuristic models, and compare their results to the extracted parameters from the tagging dataset. Results indicate that simple social copying mechanisms can generate surprisingly good fits to the empirical data, with implications for the design and study of tagging systems.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems allow users to describe and organize items using labels in a free-shared vocabulary (tags), improving their browsing experience in large collections of items. At present, the most accurate collaborative filtering techniques build user profiles in latent factor spaces that are not interpretable by users. In this paper, we propose a general method to build linear-interpretable user profiles that can be used for user interaction in a recommender system, using the well-known simple additive weighting model (SAW) for multi-attribute decision making. In experiments, two kinds of user profiles where tested: one from free contributed tags and other from keywords automatically extracted from textual item descriptions. We compare them for their ability to predict ratings and their potential for user interaction. As a test bed, we used a subset of the database of the University of Minnesota's movie review system-Movielens, the social tags proposed by Vig et al. (2012) in their work "The Tag Genome", and movie synopses extracted from the Netflix's API. We found that, in "warm" scenarios, the proposed tag and keyword-based user profiles produce equal or better recommendations that those based on latent-factors obtained using matrix factorization. Particularly, the keyword-based approach obtained 5.63% of improvement. In cold-start conditions-movies without rating information, both approaches perform close to average. Moreover, a user profile visualization is proposed arising an accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff between tag and keyword-based profiles. While keyword-based profiles produce more accurate recommendations, tag-based profiles seems to be more readable, meaningful and convenient for creating profile-based user interfaces.

In this paper we propose an adaptation of the search algorithms proposed in [14, 1] to the tag recommendation problem. Our algorithm, called STRec, provides networkaware recommendations based on proximity measures computed on-the-fly in the network. STRec uses a bounded search to find good neighbors. On top of STRec, we apply a re-ranking scheme that improves the quality of the recommendations. We update the ranking according to the degree of association between the higher ranked tags and the lower ranked ones. This technique leads to better recommendations as we show in this paper and could be applicable on top of many recommender systems.

In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based profile extraction. We believe that for a better result, tags of a resource must represent well its content. Existing systems consider 'Popularity' as the unique criterion to judge the tag effectiveness. But it does not always reflect its importance and representativeness to the resource.

These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions-from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E steps technique-Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution-which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy-expressed in a FO-to support ontology review and enhancement.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular tools for Web search users to find their desired information. Indeed, the informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. The widely keyword-based approaches used for locating information on the Web, are hence not straightforwardly adaptable to folksonomies. This drawback has created the need for an effective framework to support folksonomy users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this paper is to propose an integrated approach for context-aware query recommendation infolksonomies that exploits the power of both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and triadic concepts. We demonstrate through carried out experiments that the proposed approach yields mainly highly Precise and highly Relevant tag query recommendation.},

Both sustainability and stabilization are essential to the mining and categorization of information driven by tagging behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on time series data of CiteULike from November 2004 to April 2010. Power law distributions were detected to reveal statistical regularities and tagging patterns. Logistic regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted to identify the factors affecting the growth of distinct tags for articles. The significance of the effects and the time taken for a given article to reach its tagging maturity were also explored. Findings - Time series plots and trend analysis illustrated the continuous growth of the tagging system. Exploratory analysis of power law distribution fittings indicated a sign of system stability known as scale invariance. Logistic regression results demonstrated that for a particular article, the number of users who tagged the article, the initial date when the article was tagged, and the life span of the article are statistically significant to the ratio of the distinct tag number to the total tag number for a given article. These results confirmed that the distinct tag ratio of an article gives rise to a stable pattern. Originality/value - Though extensive work has been done on the patterns of tag vocabulary, it is not clear how the growth of distinctive tags behaves in relation to the total number of tag applications, considering time-dependent covariates such as the number of users, and the longevity of an article. This paper sets to complement the literature on the existing methodology and investigate this property in detail. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Past work has addressed such prob- lems individually for specific applications, but has lacked a generalizable framework for performing both classification and prediction of topic usage. Our approach is to model a topic as a temporally ordered sequence of derived feature states and capture characteristic changes in the topic trend. These sequences are drawn from a dynamic segmentation of frequency data based on change point analysis. We employ Partitioning Around Medoids clustering on these segments to produce signatures which highlight characteristic patterns of usage growth and decay. We demonstrate how this signa- ture model can be used to define distinctive classes of topics in multiple online contexts, including tagging systems and web-based information retrieval. Additionally, we show how the model can predict the general trajectory of interest in a particular topic. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

  abstract        = {A new collaborative approach in information organization and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI), which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric. The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree. The results of this study can be applicable to the study of filtering social tags based on CI; filtered social tags may be utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging has emerged as an efficient way to semantically describe online resources shared by a community of users. However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

  abstract      = {Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users. We analyze the performance of two probabilistic approaches to recommend tags from users with similar tagging behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

  abstract        = {Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

As the large majority of users enters only very few tags, good tag recommendation can vastly improve the usability of tags for techniques such as searching, indexing, and clustering. Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

The problem we consider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying on information-theoretic concepts, we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity, and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard, and we propose a greedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is equipped with strategies for pruning the search space deriving directly from the objective function. We also prove a property that allows assessing the level of informativeness for newly added dimensions, thus allowing to define criteria for terminating the decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets with known dimension and three real-world datasets, flickr, del. icio. us and dblp. The problem we study is largely motivated by applications in the domain of collaborative tagging; however, the mining task we introduce in this paper is useful in other application domains as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

Curated sets of users (or "Search Parties") form the basis of sourcing the content from the networks, and the metadata of the containing messages form the basis of ranking and contextual retrieval of the hyperlinks. Each hyperlink is indexed with a compound set of terms from multiple tweets (should the given hyperlink be shared more than once). This indexing step is a novel example of collaborative tagging of resources. The application is live with more than 100 users, who have performed approximately 1000 queries.

Users' input through collaborative commenting or tagging can be very useful in organizing and classifying documents. Some web sites (e.g. Google Image Labeler) support a collection of tags and labels, but a large fraction of these sites do not currently support such activities. Moreover, relying upon centrally controlled web-service providers for such support is probably not a good idea if the objective is to make the collaborative inputs publicly available. Often, business entities offering such web-based tagging environments end up owning and monetizing the result of the collective effort. This paper takes a step toward addressing this problem-it proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (PADMINI), powered by distributed data mining algorithms. In particular, it focuses on learning a P2P classifier from tagged text data.

Such practice, also known as social or collaborative tagging, has the purpose of collecting and sharing opinions about Web resources and simplifying their retrieval. In this paper, we go one step further and show how tags can have more enhanced applications to be exploited for customizing Web content fruition. More precisely, we propose a multi-layer framework where data collected by social tagging communities are complemented with additional services. Such services provide users the ability of expressing their dis/agreement with existing tags, denoting the members they trust based on their characteristics and relationships, or specifying policies on which "quality" assessment of resources should be returned. Besides providing the formal specification of the proposed framework, we illustrate two case studies we have implemented and the experiments we have carried out in order to verify the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i. e., Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It supports our argument that existing approaches do not explore the full potential of the combination between folksonomies and ontologies due to their unidirectionality. The framework is also the basis to evidence that a fusion approach - -as proposed in our "folksonomized ontology" - -enables to better explore the organic semantics of folksonomies combined to the engineered semantics of ontologies. © 2012 ACM.},

The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items from a public pool of items (e.g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a query should be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers' search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully-personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). © 2012 ACM.},

A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. In this paper an intelligent tag recommendation agent is proposed, that recommends tags for bookmarks stored in one of the popular social bookmarking websites, Del.ici.ou.1 We develop various probabilistic approaches to recommend tags to be used by users while adding new bookmarks. We have developed content-based and collaborative filtering mechanism that are used by these recommendation agents. Additionally, these tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. This approach can therefore be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for social networks. We also empirically verify the hypothesis that similar web pages are tagged with similar tags.

  abstract      = {Due to the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, the research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other related concepts is becoming an important interdisciplinary area with great potential and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely 'flat', while in some cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags. However, usually no overall hierarchical organization of the tags is given, and one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there are also other types of tagged networks available for research, where the tags are already organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the 'is a sub-category of' type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper, we study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes marked by the tags in various real networks. The motivation for this research was the fact that understanding the tagging based on a known hierarchy can help in revealing the hidden hierarchy of tags in collaborative tagging systems.We analyse the relation between the tagfrequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG (i.e. their rank or significance as characterized by, e.g., the length of the branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features of tag co-occurrence. This model has high potential for further practical applications, e.g., it can provide the starting point for a benchmark system in ontology retrieval or it may help pinpoint unusual correlations in the co-occurrence of tags. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

  abstract        = {Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%. © 2012 ACM.},

SynTag generates real-time thumbnails by using real-time tags for presenters to receive instant feedback and for other users to retrieve presentation videos. In a pilot study, we found our users' tagging behaviors significantly different when they were in lecture events or discussion events.

As a kind of descriptive keyword, large amount of tags are created and associated to multiple types of resources, e. g., web pages, photos, videos and tweets. Users' tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing the temporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web. Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However, there exist remarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect bursty tagging event, which captures the relations among a group of correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It profiles the events with more representative and comprehensible clues. The proposed approach is divided into three stages. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events. We discuss the choice of similarity and granularity for event detection. After that, we further utilize an automatically generated tag taxonomy to organize bursty events to facilitate the burst oriented navigation and analysis. The experimental study on a large real data set demonstrates the superiority of our new approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In such cases collecting community descriptions in forms of structured tags can be a more affordable approach to describe Web services. However, little is understood about how tagging impacts performance of retrieval. There are neither real structured tagging systems for Web services, nor real corpora of structured tags. To start addressing these issues, in our approach, we motivated taggers to tag services in a partially controlled environment. Specifically, taggers were given application requirements and asked to find and tag services that match the requirements. Tags collected in this way were used for Web service matchmaking and evaluated within the framework of the Cross-Evaluation Track of the Third Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest. As part of the lessons learned, we explain relations between description schema (SWS, tags, flat document) and matchmaking heuristics, and performance of retrieval in different search scenarios. We also analyze reliability of tagging system performance as related to taggers/searchers autonomy. Finally, we identify threats to results credibility stemming from partial control of the tags collection process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

With the increasingly large amount of data, how to assist users in searching their interested resources by utilizing these semantic tags becomes a crucial problem. Collaborative tagging systems provide an environment for users to annotate resources, and most users give annotations according to their perspectives or feelings. However, users may have different perspectives or feelings on resources, e.g., some of them may share similar perspectives yet have a conflict with others. Thus, modeling the profile of a resource based on tags given by all users who have annotated the resource is neither suitable nor reasonable. We propose, to tackle this problem in this paper, a community-aware approach to constructing resource profiles via social filtering. In order to discover user communities, three different strategies are devised and discussed. Moreover, we present a personalized search approach by combining a switching fusion method and a revised needs-relevance function, to optimize personalized resources ranking based on user preferences and user issued query. We conduct experiments on a collected real life dataset by comparing the performance of our proposed approach and baseline methods.

Spontaneously generated information has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. New technologies, such as blogs, Twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, enable the creation and dissemination of content in a relatively simple way. As a result, the aggregate body of knowledge is growing at an accelerated rate. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Research has shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. Research has shown that individuals respond quickly and massively to emergencies, and that they try to help with the situation. Thus, it seems like a logical step to attempt to harness collective knowledge for emergency management. Disaster relief groups and field command frequently suffer from lack of up to date information, which may be critical in a rapidly evolving situation. Some of this information could be generated by the crowd at large, enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for the introduction of collective knowledge in disaster relief and present architecture and examples of how this could be accomplished. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Information representation in engineering design is currently dominated by top-down approaches such as taxonomies and ontologies. While top-down approaches provide support for computational reasoning, they are primarily limited due to their static nature, limited scope, and developer-centric focus. Bottom-up approaches, such as folksonomies, are emerging as means to address the limitations of top-down approaches. Folksonomies refer to collaborative classification by users who freely assign tags to design information. They are dynamic in nature, broad in scope, and are user focused. However, they are limited due to the presence of ambiguities and redundancies in the tags used by different people. Considering their complementary nature, the ideal approach is to use both top-down and bottom-up approaches in a synergistic manner. To facilitate this synergy, the goal in this paper is to present techniques for using dynamic folksonomies to extract global characteristics of the structure of design information, and to create hierarchies of tags that can guide the development of structured taxonomies and ontologies. The approach presented in this paper involves using (a) tools such as degree distribution and K-neighborhood connectivity analysis to extract the global characteristics of folksonomies and (b) set-based technique and hierarchical clustering to develop a hierarchy of tags. The approach is illustrated using data from a collective innovation platform that supports collaborative tagging for design information. It is shown that despite the flat nature of the folksonomies insights about the hierarchy in information can be gained. The effects of various parameters on the tag hierarchy are discussed. The approach has potential to be used synergistically with top-down approaches such as ontologies to support the next generation collaborative design platforms. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

  abstract        = {With the fast development of the Internet, there are more and more learning resources including various multimedia resources on the Web. Meanwhile, e-learning becomes more popular and important due to its convenience and autonomy. However, how to help users conduct high quality resource retrieval remains a challenge and should be considered first for an e-learning system. The traditional indexing approach which classifies multimedia resources into predefined categories can hardly meet user demands. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems provide users with a simple but powerful mechanism to obtain required multimedia resources. Moreover, feedbacks made by users can be utilized to refine the retrieval results during the interactive process between users and systems. In this paper, we present an interactive tutoring system with personalized multimedia resource search, based on a collaborative tagging mechanism. We also describe several application scenarios in which content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is combined with collaborative tagging to facilitate interactive tutoring in our cooking recipe database system. © 2011 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tagabstrcatsness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of wordabstrcatness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and Wikitaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data.},

Consequently, the resolution of semantic ambiguity of tag sense (i.e., meaning) plays an important role in the enhancement of information organization and retrieval in collaborative tagging applications. Our approach to tackle the task of automatic resolution of semantic ambiguity is based on the hypothesis that given a target tag, some of the co-occurring social tags that were selectively assigned by the same or by different people to the same resource can serve as a useful dataset. Four different methods (i.e., two LSA-based, LIN-based, and Cooccurrence method) for tag sense disambiguation are proposed and their results are compared, aiming to automatically rank the senses associated with a given target tag. The experimental results with a Delicious dataset indicate that LSA-w and LIN-based methods produce more stable performances, and suggest the same two methods for the Tag Sense Disambiguation task, particularly in the situation that the Boolean effect is more likely to arise.},

Current tag-based recommender systems mainly take the explicit structural information among users, resources and tags into consideration, while neglecting the important implicit semantic relationships hidden in tagging data. In this study, we propose a Semantic Enhancement Recommendation strategy (SemRec), based on both structural information and semantic information through a unified fusion model.

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

In this article, we propose a subject-centered model of collaborative tagging to account for the ternary cooccurrences involving users, items, and tags in such systems. Extending the well-established probabilistic latent semantic analysis theory for knowledge representation, our model maps the user, item, and tag entities into a common latent subject space that captures the "wisdom of the crowd" resulted from the collaborative tagging process. To put this model into action, we have developed a novel way to estimate the probabilistic subject- centeredmodel approximately in a highly efficient manner taking advantage of amatrix factorization method. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed approach delivers substantial performance improvement on the knowledge resource recommendation task over the state-of-the-art standard and tag-aware resource recommendation algorithms. © 2011 ACM.},

Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

  abstract        = {Video summarisation is one of the most active fields in content-based video retrieval research. A new video summarisation scheme is proposed by this paper based on socially generated temporal tags. To capture users' collaborative tagging activities the proposed scheme maintains video bookmarks, which contain some temporal or positional information about videos, such as relative time codes or byte offsets. For each video all the video bookmarks collected from users are then statistically analysed in order to extract some meaningful key frames (the video equivalent of keywords), which collectively constitute the summary of the video. Compared with traditional video summarisation methods that use low-level audio-visual features, the proposed method is based on users' high-level collaborative activities, and thus can produce semantically more important summaries than existing methods. It is assumed that the video frames around the bookmarks inserted by users are informative and representative, and therefore can be used as good sources for summarising videos. Folksonomy, commonly called collaborative tagging, is a Web 2.0 method for users to freely annotate shared information resources with keywords. It has mostly been used for collaboratively tagging photos (Flickr), web site bookmarks (Del.icio.us), or blog posts (Technorati), but has never been applied to the field of automatic video summarisation. It is believed that this is the first attempt to utilise users' high-level collaborative tagging activities, instead of low-level audio-visual features, for video summarisation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

  abstract        = {In this article, we discuss the notions of experts and expertise in resource discovery in the context of collaborative tagging systems. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. First, an expert should possess a high-quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource in turn depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it, forming a mutual reinforcement relationship. Second, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users discover them, thus bringing these resources to the attention of the community of users. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (spamming-resistant expertise analysis and ranking), which implements the above ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. Our experiments show that our assumptions on expertise in resource discovery, and SPEAR as an implementation of these ideas, allow us to promote experts and demote spammers at the same time, with performance significantly better than the original hypertext-induced topic search algorithm and simple statistical measures currently used in most collaborative tagging systems. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The Web Services architecture supports a system called the Virtual Museum of the Pacific - a content and knowledge acquisition tool that permits the machine synthesis of formal concepts and provides a Rich Internet Application in which to display and navigate them. The Web Services also permit the extensible association of digital objects by inducing new attributes and relationships from museum meta-data, and allows for the ability for users and stakeholders to upload, annotate and attach rich media, YouTube or Vimeo links, and voice narratives to the objects. By rendering these capabilities as an open API, we encourage a connected and open approach to the sharing of cultural heritage and provide platform for further research and development - making our application well suited for mobile devices, Web-based mashups, and data exchange between collection databases. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

  abstract        = {Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tag abstractness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of word abstractness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and WikiTaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

By leveraging social tagging, we propose a new personalized search method to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. Our approach first determines the similarities between resources and between tags. Thereafter, we build two models: a user-tag relation model that reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and a tag-item relation model that captures how a certain tag has been tagged to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly map the tags on the items depending on a particular user's query in order to find the most attractive media content relevant to the user needs.

We first investigate a comprehensive set of expertise evidences related to users, objects and tags in folksonomies. Then we discuss the rich interactions between them and propose a unified Continuous CRF model to integrate these features and interactions.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging is the practice of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize online content. Current collaborative tagging activities within medical blogs are done using free words chosen by users. These tags are not based on standard medical terminologies. The resulted tags are inefficient in terms of medical meanings and semantic interlinking capabilities. In this paper, MTag is presented as a new model for collaborative tagging in medical blogs, i.e. tagging blog entries with medical information. MTag includes two modules: the service module and the semantic module. The service module enables health professionals provide blog posts with auto-completed tags that represent actual medical terms and categorize their tags. Tags are mapped to URIs from online medical knowledge datasets to clarify their medical meaning. At the same time, the semantic module is equipped with a tag ontology which extends the Social Semantic Cloud of Tags (SCOT) ontology to consent medical specifications of tags. Eventually, a prototype is developed to test the MTag's two modules. The results show that both modules are working properly. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The concepts are organized as a map in human mind, however, the tags in folksonomy, which reflect users' collaborative cognition on information, are isolated with current approach. What we do in this paper is to estimate the semantic relatedness among tags in folksonomy: whether tags are related from semantic view, rather than isolated? We introduce different algorithms to form networks of folksonomy, connecting tags by users collaborative tagging, or by resource context. Then we perform multiple measures of semantic relatedness on folksonomy networks to investigate semantic information within them. The result shows that the connections between tags have relatively strong semantic relatedness, and the relatedness decreases dramatically as the distance between tags increases. What we find in this paper could provide useful visions in designing future folksonomy-based systems, constructing semantic web in current state of the Internet, and developing natural language processing applications.},

  abstract        = {Social tagging systems have recently become very popular as a method of categorising information online and have been used to annotate a wide range of different resources. In such systems users are free to choose whatever keywords or "tags" they wish to annotate each resource, resulting in a highly personalised, unrestricted vocabulary. While this freedom of choice has several notable advantages, it does come at the cost of making searching of these systems more difficult as the vocabulary problem introduced is more pronounced than in a normal information retrieval setting. In this paper we propose to use hidden topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall. We first describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a simple topic model and then introduce 2 extended models which can be used to personalise the results by including information about the user who made each annotation. We test these 3 models and compare them with 3 non-topic model baselines on a large data sample obtained from the Delicious social bookmarking site. Our evaluations show that our methods significantly outperform all of the baselines with the personalised models also improving significantly upon unpersonalised LDA. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

PF defines and weighs the feature of tags using 4-D dataset, which can show latent personal interests and long-term personal interests. To decrease the computational complexity, PF constructs a top-N tags set to filter out the undersized dataset. To track the changes of personal interests, PF proposed a novel interest changing algorithm on the 4-D dataset. Some empirical experiments were done and the results shown that the sparsity level of PF is much lower and the computing speed is faster than traditional algorithms. © 2011 NSP.},

We introduce structured collaborative tagging to address these issues. Here, user tags not only aspects relevant for her but also suggested ones (input, output and behavior). Cost, performance and usability of the proposed technique obtained during the Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest are reported. Obtained results suggests that there is no "free lunch." While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Tags are assigned by users to describe and find back items, but it is also tempting to describe the users in terms of the tags they assign or in terms of the tags of the items they are interested in. The tag-based profile thus obtained can be used to recommend new items. If we recommend new items by computing their similarity to the user profile or to all items seen by the user, we run into the risk of recommending only neutral items that are a bit relevant for each topic a user is interested in. In order to increase user satisfaction many recommender systems not only optimize for accuracy but also for diversity. Often it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between accuracy and diversity. In this paper we introduce topic aware recommendation algorithms. Topic aware algorithms first detect different interests in the user profile and then generate recommendations for each of these interests. We study topic aware variants of three tag based recommendation algorithms and show that each of them gives better recommendations than their base variants, both in terms of precision and recall and in terms of diversity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

Basis for these recommendations to adopt to the current context of a knowledge worker can be provided by user models which reflects the topics knowledge workers are dealing with and their corresponding knowledge levels, but research has only focused on user modeling in settings with a static underlying domain model so far. We suggest to model the users' context based on the emergent topics they are dealing with and their individual current knowledge levels within these topics by extracting the necessary information from the user's past activities within the system.

Aiming to identify which are the sources of information (ratings, tags, social contacts, etc.) most valuable for recommendation, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering and social recommenders on a heterogeneous dataset obtained from Last.fm. Moreover, aiming to investigate whether and how fusion of such information sources can benefit individual recommendation approaches, we propose various metrics to measure coverage, overlap, diversity and novelty between different sets of recommendations. The obtained results show that, in Last.fm, social tagging and explicit social networking information provide effective and heterogeneous item recommendations. Moreover, they give first insights on the feasibility of exploiting the above non performance recommendation characteristics by hybrid approaches. © 2010 ACM.},

Specifically, in the following, the users' social connections in consideration were groups. Unlike other studies which utilized groups inferred by data mining technologies, we used the information about the groups in which each user explicitly participated. The group activities are centered on common interests. People join a group to share and acquire information about a topic as a form of community of interest or practice. The information of this group activity may be a good source of information for the members. We tested whether adding the information from the users' own groups or group members to the traditional CF-based recommendations can improve the recommendation quality or not. The information about groups was combined with CF using a mixed hybridization strategy. We evaluated our approach in two ways, using the Citeulike data set and a real user study.

  abstract        = {The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

Let us consider the case of collaborative tagging systems. These systems are an example of complex, self-organized and socially aware systems. The multi-agent systems paradigm coordinated by self-organization mechanisms was used in an effective way for the design and modeling of complex systems. In this paper, we propose a model for the design and development of a new collaborative tagging system, MySURF (My Similar Users, Resources, Folksonomies), using a multi-agent system approach governed by the co-evolution of the social and spatial organizations of the agents. We show how the proposed system offers several new features that can improve current collaborative tagging systems, including clustering of resources and building users' profiles. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Results indicate a steady decrease in the number of unique tags over the four years, suggesting an increasing stability in the community vocabulary over time and the establishment of domain-specific vocabulary. Members reused each others' tags over time and exhibited increasingly collaborative tagging behaviour. Tag discrimination was high, with 4.11 distinct articles per tag. The stable and discriminatory nature of the community's tags suggests that collaborative tagging may serve as a useful resource for vocabulary choice or maintenance by KMS managers. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

To achieve this goal, personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy [11]) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in a collaborative tagging environment. A novel search method using such users' and resources' profiles is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource search. We implement a prototype system named as FMRS.

The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

Consequently, several linguistic problems come to the surface in folksonomies such as; synonyms, polysemy, multilinguality, and others which produce ambiguous and inconsistent classification of data. Therefore, relevant results are not retrieved in the user's query. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to enhance the "social vocabulary" presented in folksonomies with the "controlled vocabulary" presented in Semantic Web ontologies. Therefore, our proposed approach uses the online WordNet lexical ontology in addition to the EuroWordNet multilingual lexical resource. Our approach tries to employ the ontological relations presented in WordNet in the folksonomy, it focuses only on the problems of synonyms, tag relations, and multilinguality.},

  abstract      = {Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the "noise". Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with 3-mode tensors, in order to capture the 3-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multi-way analysis, latent semantic correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Nevertheless, high-order tensors tend be sparse, a fact that hinders the application of multi-way analysis. To address this problem, we propose the application of kernel-based methods, which act as smoothing functions against sparsity. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Bibsonomy), indicates the superiority of the proposed method against the non kernel-based method and also against other baseline methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

  abstract      = {With the increase of media-sharing web sites such as YouTube and Flickr, there are more and more shared multimedia resources on the Web. Multimedia search becomes more important and challenging, as users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, multimedia search needs to take users' personalized information into consideration. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social media. The user profiles obtained from collaborative tagging systems should be very useful for resource retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles from wider perspectives and apply them to personalized resource search in a collaborative tagging environment. We implement a prototype system named as FMRS. Experiments in FMRS show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

It has been argued that the power of tagging lies in the ability for people to freely determine the appropriate tags for resources without having to rely on a predefined lexicon or hierarchy. The freeform nature of tagging causes a number of problems in this social classification scheme, such as synonymy and morphological variety. However, social tagging can be a valuable source of information to help in the organization of Web resources. In this paper we present an empirical analysis carried out to determine the importance of social tagging in Web page classification. Experimental results showed that tag-based classification outperformed classifiers based on full-text of documents. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

In a tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests, and taxonomy is a useful way to organize these tags. As tags change over time, it is imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two key features. Firstly, we develop a novel context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. Secondly, we propose several algorithms for evolutionary taxonomy fusion. We conduct an extensive performance study using a very large real-life dataset (i.e., Del.ici.ous). The empirical results clearly show that our approach is effective and efficient. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, because of the lack of automatic methodologies for generating the tags and supporting the tagging activity, many resources on the Web are deficient in tag information, and recommending opportune tags is both a current open issue and an exciting challenge. This paper approaches the problem by applying a combined set of techniques and tools (that uses tags, domain ontologies, keyphrase extraction methods) thereby generating tags automatically. The proposed approach is implemented in the PIRATES (Personalized Intelligent tag Recommender and Annotator TEStbed) framework, a prototype system for personalized content retrieval, annotation, and classification.

Offline social networks have long been studied in sociology, epidemiology, etc. However, the new online networks offer new ways to revisit old theories as well as to find emerging trends with respect to information diffusion and sharing in the Web 2.0. The goal is to explore and exploit relational ties in a way to enable the mining of useful knowledge and effective information propagation/diffusion. Assuming no or only potential ties explicitly given, the focus is first on the analysis of collaborative tagging and its potentials for user profiling, recommendations and search.

The social annotations contributed by thousands of users can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify documents, or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference methods do not make the best use of social annotation, since they do not take into account variations in individual users' perspectives and vocabulary. In a previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes the interests of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming: the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics of Web resources from social annotations obtained from Delicious in order to discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social knowledge contained in user-generated annotations. © 2010 ACM.},

As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods. © 2010 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

As Twitter evolves, more and more people are partaking in sharing what is happening around the world through various Twitter applications. Hashtag use has become a unique tagging convention to help associate Twitter messages with certain events or contexts. Prefixed by a # symbol with a keyword, a Twitter hashtag serves as a bottom-up user-proposed tagging convention. It also embodies user participation in the process of hashtag innovation, especially as it pertains to information organization tasks. Diffusion of innovation (DoI) is a theory that helps to explain the adoption process of an innovation by modeling its entire life cycle according to the aspects of communications and human information interactions. Hence, diffusion theory offers valuable insights into interface design that supports Twitter hashtag use and access. It also assists in evaluating hashtag life cycles and thus offering information required for decision-making, in regard to hashtag management.},

Tags describe the contents of the resource or provide additional contextual and semantical information to make the content more easily browsable and discoverable by others. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and a certain number of resources have no comments, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context. The results of the evaluation show that tag recommendation based on local lexicon is an effective way to improve collaborative resource sharing in social network.},

  abstract      = {Web 2.0 and social/collaborative tagging have altered the traditional roles of indexer and user. Traditional indexing tools and systems assume the top-down approach to indexing in which a trained professional is responsible for assigning index terms to information sources with a potential user in mind. However, in today's Web, end users create, organize, index, and search for images and other information sources through social tagging and other collaborative activities. One of the impediments to user-centered indexing had been the cost of soliciting user-generated index terms or tags. Social tagging of images such as those on Flickr, an online photo management and sharing application, presents an opportunity that can be seized by designers of indexing tools and systems to bridge the semantic gap between indexer terms and user vocabularies. Empirical research on the differences and similarities between user-generated tags and index terms based on controlled vocabularies has the potential to inform future design of image indexing tools and systems. Toward this end, a random sample of Flickr images and the tags assigned to them were content analyzed and compared with another sample of index terms from a general image collection using established frameworks for image attributes and contents. The results show that there is a fundamental difference between the types of tags and types of index terms used. In light of this, implications for research into and design of user-centered image indexing tools and systems are discussed. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

Automated collaborative document tagging approaches mitigate the problems of manual tagging, but they are usually based on centralized settings which are plagued by problems such as scalability, privacy, etc. To resolve these issues, we present P2P DocTagger, an automated and distributed document tagging system based on classification in P2P networks. P2P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval.

The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

In this paper, we investigate a probabilistic generative model for collaborative tagging, explore the implicit semantic connections in the sparse and noisy information space of heterogeneous users and unsupervised tagging. First, a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to cluster the tags and users simultaneously. The generalization of resource description and user could alleviate the tag noise and data sparseness of recommendation effectively. And then, considering that topic-based recommendation only takes the users' global interest into consideration without the capability of distinguishing users' interest in detail, we combine the global interests with the individual interest and community interest. Experimental results demonstrate the topicbased personalized recommendation method, which integrate both the commonality factor among users and the specialties of individuals, could alleviate data sparsity and provide a more flexible and effective recommendation than previous methods.

To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

  abstract        = {In collaborative filtering recommender systems, there is little room for users to get involved in the choice of their peer group. It leaves users defenseless against various spamming or "shilling" attacks. Other social Web-based systems, however, allow users to self-select peers and build a social network. We argue that users' self-defined social networks could be valuable to increase the quality of recommendation in CF systems. To prove the feasibility of this idea we examined how similar are interests of users connected by self-defined relationships in a collaborative tagging systems Citeulike. Interest similarity was measured by similarity of items and meta-data they share and tags they use. Our study shows that users connected by social networks exhibit significantly higher similarity on all explored levels (items, meta-data, and tags) than non-connected users. This similarity is the highest for directly connected users and decreases with the increase of distance between users. Among other interesting properties of information sharing is the finding that between-user similarity in social connections on the level of metadata and tags is much larger than similarity on the level of items. Overall, our findings support the feasibility of social network based recommender systems and offer some good hints to the prospective authors of these systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Are the tags created by experts demonstrably superior to those of non-experts, and when non-experts have to be used for tagging, is it better to rely on tags created by those who upload videos or on others who watch the videos? Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

  abstract        = {Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Recent research provides evidence for the presence of emergent semantics in collaborative tagging systems. While several methods have been proposed, little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems. A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging: Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others. In this work, we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures. We distinguish between categorizers, who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes, and describers, who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords. To study our hypothesis, we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers. Our results not only show that "verbose" taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics, but also that a subset containing only 40% of the most 'verbose' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset. Moreover, the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics. This work is relevant for designers and analysts of tagging systems interested (i) in fostering the semantic development of their platforms, (ii) in identifying users introducing "semantic noise", and (iii) in learning ontologies. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

In the development of large and complex systems, with a huge number of uncertain stakeholders, the requirements engineering process becomes a challenging task due to overwhelming and dynamic social interactions, tradeoffs, and collective decisions made by above stakeholders. Traditional approaches and techniques are deficient in supporting this kind of social interactions in requirements-related activities, and managing the evolving requirements and their traceability caused by the social interactions. This paper proposes to address the challenges in the pre-requirements analysis of large and complex systems by employing the techniques from collective intelligence based on Web 2.0 tools and technologies, which is composed of three steps: first, obtain collective requirements knowledge through collaborative tagging by stakeholders; second, transform collaborative requirement tags into requirement ontologies; third, support collective requirement decision-making (i.e., collective intelligence) based on the requirement ontologies through requirements reasoning. © 2010 ACM.},

Two novel types of tags are proposed: "deep tags" that apply to a portion of the interaction and "instant tags" that apply to an instant of the interaction. Our system is being used by enterprise users and we analyze a corpus of 737 live-tags collected from 16 conversations that took place over several months. We found that the live-tags for audio have slightly different characteristics from Web 2.0 tags: they are longer and confer affordances on the audio like description and summarization.

These annotations represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they are attached to, but it is not obvious which characteristics of the objects are predominantly described. The usefulness of these tags for finding/re-finding the annotated resources is also not completely clear. Several studies have started to investigate these issues, however only by focusing on a single type of tagging system or resource. We study this problem across multiple domains and resource types and identify the gaps between the tag space and the querying vocabulary. Based on the findings of this analysis, we then try to bridge the identified gaps, focusing in particular on multimedia resources. We focus on the two scenarios of music and picture resources and develop algorithms, which identify usage (theme) and opinion (mood) characteristics of the items. The mood and theme labels our algorithms infer are recommended to the users, in order to support them during the annotation process. The evaluation of the proposed methods against user judgements, as well as against expert ground truth reveal the high quality of our recommended annotations and provide insights into possible extensions for music and picture tagging systems to support retrieval. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Tag-clouds have become popular interfaces that allow users to query the database of these systems by clicking relevant terms. However, these single click queries are often not expressive enough to effectively retrieve the desired content. Users have to use multiple clicks or type longer queries to satisfy their information need. To enhance the predicted content ranking we use a random walk model that effectively integrates the user's preference and semantically related query terms. We use the collaborative annotations from a popular on-line book catalog to create a social annotation graph and study the effect of personalization and smoothing for increasing query lengths. We show that personalization and smoothing allow the user to find equally relevant content with fewer query terms compared to a frequency based content ranking with TF-IDF weighing. As expected, we see that the influence of the random walk model disappears if users type more detailed queries. Finally, we discuss the observations with respect to synonyms and homographs which are well known to hamper the performance of information retrieval systems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation. Experimental results using 100 concept categories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract        = {The Games With A Purpose (GWAP) genre is a type of Human Computation that outsources certain steps of the computational process to humans. By taking advantage of people's desire to be entertained, GWAP attracts people to play voluntarily, and also produce useful metadata as a by-product. The games have shown promise in solving a variety of problems, which computer computation has been unable to resolve completely thus far. In this paper, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of GWAP systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of GWAP systems. We argue that it is important for GWAP systems to implement proper puzzle selection strategies in order to collect human intelligence in a more efficient manner. Therefore, based on our analysis, we implement an Optimal Puzzle Selection Strategy (OPSA) to improve GWAP systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed OPSA approach can effectively improve the system gain of GWAP systems, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging services (folksonomies) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era. They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

To date, the interplay of the social and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.

However, information or content navigation support through taxonomy is often constrained due to its inability to take into account the full nomenclature and cultural nuances of knowledge seekers. The emergence and increasing adoption of collaborative tagging (social bookmarking) tools have provided lightweight and informal conceptual structures called folksonomies for knowledge retrieval. As for folksonomies, they reflect the vocabulary of the users. Hence, integrating folksonomies into a taxonomy combines the best of the two schemes as the resultant structure enhances taxonomy navigation with personsalisation for knowledge search and retrieval. This paper presents TaxoFolk, an algorithm for deriving hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy classification for enhanced knowledge navigation. The algorithm integrates folksonomy with a taxonomy through several unsupervised data mining techniques with augmented heuristics. © 2010 Operational Research Society. All rights reserved.},

The collection of these annotations and the way they connect users and resources produce a rich information space for users to explore. However the size, complexity and chaotic structure of these systems hamper users as they search for information. Recommenders can assist the user by suggesting resources, tags or even other users. Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions. Information channels can be used to explain the effectiveness of individual recommenders or explain the relative contribution of components in the hybrid recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages.

Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Such systems can be represented as graphs where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the problem of computing a ranking of users with respect to a facet described as a set of tags. A straightforward solution is to compute a PageRank-like algorithm on a facet-related graph, but it is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on the graph analysis of YouTube and Flickr, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results with two gold standards. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract        = {Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as a primary means for storing and sharing data among friends, family, colleagues, or perfect strangers as long as they have common interests. del.icio.us3 is a social network where people store and share their personal bookmarks. Most importantly, users tag their bookmarks for ease of information dissemination and later look up. However, it is the friendship links, that make del.icio.us a social network. They exist independently of the set of bookmarks that belong to the users and have no relation to the tags typically assigned to the bookmarks. To study the interaction among users, the strength of the existing links and their hidden meaning, we introduce implicit links in the network. These links connect only highly "similar " users. Here, similarity can reeflect different aspects of the user's profile that makes her similar to any other user, such as number of shared bookmarks, or similarity of their tags clouds. The authors investigate the question whether friends have common interests, they gain additional insights on the strategies that users use to assign tags to their bookmarks, and they demonstrate that the graphs formed by implicit links have unique properties differing from binomial random graphs or random graphs with an expected power-law degree distribution. © 2010, IGI Global.},

  abstract        = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general framework that incorporates collaborative social tagging with a novel ontology scheme conveying multiple perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a framework where multiple users tag the same object (an image in this case) and an ontology is extended based on these tags while being tolerant of different points of view. Both the tagging and the ontological models are intentionally designed to suit the multi-perspective environment. The paper develops a method based on a set of rules that determine how to associate new concepts to predefined perspectives (in addition to determining relations to topics or other concepts as typically done in previous research) and how to insert and maintain multiple perspectives. Findings - This case study experiment, with a set of selected annotated images, indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model. Originality/value - The proposed framework characterises the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development of a multi-perspective ontology and its application to improve image annotation, searching and browsing. The significance of this research is that it focuses on exploring the impact of creating a constantly evolving ontology based on collaborative tagging. The paper is not aware of any other work that has attempted to devise such an environment and to study its dynamics. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

  abstract        = {Taxonomy construction is a resource-demanding, top-down, and time consuming effort. It does not always cater for the prevailing context of the captured information. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically convert tags into a hierarchical taxonomy. Folksonomy describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords or tags to shared content. Using folksonomy as a knowledge source for nominating tags, the proposed method first converts the tags into a hierarchy. This serves to harness a core set of taxonomy terms; the generated hierarchical structure facilitates users' information navigation behavior and permits personalizations. Newly acquired tags are then progressively integrated into a taxonomy in a largely automated way to complete the taxonomy creation process. Common taxonomy construction techniques are based on 3 main approaches: clustering, lexico-syntactic pattern matching, and automatic acquisition from machine-readable dictionaries. In contrast to these prevailing approaches, this paper proposes a taxonomy construction analysis based on heuristic rules and deep syntactic analysis. The proposed method requires only a relatively small corpus to create a preliminary taxonomy. The approach has been evaluated using an expert-defined taxonomy in the environmental protection domain and encouraging results were yielded. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {All computer software systems, whether online or offline, require a help system. Help texts are traditionally written by software development companies and answer targeted questions in the form of how-tos and troubleshooting procedures. However, when the popularity of an application grows, users of the application themselves start adding to the corpus of help for the system in the form of online tutorials. There is, however, one problem with such tutorials. They have no direct link with the software for which they are written. Users have to search the Internet for different tutorials that are usually hosted on dispersed locations, and there is no ideal way of finding the relevant information without ending up with lots of noise in the search results. In this chapter, we describe a model for a help system which enhances this concept using collaborative tagging for categorization of “helplets.” For the knowledge retrieval part of the system, we utilize a previously developed technique based on common sense and user personalization. We use a freely available common sense reasoning toolkit for knowledge retrieval. Our architecture can be implemented in Web-based systems as well as in stand-alone desktop applications. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. Firstly, an expert should possess a high quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it. Secondly, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users do. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (SPamming-resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking), which implements these ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. We evaluate our method with experiments on data sets collected from Delicious.com comprising over 71,000 Web documents, 0.5 million users and 2 million shared bookmarks. We also show that the algorithm is more resistant to spammers than other methods such as the original HITS algorithm and simple statistical measures. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.

Two documents that are maintained in the collection of the same user and/or assigned similar sets of tags can be considered as related from the perspective of the user, even though they may not be connected by hyperlinks. We call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents. We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks. This study suggests that by studying the collective behaviour of users we are able to enhance navigation and organisation of Web documents. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

An important element of collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes a set of tags to each newly posted resource. In this paper we discuss the potential role of three tag sources: resource content as well as resource and user profiles in the tag recommendation system. Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for "content-based" and "graph-based" recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively.},

Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only in the internal characteristics related to Web service description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment. The success of Del.icio.us1, Flickr2, CiteULike3 and Connotea4 convinces us that collaborative tagging system is not only helpful in sharing and classifying Web resources but also can enhance the Web service discovery process. Without affecting actual Web 2.0 users' habit, we illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery (CoTE-WeD) allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. The system implementing our environment proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keyword-based and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed using WordNet 5 in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords.},

  abstract        = {The continuous growth of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing made possible the passage from an 'elitary' Web, written by few and read by many, towards the so-called Web 2.0, a more 'user-centric' vision, where users become active contributors in Web dynamics. In this context, collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging: in these platforms users can annotate resources they like with freely chosen keyword (called tags) in order to make retrieval of information and serendipitous browsing more and more easier. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems (called tag recommenders) is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated by exploiting different approaches. In this paper we present a tag recommender developed for the ECML-PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge. Our approach is based on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources.

The current study aims to study how the intra-personal consistency of tagging can be improved by proper tag visualization. The effects of visualization of tag frequency and visualization of the relevancy among tags on personal tagging consistency are empirically tested and compared through an experiment with 39 participants. The results show that visualization of tag relevancy improves tagging consistency significantly and reduces mental workload simultaneously; visualization of tag frequency may alleviate perceived physical demand when tag relevancy is visualized.

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to use their own words to describe their favourite resources, resulting in some user-generated categorisation schemes commonly known as folksonomies. Folksonomies thus contain rich information about the interests of the users, which can be used to support various recommender systems. Our analysis of the folksonomy in Delicious reveals that the interests of a single user can be very diverse. Traditional methods for representing interests of users are usually not able to reflect such diversity. We propose a method to construct user profiles of multiple interests from folksonomies based on a network clustering technique. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is able to generate user profiles which reflect the diversity of user interests and can be used as a basis of providing more focused recommendation to the users. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Recent research has shown that depending on the number of users and the quality of user-provided tags powerful community-driven semantics or "ontologies" can emerge - as it was evident analyzing user data from social web applications such as del.icio.us or Flickr. Unfortunately, most web pages do not contain tags and, thus, no vocabulary that describes the information provided. A common problem in web page annotation is to motivate users for constant participation, i.e. tagging.

A modified version of the Okapi BM25 IR model over users' tags is implemented on our third approach to form the user neighborhood.

Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

  abstract      = {Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments.

Most popular online social networking sites harness tag for managing and locating contents, for organizing and connecting users, and for recommending and sharing resources. We believe that tag acts like bridge between people and resources. Research on tag and tagging behavior will provide us insight about resource space and user activities on the Internet. In this paper, we present a two-level analysis of the tagging system of Del.icio.us. The results from both two levels confirm each other. In network level, we connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a social network of tags. By investigating its network feature, we find phenomena of small world and scale-free network. We also discover that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness. In individual level, users' tagging behaviors and patterns are observed by visualizing their bookmarking history on Del.icio.us. Besides, we study the linked users by their tags and find that users within a subscription network share more common interests than random pairs of users. During the analysis, we also discuss the implications of the findings for the design of tag-based system. © 2009 ACM.},

CiteULike is a so-called folksonomy where users have the possibility to organize publications through annotations - tags. Making reliable recommendations during the initial phase of a folksonomy is a difficult task, since information about user preferences is meager. In order to improve recommendation results during this cold start period, we present a probabilistic approach to item recommendation. Our model extends previously proposed models such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) by merging both user-item as well as item-tag observations into a unified representation. We find that bringing tags into play reduces the risk of overfitting and increases overall recommendation quality. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other types of recommenders.

The presence of tags, which uncover the reasons of user interests to tagged items, opens a way to increase the quality of recommendations. Yet, there is no common agreement of how the power of tags can be harnessed for recommendation. In this paper we argue for the use of spreading activation approach for building tag-aware recommender systems and suggest a specific version of this approach adapted to the multidimensional nature of social tagging networks. We introduce the asymmetric measure of relevancy (proximity) of two nodes on a multidimensional network as a cumulative strength of (weighted) multiple connections between two nodes, which includes paths and graph-structures connecting the nodes. This metric is also applicable to measure relevancy of two sub-graphs. Spreading activation methods (SAM), which usually employ breadth first search, are an efficient way to define and compute such measure taking into account not only links constituent a path, but the properties of nodes in the path such as node's types and outdegree. We apply this notion of relevancy to measure similarity of collaborative tagging systems users and present the results of numerical simulation showing that spreading activation methods allow us to discriminate between diverse graph-structures connecting users via resources and tags. We show that the results of simulation are stable w.r.t. the variation of parameters of spreading activation algorithm used in our experiment.},

More specifically, we discuss five properties of social tagging and their applications: 1) keyword property, which means social annotations serve as human selected keywords for Web resources; 2) semantic property, which indicates semantic relations among tags and Web resources; 3) hierarchical property, which means that hierarchical structure can be derived from the flat social tagging space; 4) quality property, which means that Web resources' qualities are varied and can be quantified using social tagging; 5) distribution property, which indicates the distribution of frequencies of social tags usually converges to a power-law distribution. These properties are the most principle characteristics, which have been popularly discussed and explored in many applications. As a case study, we show how to improve the social resource browsing by applying the five properties of social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

The two classical approaches, namely Content-based filtering (CB) and Collaborative filtering (CF), can be used in conjunction with each other to get benefit from both content analysis and user feedback. This paper introduces a system, called GlobalMusic2one that implements a novel approach to hybrid music search by combining methods of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Web 2.0 techniques to reach a new quality in recommending and distributing global music collections. To be able to classify these collections and to determine relationships between them, textual descriptions are gathered by collaborative tagging and statistical Web document analysis, as relevant documents in the Web may contain a lot of freely accessible and descriptive information on music content. The resulting text corpus can be used to identify connected entities, e.g. which artist is connected or similar to another artist. Therefore, this approach sensibly complements CB and CF techniques and has already been successfully implemented in the interactive music search system NIMS, which will be introduced as well.},

We present Gossple 1, a new, user-centric, approach to improve the exploration of the Internet. Underlying Gossple lies the intuition that while social networks provides news from your old buddies, you can learn a lot more from people you don't know, but with whom you share many (tagging) interests. More specifically, considering a collaborative tagging system with active taggers annotating content, Gossple expands the search query, of any user u, with tags that are considered "close" enough with respect to users that are "close" to u. Gossple users create their own network of social acquaintances in a gossip-based manner, by dynamically computing the estimation of a distance between taggers, based on cosine similarity between tags and items. These connections are used to feed a TagMap: our central abstraction that captures the personalised relationships between tags. The TagMap is then used by Gossple to meaningfully expand queries leveraging the personalised network. This is achieved through the TagRank algorithm, an adaptation of the celebrated pagerank algorithm, which automatically determines which tags best expand a list of tags in a given query. Gossple has no central authority: every user stores its own items and its tagging behaviour is stored only by its neighbours. The resulting networks are live, dynamic and do not require any underlying structure. We report on our evaluation of Gossple with CiteUlike traces, involving 33, 834 users. In short, we show that, with little information stored at every peer, Gossple enables to retrieve items that cannot be retrieved with state of the art search systems (complete- ness).Copyright 2009 ACM.},

The problem we address in this paper is the support of human interactions in SOA. Current collaboration tools do not support humans to specify different interaction interfaces (services), which can be reused in various collaborations. We focus on the design of Human-provided Services (HPS). Our contributions center around two main aspects of human interactions in SOA: (i) an approach for designing service interfaces embodying human activities as actions offered by Web (HPS) users; (ii) a tagging model for activities and services to recommend resources in the design process. We discuss techniques for mapping human activities onto Web services. We present a recommendation algorithm that is based on collaborative tagging of resources in SOA. Our algorithm helps to determine suitable resources drawn from properties of user preferences and measured similarity of human activities and actions. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper we investigate the ways to support semantic understanding of collaborative tags and propose an improved visualization named TagClusters. Based on the semantic analysis of the collaborative tags in Last.fm, the semantic similar tags are clustered into different groups and the visual distance represents the semantic similarity between tags, and thus the visualization offers a better semantic understanding of collaborative tags. A comparative evaluation is conducted with TagClouds and TagClusters based on the same tags collection.

  abstract      = {Nowadays, the most dominant and noteworthy web information sources are developed according to the collaborative-web paradigm, also known as Web 2.0. In particular, it represents a novel paradigm in the way users interact with the web. Users (also called prosumers) are no longer passive consumers of published content, but become involved, implicitly and explicitly, as they cooperate by providing their own resources in an "architecture of participation". In this scenario, collaborative tagging, i.e., the process of classifying shared resources by using keywords, becomes more and more popular. The main problem in such task is related to well-known linguistic phenomena, such as polysemy and synonymy, making effective content retrieval harder. In this paper, an approach that monitors users activity in a tagging system and dynamically quantifies associations among tags is presented. The associations are then used to create tags clusters. Experiments are performed comparing the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art tag clustering technique. Results -given in terms of classical precision and recall- show that the approach is quite effective in the presence of strongly related tags in a cluster. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

Movies, are becoming increasingly important, due to the proliferation of general queries on those sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address those queries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy, item-based or user-based, one of the key concerns in producing recommendations, is over-specialization, which results in returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processing returned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (e.g., genre and actors for movies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are not available (e.g., URLs in del.icio.us). In a recent paper [20], we introduced the notion of explanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise between accuracy and diversity. In this paper, we develop efficient diversification algorithms built upon this notion. The algorithms explore compromises between accuracy and diversity. We demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in diversification on two real life data sets: del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

This drawback has created the need for ontological structures which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations for translating and integrating the different sources.

First, we study the formation of stable distributions in tagging systems, seen as an implicit form of “consensus” reached by the users of the system around the tags that best describe a resource. We show that final tag frequencies for most resources converge to power law distributions and we propose an empirical method to examine the dynamics of the convergence process, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The convergence analysis is performed for both the most utilized tags at the top of tag distributions and the so-called long tail. Second, we study the information structures that emerge from collaborative tagging, namely tag correlation (or folksonomy) graphs.We show how community-based network techniques can be used to extract simple tag vocabularies from the tag correlation graphs by partitioning them into subsets of related tags. Furthermore, we also show, for a specialized domain, that shared vocabularies produced by collaborative tagging are richer than the vocabularies which can be extracted from large-scale query logs provided by a major search engine. © 2009, ACM.

This paper proposes a novel tag-based collaborative filtering approach for recommending personalized items to users of online communities that are equipped with tagging facilities. Based on the distinctive three dimensional relationships among users, tags and items, a new similarity measure method is proposed to generate the neighborhood of users with similar tagging behavior instead of similar implicit ratings. The promising experiment result shows that by using the tagging information the proposed approach outperforms the standard user and item based collaborative filtering approaches. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we propose Collaborative Wiki Tagging based on the idea to exploit inherent semantics of the concept of link in a wiki. The low-level integration of wiki and collaborative tagging of web resources is expected to be effective in enterprise environments particularly in the personal and group knowledge management application area. We first introduce a conceptualization of Collaborative Wiki Tagging. Then, we propose a simple scheme for using one of the existing native wiki syntax to represent tagging data. Collaborative Wiki Tagging Portal Prototype, developed as a proof of concept, is used to give illustrative practical examples of the proposed approach and illustration of the user interface. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Rather than following a collaborative filtering or annotation-based approach to recommendation, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) approach and present a unified recommendation model which evolves from item user and item tag co-occurrences in parallel. The inclusion of tags reduces known collaborative filtering problems related to overfitting and allows for higher quality recommendations. Experimental results on a large snapshot of the delicious bookmarking service show the scalability of our approach and an improved recommendation quality compared to two-mode collaborative or annotation based methods.Copyright 2009 ACM.},

These systems can be represented as tagged-graphs, where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the online computation of user-rankings associated to a set of tags, called a facet. A simple approach to faceted ranking is to apply an algorithm that calculates a measure of node centrality, say, PageRank, to a subgraph associated with the given facet. This solution, however, is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative solution: (i) first, a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) then, a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on empirical observations, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results to those produced by the direct calculation .},

In this paper several approaches to generate tag recommendations are discussed, and a prototypical recommender system for the social resource sharing platform ALOE is presented. This interactive system allows users to control the generation of the recommendations by selecting the sources to be used as well as their impact. The component was introduced at DFKI, and a first evaluation showed that the recommender component was considered as helpful by a majority of users. © J.UCS.},

However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We propose the utilization of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicates that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we aim at finding informative usage patterns from tags by consistent clustering on tags using nonnegative matrix factorization. The clustered subjects, represented by weighed tag vectors, can then be used to build a subjectcentered user information seeking model for item recommendation. Experiments on two realworld datasets show that our subject-based algorithms substantially outperform the traditional CF methods as well as tag-enhanced recommendation approaches reported in the literature.},

We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

Yet, optimizing for a large number of users, they usually provide good answers only to "most of us", and have yet to provide satisfying mechanisms to search for audiovisual content. In this talk I will present some ongoing work at L3S addressing these challenges, done in the context of several European Union funded projects on personal information management and web search. Regarding personalization, I will talk about personalizing Web Search based on user content, which goes beyond simple user profiles used in other systems. The algorithms presented improve Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user's personal information repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. Generating the additional query keywords is done by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Extensive empirical analysis shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Regarding search for audiovisual content, I will focus on exploiting user generated information, and discuss what kinds of tags are used for different resources and how they can help for search. Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. I will present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for different kinds of resources - Web pages, music, and images. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

  abstract        = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linking of a folksonomy (user vocabulary) and LCSH (controlled vocabulary) on the basis of word matching, for the potential use of LCSH in bringing order to folksonomies. Design/methodology/approach A selected sample of a folksonomy from a popular collaborative tagging system, Delicious, was wordmatched with LCSH. LCSH was transformed into a tree structure called an LCSH tree for the matching. A close examination was conducted on the characteristics of folksonomies, the overlap of folksonomies with LCSH, and the distribution of folksonomies over the LCSH tree. Findings The experimental results showed that the total proportion of tags being matched with LC subject headings constituted approximately twothirds of all tags involved, with an additional 10 percent of the remaining tags having potential matches. A number of barriers for the linking as well as two areas in need of improving the matching are identified and described. Three important tag distribution patterns over the LCSH tree were identified and supported: skewedness, multifacet, and Zipfianpattern. Research limitations/implications The results of the study can be adopted for the development of innovative methods of mapping between folksonomy and LCSH, which directly contributes to effective access and retrieval of tagged web resources and to the integration of multiple information repositories based on the two vocabularies. Practical implications The linking of controlled vocabularies can be applicable to enhance information retrieval capability within collaborative tagging systems as well as across various tagging system information depositories and bibliographic databases. Originality/value This is among frontier works that examines the potential of linking a folksonomy, extracted from a collaborative tagging system, to an authoritymaintained subject heading system. It provides exploratory data to support further advanced mapping methods for linking the two vocabularies. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging, supported by many social networking websites, is currently enjoying an increasing popularity. The usefulness of this largely available tag data has been explored in many applications including web resources categorization,deriving emergent semantics, web search etc. However, since tags are supplied by users freely, not all of them are useful and reliable, especially when they are generated by spammers with malicious intent. Therefore, identifying tags of high quality is crucial in improving the performance of applications based on tags. In this paper, we propose TRP-Rank (Tag-Resource Pair Rank), an algorithm to measure the quality of tags by manually assessing a seed set and propagating the quality through a graph. The three dimensional relationship among users, tags and web resources is firstly represented by a graph structure. A set of seed nodes, where each node represents a tag annotating a resource, is then selected and their quality is assessed. The quality of the remaining nodes is calculated by propagating the known quality of the seeds through the graph structure. We evaluate our approach on a public data set where tags generated by suspicious spammers were manually labelled. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in measuring the quality of tags. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Many attempts are being made to investigate user interactions by analyzing social networks among users. However, analyzing a social network with attributional data is often not an easy task because numerous ways exist to define features through aggregation of different tables. In this study, we propose an algorithm to identify important network-based features systematically from a given social network to analyze user behavior efficiently and to expand the services. We apply our method for link-based classification and link prediction tasks with two different datasets, i.e., an @cosme (an online viral marketing site) dataset and a Hatena Bookmark (collaborative tagging service) dataset, to demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm. Our algorithm is general and can provide useful network-based features for social network analyses. Copyright © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

  abstract        = {This research paper reports part of a larger international study that employs collaborative tagging for effectively describing knowledge and learning resources (KLR) in an institutionalised setting. The number of these resources has increased enormously within organisations over time and with an increasing variety of quality standards, maturity and granularity of resources, the description of content with metadata becomes more and more challenging. Automatic extraction services and professional metadata authoring tools could not deliver the expected results. Therefore, this research project investigated and discussed collaborative tagging as a means to successfully tag KLR. This paper presents results of an online survey distributed to first-year Information Systems students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The results report on the study's key themes of commitment and convergence towards generally accepted collaborative tags. Commitment and convergence could be confirmed, but there is a need for further exploration with a higher number of participants. Collaborative tagging is suggested as a solution to facilitate the development of ontologies for describing organisational metadata. © 2008 Ronald Maier, Silke Retzer and Stefan Thalmann.},

In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers. Our results are supported by extensive experiments on del.icio.us datasets. © 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

Existing approaches are hampered by the complexity of underlying semantic service models and by the fact that they try to impose a technical vocabulary to users. This leads to what we call the service discovery gap. In this paper we envision an approach that allows users to query or browse services using free text tags, thus providing an interface in terms of the users' vocabulary instead of the service's vocabulary. Unlike simple keyword search, we envision tag clouds associated with services themselves as semantic descriptions carrying collaborative knowledge about the service that can be clustered hierarchically, forming lightweight "ontologies". Besides tag-based discovery only describing the service on a global view, we envision refined tags and refined search/discovery in terms of the concepts that are common to all current semantic service description models, i.e. input, output, and operation. We argue that Service matching can be achieved, by applying tag-cloud-based service similarity on the one hand and by clustering services using case based indexing and retrieval techniques on the other hand.},

Conventional tags, meaning freely created tags that are not associated with a structured ontology, are not naturally suited for collaborative processes, due to linguistic and grammatical variations, as well as human typing errors. Additionally, tags reflect personal views of the world by individual users, and are not normalised for synonymy, morphology or any other mapping. Our view is that the conventional approach provides very limited semantic value for collaboration. Moreover, in cases where there is some semantic value, automatically sharing semantics via computer manipulations is extremely problematic. This paper explores these problems by discussing approaches for collaborative tagging activities at a semantic level, and presenting conceptual models for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies. We present criteria for the comparison of existing tag ontologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in relation to these criteria.},

Collaborative tagging systems allow people to organize a set of resources of interest through unconstrained annotations based on free keywords commonly named tags. Suggestive tagging techniques support users in this organization process and have shown to be helpful also in fostering a quick convergence to a shared tag vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a tag recommender which relies on the content analysis of the resource to be tagged, as well as on the personal and collective tagging history. The main contribution of this work is a model which combines semantic content analysis methods with existing suggestive tagging techniques. The expected benefit is the improvement of the user experience in social bookmarking systems, and more generally in collaborative tagging systems.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

We discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search, comparing them with user queries posted to search engines as well as through a user survey. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags.

The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique.

  abstract        = {This paper presents an analysis of the correlation of annotated information unit (textual) tags and geographical identification metadata geotags. Despite the increased usage of geotagging in collaborative tagging systems, most current research focuses on textual tagging alone in solving the tag search problem. This may result in difficulties to search for precise and relevant information within the given tag space. For example, inconsistencies like polysemy, synonyms, and word inflections with plural forms complicate the tag search problem. Therefore, more work needs to be done to include geotag information with existing tagging information for analysis. In this paper, to make geotagging possible to be used in analysis with tagging, we prove that there is a strong correlation between tagging and geotagging information. Our approach uses tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity to determine inter-relationships among tags and geotags. From our initial experiments, we show that the power law is established between tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity: this means that tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity has a strong correlation and the correlation can be used to find more relevant tags in the tag space. The power law confirms that there is an increased relationship between tagging and geotagging and the increased relationship is scalable in size of tags and geotags. Also, using both geotagging and tagging information instead of only tagging, we show that the uncertainty between derived and actual similarities among tags is reduced. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

Content categorization and search in such situation offers challenging scenarios. The primary means of content categorization in such social services is folk-sonomy or collaborative tagging. During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model. The results of the study are analyzed and future directions along this path of research are presented.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays the Web represents a growing collection of an enormous amount of contents where the need for better ways to find and organize the available data is becoming a fundamental issue, in order to deal with information overload. Keyword based Web searches are actually the preferred mean to seek for contents related to a specific topic. Search engines and collaborative tagging systems make possible the search for information thanks to the association of descriptive keywords to Web resources. All of them show problems of inconsistency and consequent reduction of recall and precision of searches, due to polysemy, synonymy and in general all the different lexical forms that can be used to refer to a particular meaning. A possible way to face or at least reduce these problems is represented by the introduction of semantics to characterize the contents of Web resources: each resource is described by one or more concepts instead of simple and often ambiguous keywords. To support these task the availability of a global semantic resource of reference is fundamental. On the basis of our past experience with the semantic tagging of Web resources and the SemKey Project, we are developing Tagpedia, a general-domain "encyclopedia" of tags, semantically structured for generating semantic descriptions of contents over the Web, created by mining Wikipedia. In this paper, starting from an analysis of the weak points of non-semantic keyword based Web searches, we introduce our idea of semantic characterization of Web resources describing the structure and organization of Tagpedia. We introduce our first realization of Tagpedia, suggesting all the possible improvements that can be carried out in order to exploit its full potential.},

When users click on a tag included in the tag cloud while watching the video, the tag gets associated with the time point of the video. Users can share the information on the tags that have already been clicked. We confirmed that the coverage of annotations generated by this method is higher than that of the existing methods, and users are motivated to add tags by using tag-sharing and tag-cloud methods.

  abstract        = {Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one. © 2008 ACM.},

Contrary to most of current research we exclusively focus on the usage of RSS feeds for retrieval of tag-related data. Here we exploit "recent" feeds, as this method of data retrieval corresponds directly to the way users can retrieve data from these services, e.g. for tag suggestions. We motivate the preferred usage of feeds compared to full site grabbing, and present analysis results of feed data from a period of one month concerning feature distribution, growth, stability and convergence aspects. Furthermore we compare tag spaces and their intersections for potential interoperability and integration of these services, and reveal that tags in practice are not really as freely chosen as often promised.},

The objective of this research is to analyze the descriptors and tags from journal articles indexed in the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and the folksonomy-based website CiteULike to determine overlap between the controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies. Metadata from 2,786 journal articles indexed in ERIC and CiteULike was collected using Perl and MySQL. The total metadata was comprised of 2,899 unique ERIC descriptors, 3,176 unique CiteULike tags, and 1,083 unique CiteULike users. An analysis of this metadata revealed that 240 of the CiteULike tags matched ERIC descriptors. The low number of tag-descriptor matches in this research indicates that CiteULike users do not use the same terminology as subject specialists who maintain descriptors in the ERIC thesaurus.

  abstract        = {Recommender Systems (RS) aim at predicting items or ratings of items that the user are interested in. Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are "global" descriptions of items, tags are "local" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tagaware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three twodimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords - so called "tags" - to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {It is against the dynamically evolving nature of many contemporary media applications to be analysed in terms of conventional rigid ontologies that rely on expertise-based fixed categories and hierarchical structure. Many of these rely on sharing 'folksonomies', personal descriptions of information and objects for one's own retrieval. Such applications involve many feedback mechanisms via the community, and have been shown to have emergent properties of complex dynamic systems. We propose that such dynamically evolving information domains can be more usefully described by means of a soft ontology, a dynamically flexible and inherently spatial metadata approach for ill-defined domains. Our contribution is (1) the elaboration of the so far intuitive concept of soft ontology in a way that supports conceptualizing dynamically evolving domains. Further, our approach proposes (2) a whole new mode of interaction with information domains by means of recurring exploration of an information domain from multiple perspectives in search of more comprehensive understanding of it, i.e. multi-perspective exploration. We demonstrate this concept with an example of collaborative tagging in an educational context. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract        = {The popularity of collaborative tagging, otherwise known as "folksonomies", emanate from the flexibility they afford users in navigating large information spaces for resources, tags, or other users, unencumbered by a pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchy. Despite its advantages, social tagging also increases user overhead in search and navigation: users are free to apply any tag they wish to a resource, often resulting in a large number of tags that are redundant, ambiguous, or idiosyncratic. Data mining techniques such as clustering provide a means to overcome this problem by learning aggregate user models, and thus reducing noise. In this paper we propose a method to personalize search and navigation based on unsupervised hierarchical agglomerative tag clustering. Given a user profile, represented as a vector of tags, the learned tag clusters provide the nexus between the user and those resources that correspond more closely to the user's intent. We validate this assertion through extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Roughly, two lines of research have been pursued: (a) studying the structure of tags, and (b) using tag to promote Web search. However, both of them remain preliminary. Research reported in this paper is aimed at addressing some of these research gaps. First, we apply complex network theory to analyze various structural properties of collaborative tagging activities to gain a detailed understanding of user tagging behavior and also try to capture the mechanism that can help explain such tagging behavior. Second, we conduct a preliminary computational study to utilize tagging information to help improve the quality of Web page recommendation. The results indicate that under the user-based recommendation framework, tags can be fruitfully exploited as they facilitate better user similarity calculation and help reduce sparsity related to past user-Web page interactions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact. © 2008 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

In this paper we investigate the combination of collaborative tagging systems with visual tags. We present a prototype of a semiautomatic system generating visual tags which gather information from collaborative tagging. The user can interact with a list of relevant tags (built by clustering closely related tags) that can be further encoded in a visual tag, according to user's preferences. The user experience is enriched by retrieving multimedia content linked to the selected tags, present on the web.

Collaborative tagging shifts the creation of metadata for indexing web resources, from an individual professional activity to a collective endeavor, where every user is a potential contributor. In this paper we introduce an approach to knowledge evolution which aims to exploit the ability of collaborative tagging in fostering community members participation to move forward an initial knowledge structure.

An important step towards exploiting the possible synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy.

The results of this early study suggest that some tags are found as useful as thesaurus terms and that users are divided about the benefits of multilingual tags.

Tags are used for navigation finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we present two tag recommendation algorithms: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, an adaptation of the well-known PageRank algorithm that can cope with undirected triadic hyperedges. We evaluate and compare both algorithms on large-scale real life datasets and show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably.},

This paper proposes a spreading activation approach to predict social annotation based on document contents and users' tagging records. Total 28,792 mature documents selected from del.icio.us are taken as answer keys. The experimental results show that this approach predicts 71.28% of a 100 users' tag set with only 5 users' tagging records, and 84.76% of a 13-month tag set with only 1-month tagging record under the precision rates of 82.43% and 89.67%, respectively. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

With KeepUP, we outline the design of a recommendation process that is based on an implicit social network where the relevancy and meaning of information can be negotiated not only with the recommender system but also with other users.

As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation.

Indeed, expressing expert knowledge in a given formalism is a tedious process. Less structured annotations such as tagging have, however, proved immensely popular, whilst existing unstructured or semi-structured collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have proven to be useful and scalable. Both processes are often regulated through social mechanisms such as wiki-like operations, recommendations, ratings, and collaborative games. To promote collaborative tagging as a means to acquire unstructured as well as structured knowledge we introduce the notion of Extreme Tagging, which describes systems which allow the tagging of resources, as well as of tags themselves and their relations. We provide a formal description of extreme tagging followed by examples and highlight the necessity of regulatory processes which can be applied to it. We also present a prototype implementation.},

  abstract        = {When authors publish their interpretations of the ideas, opinions, claims or rebuttals in the literature, they are drawing on a repertoire of well understood moves, contributing to an extended discourse. Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

  abstract      = {A large part of the modern web is characterized by usergenerated content categorized using collaborative tagging or folksonomy. It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community web sites. © 2007 IEEE.},

We produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to understand the basic dynamics behind tagging, including how a power law distribution of tags could arise. We empirically examine the tagging history of sites in order to determine how this distribution arises over time and to determine the patterns prior to a stable distribution. Lastly, by focusing on the high-frequency tags of a site where the distribution of tags is a stabilized power law, we show how tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags can be used to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags.},

Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract        = {Folksonomies have the potential to add much value to public library catalogues by enabling clients to: store, maintain, and organize items of interest in the catalogue using their own tags. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the tags that constitute folksonomies are structured. Tags were acquired over a thirty-day period from the daily tag logs of three folksonomy sites, Del.icio.us, Furl, and Technorati. The tags were evaluated against section 6 (choice and form of terms) of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) guidelines for the construction of controlled vocabularies. This evaluation revealed that the folksonomy tags correspond closely to the NISO guidelines that pertain to the types of concepts expressed by the tags, the predominance of single tags, the predominance of nouns, and the use of recognized spelling. Potential problem areas in the structure of the tags pertain to the inconsistent use of the singular and plural form of count nouns, and the incidence of ambiguous tags in the form of homographs and unqualified abbreviations or acronyms. Should library catalogues decide to incorporate folksonomies, they could provide clear guidelines to address these noted weaknesses, as well as links to external dictionaries and references sources such as Wikipedia to help clients disambiguate homographs and to determine if the full or abbreviated forms of tags would be preferable.

We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology.

Using frequency data and co-word analysis matrices analyzed by multi-dimensional scaling, the authors discovered that tagging practices to some extent work in ways that are continuous with conventional indexing. Small numbers of tags tend to emerge by unspoken consensus, and inconsistencies follow several predictable patterns that can easily be anticipated. However, the tags also indicated intriguing practices relating to time and task which suggest the presence of an extra dimension in classification and organization, a dimension which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given URL. We also present a dynamic model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge. © CILIP.},

Users expect to be able to connect with information in ways that are different from what was typical in the early or pre-Internet world where people were restricted to playing the role of information consumer. This shift from passive consumption to active interaction has important implications in terms of information and knowledge management. These implications, particularly when applied to the work environment, have raised new challenges within information and knowledge management – challenges that are best addressed through the application of digital curation. Digital curation is a developing field within information science, situated at the intersection of information management, knowledge management, communication and technology. Digital curation work aims to add value and meaning to digital content. },

Publisher Summary This chapter introduces a few methodological remarks on the way the five heuristics relate to the design process and compares the move into ubiquitous ecologies as the move from 2D to 3D, which is described in Flatland. Pervasive information architectures thrive on the balance of a horizontal and vertical axis, which provide a uniquely tension between local precision and global imprecision for building successful cross-channel user experiences. The chapter also summarizes the key concept behind the idea of pervasive information architecture. If place-making is essential to making people stay and feel comfortable, and consistency, resilience, and reduction help people make sense of what they have around, correlation is the backbone of the horizontal axis, the one that conceptually makes the process one single, flowing layer.

Examples of types of business metadata that require special capture mechanisms from businesspeople are business terms, definitions of business terms, linking of business terms to the data elements of one or more systems, business rules, optimal ways of performing the job (“knowledge artifacts”; knowledge encyclopedia entries), and categorization (of business terms, documents, web pages, etc.). The chapter begins by discussing why knowledge capture is so important. Business metadata, after all, exists for businesspeople to use, and it should reflect their point of view. There has to be a way (and a place) to capture their perspective so that it can be accessed by other businesspeople. This chapter attempts to define what the corporate knowledge base really is and how it represents this business point of view. Following this, the discussion extends to encourage businesspeople to share their valuable insights and information and presents various technologies that can support knowledge capture. In addition, the chapter covers the subject of capturing knowledge from both individuals and groups or communities of users. The interesting aspect of metadata or knowledge capture from individuals is the ability of the individual to directly benefit from this exercise. A special kind of stewardship called “Governance Lite” which presents one way to balance the need for some governance with knowledge capture requirements is explored. In the process, this chapter investigates some of the unique features of the knowledge capture culture as it pertains to governance. The role of publicity in encouraging people to share their valuable knowledge is also discussed. Individual knowledge capture is revisited, and practical ideas are presented to help one be more productive in capturing one's moments of brilliance and insight so one can remember them later. },

For example, dramatic changes in work practices must have resulted from the introduction of the telephone.

Taken to its extreme, theoretically, all major decisions could be made by citizens effectively instantaneously, by online voting. The information technology that is the subject of this book is Web 2.0, which concerns the ability to share information on the web, for users, especially the general public, to collaborate. The significance of Web 2.0 is outlined, and the participation–collaboration pattern, the declarative living pattern and the tag gardening pattern are explained.

  abstract  = {Socially-constructed metadata provides a platform for two-way collaboration using current technologies such as tagging, user-reviews, recommendations and metadata crowdsourcing. This results in post-hoc metadata with each user contributing, via a network effect, to metadata diversity. However, standards-based, a priori, metadata restricts users’ involvement and ensures consistent structures and quality. These approaches though, are not necessarily in opposition. Combining both, into a mixed metadata system, unlocks the potential for metadata diversity and scalability whilst maintaining hierarchical and semantic structure. This changes the underlying principles for metadata systems, to consider variable user participation, aggregation and provenance, along with a change in the definition of quality so that it focuses on findability or usefulness. },

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This article focuses on Semantic Web, which is another important Web development, besides Web 2.0, that has emerged roughly since 2001. Tim Berners-Lee and others wrote in their famous paper “The Semantic Web—A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities” in the Scientific American that the Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data on the Web defined and linked in a way that it can be used by machines not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration, and reuse of data across various applications. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. A comparison of the features available through Web 2.0 technology, in particular, social bookmarking, tagging, and folksonomies, with Semantic Web developments such as taxonomies and ontologies, is presented. The possible augmentations and enhancements to traditional search engines and data integration are the core idea of the Semantic. A considerable number of techniques and approaches to deal with data integration problems, that fall in two basic categories: virtual integration and materialized integration. Materialized systems include search engines with their index, but also data warehouses as used in online analytical processing (OLAP) applications. Virtual systems include meta search engines such as Mamma, multidatabase systems as well as systems building on so called mediated integration. Languages at the core of Semantic Web development include \{RDF\} (the Resource Description Framework), \{RDF\} Schema (RDFS, a schema specification language), and \{OWL\} (Web Ontology Language). },

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to retrieve and extract service tags by leveraging information from the Internet. Our approach retrieves service related web pages by searching online for the URL of the services, then executes a Vector Space Model (VSM) based procedure to fulfill structure analysis and content extraction of the pages, finally mines service related tags together with WSDL documents. Experiments on real web services demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which is able to extract more number of abundant and meaningful tags.},

In radio productions, where multiple speakers' voices and music coexist, it is quite important to detect voice and music patterns, in order to achieve efficient classification of the audio content. Recent research confirmed that the process of audio feature extraction and selection is critical for the overall system performance. In the current work, the feature extraction procedure is applied in each audio channel of stereo radio programmes separately in order to exploit the differences of audio information between channels. Feature ranking algorithms are employed, aiming to investigate the saliency of the feature differences. The classification performance of the implemented artificial neural systems revealed that the stereo differences have to be taken into consideration during audio semantic analysis.},

Our algorithm can address the issues of spams, polysemes and synonyms more effectively and determine the relevance between the images and their social tags more precisely, thus it can allow us to create large amounts of training images with more reliable labels by harvesting from large-scale weakly-tagged images, which can further be used to achieve more effective classifier training for many computer vision tasks.},

Providing architecture for large-scale personalized peer to peer information retrieval, e. g. personalized searching of the ubiquitous environment is an appealing application for peer to peer systems. In this paper, we propose an adaptive architecture to structure peer to peer systems. An adaptive architecture for personalized information retrieval considering user's profile is important. We present the first architecture for personalized information retrieval in ubiquitous environment with peer-to-peer systems.

  abstract  = {Up to now, the problem of ensuring collaborative activities in e-Learning against dishonest students' behaviour has been mainly tackled with technological security solutions. Over the last years, technological security solutions have evolved from isolated security approaches based on specific properties, such as privacy, to holistic models based on technological security comprehensive solutions, such as public key infrastructures, biometric models and multidisciplinary approaches from different research areas. Current technological security solutions are feasible in many e-Learning scenarios but on-line assessment involves certain requirements that usually bear specific security challenges related to e-Learning design. In this context, even the most advanced and comprehensive technological security solutions cannot cope with the whole scope of e-Learning vulnerabilities. To overcome these deficiencies, our previous research aimed at incorporating information security properties and services into on-line collaborative e-Learning by a functional approach based on trustworthiness assessment and prediction. In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer on-line assessment approach carried out in a real on-line course developed in our real e-Learning context of the Open University of Catalonia. The design presented in this paper is conducted by our trustworthiness security methodology with the aim of building peer-to-peer collaborative activities, which enhances security e-Learning requirements. Eventually, peer-to-peer visualizations methods are proposed to manage security e-Learning events, as well as on-line visualization through peer-to-peer tools, intended to analyse collaborative relationship.},

In this context, e-Learning stakeholders, are increasingly demanding new requirements, among them, information security is considered as a critical factor involved in on-line collaborative processes. Information security determines the accurate development of learning activities, especially when a group of students carries out on-line assessment, which conducts to grades or certificates, in these cases, IS is an essential issue that has to be considered. To date, even most advances security technological solutions have drawbacks that impede the development of overall security e-Learning frameworks. For this reason, this paper suggests enhancing technological security models with functional approaches, namely, we propose a functional security model based on trustworthiness and collective intelligence. Both of these topics are closely related to on-line collaborative learning and on-line assessment models. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to discover how security can be enhanced with trustworthiness in an on-line collaborative learning scenario through the study of the collective intelligence processes that occur on on-line assessment activities. To this end, a peer-to-peer public student's profile model, based on trustworthiness is proposed, and the main collective intelligence processes involved in the collaborative on-line assessments activities, are presented.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community Web sites.},

The purpose of this study is to identify student's perception on using Facebook as a learning tool. Activity theory is adopted as a conceptual framework and analytical tool to demonstrate students' perceptions in using Facebook.

ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing relations between tags.},

However, obtaining labels in this manner poses two important challenges. First, naively labeling all of the data can be prohibitively expensive. Second, a significant fraction of the annotations can be incorrect due to carelessness or limited domain expertise of crowd sourced workers. Active learning provides a natural formulation to address the former issue by affordably selecting an appropriate subset of instances to label. Unfortunately, most active learning strategies are myopic and sensitive to label noise, which leads to poorly trained classifiers. We propose an active learning method that is specifically designed to be robust to such noise. We present an application of our technique in the domain of activity recognition for eldercare and validate the proposed approach using both simulated and real-world experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk.},

A technique called SCM/THD investigated in this paper extracts entities from free-text annotations, and using the Lin similarity measure over the WordNet thesaurus classifies them into a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hypernyms extracted from Wikipedia are used to map uncommon entities to Wordnet synsets. In collaborative environments, users can assign multiple annotations to the same object hence increasing the amount of information available. Assuming that the semantics of the annotations overlap, this redundancy can be exploited to generate higher quality tags. A preliminary experiment presented in the paper evaluates the consistency and quality of tags generated from multiple annotations of the same image. The results obtained on an experimental dataset comprising of 62 annotations from four annotators show that the accuracy of a simple majority vote surpasses the average accuracy obtained through assessing the annotations individually by 18%. A moderate-strength correlation has been found between the quality of generated tags and the consistency of annotations.},

CoScribe provides for a very seamless integration of paper with the digital world, as the same digital pen and the same interactions can be used on paper and displays. As our second contribution, we present empirical results of three field studies on learning at universities.

The resulting interaction design comprising collaboration support and multiuser visualizations has been implemented and evaluated in user studies.

  abstract  = {The configuration and runtime management of distributed systems is often complex due to the presence of a large number of configuration options and dependencies between interacting sub-systems. Inexperienced users usually choose default configurations because they are not aware of the possible configurations and/or their effect on the systems' operation. In doing so, they are unable to take advantage of the potentially wide range of system capabilities. Furthermore, managing inter-dependent sub-systems frequently involves performing a set of actions to get the overall system to the desired final state. In this paper, we propose a new approach for configuring and managing distributed systems based on AI planning. We use a goal-driven, tag-based user interaction paradigm to shield users from the complexities of configuring and managing systems. The key idea behind our approach is to package different configuration options and system management actions into reusable modules that can be automatically composed into workflows based on the user's goals. It also allows capturing the inter-dependencies between different configuration options, management actions and system states. We evaluate our approach in a case study involving three inter-dependent sub-systems. Our initial experiences indicate that this planning-based approach holds great promise in simplifying configuration and management tasks.},

Knowledge recommender system (KRS) is an efficient way to decrease information overload, and the user model is very critical for KRS. This paper proposes a method to establish a user model based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In detail, we first select the keywords from knowledge databases, and then represent knowledge items with Vector Space Model (VSM). Next, for a certain user, the VSM of all scanned knowledge items and related scores rated by the user are combined together to be a new matrix, named as Vector Space Model with Rating(VSMR,with dimension of m times n), where the first n-1 columns represent the VSM of the items, and the final column lists the scores given by the user. And then the GMM-based user model is trained with VSMR. Finally, the trained user model is used to predict the user's ratings on the knowledge items and the items with the higher score are considered as user's interest, which will be recommended to the user. The proposed method is validated by two experiments, which indicate that the method works well.},

We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.},

  abstract  = {Q&A social media have gained a lot of attention during the recent years. People rely on these sites to obtain information due to a number of advantages they offer as compared to conventional sources of knowledge (e.g., asynchronous and convenient access). However, for the same question one may find highly contradicting answers, causing an ambiguity with respect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/or non-expert users. These two attributes (reliability and expertise) significantly affect the quality of the answer/information provided. We present a novel approach for estimating these user's characteristics relying on human cognitive traits. In brief, we propose each user to monitor the activity of her peers (on the basis of responses to questions asked by her) and observe their compliance with predefined cognitive models. These observations lead to local assessments that can be further fused to obtain a reliability and expertise consensus for every other user in the social network (SN). For the aggregation part we use subjective logic. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of this kind in the context of Q&A SN. Our proposed approach is highly distributed; each user can individually estimate the expertise and the reliability of her peers using her direct interactions with them and our framework. The online SN (OSN), which can be considered as a distributed database, performs continuous data aggregation for users expertise and reliability assessment in order to reach a consensus. We emulate a Q&A SN to examine various performance aspects of our algorithm (e.g., convergence time, responsiveness etc.). Our evaluations indicate that it can accurately assess the reliability and the expertise of a user with a small number of samples and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change, provided that the cognitive traits hold in practice.},

As such services consume and generate a large amount of information, knowledge-sharing mechanisms are required to capture, transfer and reuse information across projects. So far, with the advent of the internet, the business community has mainly focused on web-based technologies for knowledge sharing. The most common approach is a web portal through which a practitioner can access the organization's collection of intellectual capital. This approach, however, has notable drawbacks. In particular, they often fail to stimulate active user participation, in terms of both contributing to and using the knowledge base. The problem, as we see it, is largely caused by the separation between the environment of a client engagement and that of knowledge management. In this paper, we propose a knowledge management system that is integrated into the process of delivering a client engagement. The integration is realized at two levels: at the content level, the knowledge is organized by a framework that is central to the client engagement at hand; at the tool level, the knowledge management system is embedded in the software for developing work products for a client engagement The advantages of the proposed integration over existing tools are discussed.},

In this paper, two aspects of cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated: One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then, Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.},

Several strategies have been employed to tackle this problem. With the coming of Web2.0, user-created data and sharing of information among peers, community-based tagging or folksonomy has become the norm for organization of data on the Internet. The loose structure of folksonomy has led to ease in categorization of the huge amounts of information but has also given rise to some serious problems. Users tag information based on their own experiences, preferences and common sense. This leads to difficulties in search and organization of information in the long run. In this paper, we argue that since user common sense has generated both folksonomy and a corpus of machine common sense, it seems appropriate that machine common sense be used for addressing the problem of search in folksonomy. We outline an architecture for such an operation, develop a prototype as a proof of concept and describe how this approach can be extended in the future.},

The cache management of the proposed caching scheme not only uses adaptively CacheData or CachePath based on data similarity and data utility, but also uses the replacement manager based on data profit. Also, the proposed caching scheme uses a prefetch manager. When the TTL of the cached data expires, the prefetch manager evaluates the popularity index of the data. If the popularity index is larger than a threshold, the data is prefetched. Otherwise, its space is released. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated analytically and is compared to that of other cooperative caching schemes.},

We describe the simple mechanism for deriving tag suggestions and the ensuing interaction design for presenting these suggestions to the user. We also discuss quantitative and qualitative results from an 18-months deployment of ZoneTag, emphasizing the way people use and understand tag suggestions. In addition, we highlight several emerging issues that could play an important role in the collaborative tagging for multimedia as well as other resources. While the quantitative study on the use of the suggested tags feature implies clear benefits for tag suggestions, a set of qualitative studies imply that while tag suggestions are helpful, there are multiple issues that arise and require careful consideration.},

  abstract  = {Tagging technique is widely used to annotate objects in Web 2.0 applications. Tags can support web service understanding, categorizing and discovering, which are important tasks in a service-oriented software system. However, most of existing web services' tags are annotated manually. Manual tagging is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tag web services automatically. Our approach consists of two tagging strategies, tag enriching and tag extraction. In the first strategy, we cluster web services using WSDL documents, and then we enrich tags for a service with the tags of other services in the same cluster. Considering our approach may not generate enough tags by tag enriching, we also extract tags from WSDL documents and related descriptions in the second step. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, a series of experiments are carried out based on web-scale web services. The experimental results show that our tagging method is effective, ensuring the number and quality of generated tags. We also show how to use tagging results to improve the performance of a web service search engine, which can prove that our work in this paper is useful and meaningful.},

Taking advantage of the repetitive nature of modern information and online media databases with independent annotation instances, we present an approach to automatically annotate multimedia documents that uses mining techniques to discover new annotations from similar documents and to filter existing incorrect annotations. The annotation set is not limited to words that have training data or for which models have been created. It is limited only by the words in the collective annotation vocabulary of all the database documents. A graph reinforcement method driven by a particular modality (e.g., visual) is used to determine the contribution of a similar document to the annotation target. The graph supplies possible annotations of a different modality (e.g., text) that can be mined for annotations of the target. Experiments are performed using videos crawled from YouTube. A customized precision-recall metric shows that the annotations obtained using the proposed method are superior to those originally existing for the document. These extended, filtered tags are also superior to a state-of-the-art semi-supervised technique for graph reinforcement learning on the initial user-supplied annotations.},

In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities. We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},

  abstract = {Social TV is a social media service via TV and social networks through which TV users exchange their experiences about TV programs that they are viewing. For social TV service, two technical aspects are envisioned: grouping of similar TV users to create social TV communities and recommending TV programs based on group and personal interests for personalizing TV. In this paper, we propose a unified topic model based on grouping of similar TV users and recommending TV programs as a social TV service. The proposed unified topic model employs two latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models. One is a topic model of TV users, and the other is a topic model of the description words for viewed TV programs. The two LDA models are then integrated via a topic proportion parameter for TV programs, which enforces the grouping of similar TV users and associated description words for watched TV programs at the same time in a unified topic modeling framework. The unified model identifies the semantic relation between TV user groups and TV program description word groups so that more meaningful TV program recommendations can be made. The unified topic model also overcomes an item ramp-up problem such that new TV programs can be reliably recommended to TV users. Furthermore, from the topic model of TV users, TV users with similar tastes can be grouped as topics, which can then be recommended as social TV communities. To verify our proposed method of unified topic-modeling-based TV user grouping and TV program recommendation for social TV services, in our experiments, we used real TV viewing history data and electronic program guide data from a seven-month period collected by a TV poll agency. The experimental results show that the proposed unified topic model yields an average 81.4% precision for 50 topics in TV program recommendation and its performance is an average of 6.5% higher than that of the topic model of TV users only. For TV user prediction with new TV programs, the average - rediction precision was 79.6%. Also, we showed the superiority of our proposed model in terms of both topic modeling performance and recommendation performance compared to two related topic models such as polylingual topic model and bilingual topic model.},

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to assess the learners' understandings. The mentioned method which is named TagAssessment computes the figure of relationship between the contents and the user's tags and utilizes the obtained results for learner assessment. In this regard, the semantic distance between the tags associated to the content, and the concepts covered by the same content is calculated using WordNet tree ontology. In the evaluation process, ninety learners were asked to place their tags on the contents related to a BSc course to create a data set for further evaluation. The obtained results showed that as the smaller the distance between the learners' tags and the contents are the better comprehension have been achieved.},

To deal with the problem, numerous approaches employed semantic techniques in terms of annotation (or tagging) and service discovery algorithms. However, the problem of semantic service discovery based on the identification of fine-grained goals of users and services is still challenging due to the lack of semantic information in Web services. To enable the goal-driven semantic service discovery, we propose an automatic functional-goals tagging approach which employs a set of natural language processing (NLP) procedures based on the descriptions of Web services. In addition, to check the effectiveness of the functional-goals tagged, we designed a goal-driven semantic service discovery algorithm and compared it with other approaches: keyword-based, ontology-based, and topic-based service discovery. As results, our proposed goal-driven semantic service discovery achieved 75.7% of precision and 59.6% of recall (finally, F1=62%) that outperform other discovery approaches.},

The manual screening of biomedical literature is an important task in the process of systematic reviews. Researchers and curators have the very demanding, time-consuming, and error-prone task of manually identifying documents that should be included in a systematic review concerning a specific problem. We developed a supervised learning approach to support screening tasks, by automatically flagging potentially relevant documents from a list retrieved by a literature database search. To overcome the main issues associated with the automatic literature screening task, we evaluated the use of data sampling, feature combinations, and feature selection methods, generating a total of 105 classification models. The models yielding the best results were composed of a Logistic Model Trees classifier, a fairly balanced training set, and feature combination of Bag-Of-Words and MeSH terms.

Service discovery based on semantics of web services is one of the main needs in service integration and composition. The main current approaches for semantic discovery of services are the keyword-based approach and the ontology-based approach. The plain simple keyword matching strategy is time-consuming and has inefficient recall and precision. The ontology-based strategy, on the other hand, is efficient, but may not be practical for the wide public use due to the lack of domain experts. In this paper, we propose a new approach that support semantic service discovery and service backing up in case of service unavailability. This approach is built using the FCA ( Formal concept analysis ) lattices and the WordNet.},

Such dependencies provide meaningful information concerning the overall system dynamics and should be explicitly integrated into the burst detection process. Using both synthetic scenarios and two real-world datasets, we compare our method with an existing burst-detection algorithm.

Automatic enforcement allows us to extend the protection of content for unprotected files, preventing underage viewers from accessing adult content, tracking stolen or misused copyright-free images. This work builds upon the notion of `Web-Traveler policies', previously introduced as a new class of content control policies.

Under the considered setting, the task is for all the nodes, after receiving any new chunk of training data, to agree on a single classifier in a decentralized fashion, without reliance on a master node. In particular, in this paper we propose a fully decentralized, sequential learning algorithm for a class of neural networks known as Random Vector Functional-Link nets. The proposed algorithm does not require the presence of a single coordinating agent, and it is formulated exclusively in term of local exchanges between neighboring nodes, thus making it useful in a wide range of realistic situations. Experimental simulations on four music classification benchmarks show that the algorithm has comparable performance with respect to a centralized solution, where a single agent collects all the local data from every node and subsequently updates the model.},

We show that tag ordering, which has been largely overlooked by the image tagging community, is an important cue in understanding user tagging behavior and can be used to improve auto-tagging systems. Inspired by the assumption that people order their tags, we propose a new way of measuring tag preferences, and also propose a new personalized tagging objective function that explicitly considers a user's preferred tag orderings. We also provide a (partially) greedy algorithm that produces good solutions to our new objective and under certain conditions produces an optimal solution. We validate our method on a subset of Flickr images that spans 5000 users, over 5200 tags, and over 90,000 images. Our experiments show that exploiting personalized tag orders improves the average performance of state-of-art approaches both on per-image and per-user bases.},

With the growth of the Web, human computation systems can now leverage the abilities of an unprecedented number of people via the Web to perform complex computation. There are various genres of human computation applications that exist today. Games with a purpose (e.g., the ESP Game) specifically target online gamers who generate useful data (e.g., image tags) while playing an enjoyable game. Crowdsourcing marketplaces (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) are human computation systems that coordinate workers to perform tasks in exchange for monetary rewards. In identity verification tasks, users perform computation in order to gain access to some online content; an example is reCAPTCHA, which leverages millions of users who solve CAPTCHAs every day to correct words in books that ptical character recognition (OCR) programs fail to recognize with certainty. This book is aimed at achieving four goals: (1) defining human computation as a research area; (2) providing a comprehensive review of existing work; (3) drawing connections to a wide variety of disciplines, including AI, Machine Learning, HCI, Mechanism/Market Design and Psychology, and capturing their unique perspectives on the core research questions in human computation; and (4) suggesting promising research directions for the future.

The availability of (open) data from the PA and third party organizations, which can be made public and widely accessible, introduces a significant paradigm shift from citizen-centric to citizen-driven eGovernment. In this direction, the mashup model (for client-side composition), with the ability to use widespread and relatively simple Web technologies, seems to be a viable approach for simplifying service creation. To ensure an adequate penetration of this new way of service offering, social-aware service discovery techniques assume a crucial role. In the paper, we propose a recommender that offers, in addition to the conventional search techniques, some support for context- aware implicit search of services, based on social information. The ability to leverage the data characterizing the activity of users in the network easies service selection: social relationships and the potential behavioral similarities between people, or in general among users linked by similar interests, enable the inference of further behavior details when they are not directly retrievable from static or even dynamic user profiles.},

Particularly, in case of collaborative filtering system, more important issue is how to manipulate the personalized recommendation results for better user understandability and satisfaction. Collaborative filtering system predicts items of interest for users based on predictive relationship discovered between the item and others. In this paper, the categorization for grouping associative items mining, for the purpose of improving accuracy and performance in the item-based collaborative filtering, is proposed. It is possible that, if the associative item is required to be simultaneously regrouped in all other groups in which they occur, the proposed method regrouped the associative items into the relevant group. In addition, the proposed method can result in improved predictive performance under the sparse data and cold-start circumstance that starts from small items in the collaborative filtering. And this method can increase the prediction accuracy and the scalability because of removing the noise generated by ratings on items of dissimilar content or interest. The approach is empirically evaluated for comparison with k-means, average link, and robust, using the MovieLens dataset. This method was found to significantly outperform the previous method.},

A key technique for this purpose is whitelisting files, i.e., skipping the detailed analysis of files that match files in a well known reference collection of files. Effective use of this technique requires an efficient method to match files, detecting not only exact matches, but also near matches or approximate matches. This paper outlines the requirements for such matching, formalizes them as the bounded best match and approximate bounded near-match problems, and describes methods to solve these problems. In particular, the approximate bounded near-match problem is mapped to the problem of finding near neighbors in a high-dimensional metric space and solved using locality-sensitive hashing.},

Specifically, the extremely large size of document collections make it impossible to manually organize such documents. Additionally, most of the document sexist in an unstructured form and do not follow any schemas. Therefore, research efforts in this direction are being dedicated to automatically infer structure and schemas. This is essential in order to better organize huge collections as well as to effectively and efficiently retrieve documents in heterogeneous domains in networked system. This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art methods for inferring structure from documents and schemas in networked environments.

These six use cases demonstrate the difficulty to select the appropriate model elements and properties according to the IoT application context as well as to identify proper metrics for measuring UX. However, based on the six use cases experiments, a bottom-up (grounded) UX model applicable to any IoT use case appears to emerge from the empirical results. The experiments conducted within the use cases show the interest of the iterative nature of the Living Lab experiential design process for improving the design until it reaches the highest level of user satisfaction inducing an appropriate technology adoption rate by consumers.

Transfer learning tackles it from a different way: borrow labeled examples from a different but related domain (source domain) by assigning weights to those examples based on their suitability on the new domain (target domain). However, it is quite challenging to figure out the suitability. In this paper, we propose a different way for utilizing the labeled examples from source domain. That is, we use them only for labelling the unlabelled examples in the target domain. In this self-labelling, we use the idea of Tri-training. We call our new algorithm: TriTransfer. In TriTransfer, three initial classifiers are generated from the source data and the originally labeled data in the target domain, and an unlabeled example is labeled and added to the labeled data for a classifier if other two classifiers agree on its label. After an expanded labeled data set is obtained, we re-train the classifier. We repeat this process until no more change can be made. At the end, the final classifier, which is a weighted combination of the three classifiers, is output. We conduct an extensive empirical study on 34 UCI datasets, which shows that TriTransfer performs better than the state-of-art algorithms Transfer Boost, Tritraining, and NaiveBayes.},

  abstract  = {With the advent of Web 2.0 technology, researchers have attempted to use Web 2.0 tools to develop adaptive and cooperative learning environments. However, in building learning and teaching diagnostic system, one of the major difficulties is the lack of prior knowledge to help learners read and understand what they read in articles. Moreover, because of the lack of a mechanism to assist teachers in monitoring the running activities and student progress, such that constructive suggestions can be given to the students and tutoring strategies can be improved accordingly. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for calculating semantically meaningful prior knowledge and generating spreading energy for discovering student's reading status in semantic networks using a modified version of Semantic Analysis and Social Network techniques. An application to the development of a Tag-based Collaborative reading learning system is very useful for teachers and students.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a cross-modal approach for extracting semantic relationships between concepts using tagged images. In the proposed method, we first project both text and visual features of the tagged images to a latent space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Then, under the probabilistic interpretation of CCA, we calculate a representative distribution of the latent variables for each concept. Based on the representative distributions of the concepts, we derive two types of measures: the semantic relatedness between the concepts and the abstraction level of each concept. Because these measures are derived from a cross-modal scheme that enables the collaborative use of both text and visual features, the semantic relationships can successfully reflect semantic and visual contexts. Experiments conducted on tagged images collected from Flickr show that our measures are more coherent to human cognition than the conventional measures that use either text or visual features, or the WordNet-based measures. In particular, a new measure of semantic relatedness, which satisfies the triangle inequality, obtains the best results among different distance measures in our framework. The applicability of our measures to multimedia-related tasks such as concept clustering, image annotation and tag recommendation is also shown in the experiments.},

The results generated by the current algorithms often ignore diversity in the recommended results, which seriously affecting the user's experience. In this paper, we address the problem of diversified coverage based tag recommendation. To our best knowledge, it is first proposed in the context of tag recommendation. Since the NP-hardness of the problem, a greedy based diversified coverage tag recommendation algorithm, namely GDC, is proposed. First, it constructs a semantic similarity graph based on the local and global tag co-occurrence matrices, which improves the recommendation accuracy by incorporating both the user's interests and the popularity of tags. Further, GDC recursively searches the MIDS (Minimum Independent Dominating Set) in an efficient manner together with an effective pruning rule. The experiments conducted on the real datasets of MovieLens and Last.fm show that the proposed GDC improve the diversity significantly.},

To evaluate CLANdroid we created a benchmark consisting of 14,450 apps along with information on similar apps provided by Google Play. We also compared effectiveness of different semantic anchors for detecting similar apps as perceived by 27 users. The results show that using Android-specific semantic anchors are useful for detecting similar Android apps across different categories. We also measured the impact of third-party libraries and obfuscated code when identifying similar Android apps, and our results suggest that there is significant difference in the accuracy when third-party libraries are excluded.},

The era of social computing which represents the emergence of Web 2.0 collaborative technologies and social media has stimulated a wide discussion about collective intelligence and the global brain. This paper reviews the theory of distributed cognition in the light of these concepts in an attempt to analyze and understand the emergence process of intelligence that takes place in the context of computer-mediated collaborative and social media environments. It concludes by showing that the cognitive organization, which occurs within social interactions serves as a catalyst for intelligence to emerge on a group level.

Thus, an effective expert ranking strategy must be robust to such attacks. In this paper, we propose MHITS, an algorithm to rank users' expertise by exploiting the number of users' fair ratings and direct trust users gain in the online community. We integrate SumUp, a Sybil-resilient algorithm, into MHITS algorithm as a robust ranking strategy. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can ensure that the highly ranked experts are highly trusted users and provide the high number of fair ratings for the relevant media.

In this respect, needless to mention that ontologies can be of benefit for enhancing information retrieval metrics. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ontology learning from a folksonomy, which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations between tags. The main thrust of the introduced approach stands in putting the focus on the discovery of nontaxonomic relationships. The latter are often neglected, even though they are of paramount importance from a semantic point of view. The discovery process heavily relies on triadic concepts to discover and select related tags and to extract and label non-taxonomically relationships between related tags and external sources for tags filtering and non-taxonomic relationships extraction. In addition, we also discuss a new approach to evaluate obtained relations in an automatic way against WordNet repository and presents promising results for a real world folksonomy.},

By aggregation, we mean identifying, collecting, and curating the top performing syndicated sources in a discourse domain. Buzz, or urgent conversation about a topic or issue, once identified, can be used by communicators to raise the performance of their own social media messaging. Trends, once discovered, can be used to inform the decision-making processes of marketers, planners, or communicators.

This tool allows students to collaboratively tag classroom lecture/discussion in real time through synchronized transcription and audio recording. TNT provides a visualization that highlights the important classroom points and we argue facilitates better recall and a deeper understanding of the classroom material. Through our evaluation we were able to prove that all students can benefit from this tool. We also present a case study of one student with ADD and how they benefited.

We propose a novel approach, which overcomes these limitations by using semantic information recovered from byte code and an unsupervised algorithm to assign categories to software systems.

In addition, students identified useful facilities in the platform like group-private workspaces or commenting tools. Students' satisfaction was high, in fact they recommend the use of this approach in more subjects.},

  abstract  = {The problem of user's interest to item matching is at the core of recommendation systems and search engines. This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36% using the proposed algorithm.},

As a result, increasing number of web services has been developed. However, this abundance creates a vast collection of web services which makes the task of locating a suitable one more challenging and more difficult. Automatic clustering of web services groups together web services with similar functions. Clustering could greatly boost the power of web service search engines and generate tags to improve the search accuracy of tag-based service recommendation. In this paper, we propose a web service clustering technique based on Carrot search clustering and K-means to group similar services together to generate tags and we use naive bayes algorithm to classify web services. We also develop a tag-based service recommendation for WSDL documents. We demonstrate that the proposed clustering approach is effective for web service discovery.},

A social sharing websites is a developed online website service which enables users to add, share, annotate, and tag images. A large -scale user generated metadata that describes and gives information about other data and not only facilitate users in sharing and organizing multimedia contents but provide useful information to improve Media Retrieval, Unlimited backup and Management. A Personalized Image search tracks a registered user's log history, and then adjusts the search results based upon the interests, preferences and information needs of users. Personalized Image search differs from general Image Search, which returns identical search results to all users for identical queries, regardless of varied user interests and information needs. In this paper we exploit the Social annotations and Novel Framework for considering the user query relevance and user specific-topic to learn personalized image search. The proposed framework contains two techniques: 1) Utility and Prediction model for social annotations. 2) We introduce a Hit Matrix technique for user query relevance and preference into the specific topic space. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed method outperforms the existing method and also shows that the developed model demonstrates the effectives of the Personalized Image Search},

To achieve this, matching user profiles is required. Current methods are so restrictive and do not consider all the related problems. Particularly, they assume that two profiles describe the same physical person only if the values of their Inverse Functional Property or IFP (e.g. the email address, homepage, etc.) are the same. However, the observed trend in social networks is not fully compatible with this assumption since users tend to create more than one social network account (for personal use, for work, etc.) while using same or different email addresses. In this work, we address the problem of matching user profiles in its globality by providing a suitable matching framework able to consider all the profile's attributes. Our framework allows users to give more importance to some attributes and assign each attribute a different similarity measure. The set of experiments conducted with our default/recommended attribute/similarity measures shows the superiority of our proposal in comparison with current ones.},

In the context of Technology enhanced Learning (TeL), from a teachers' perspective, the unique ICT competence characteristics of individuals have not been considered when providing Learning Object (LO) recommendations, despite their vital contribution to the level of ICT uptake of teachers. Moreover, there is a lack of mechanisms for automatically eliciting and updating such personal characteristics within Learning Object Repositories (LOR) in order to exploit them for enhanced LO recommendations. Towards tackling this issue, this paper proposes a teacher ICT Competence elicitation mechanism utilizing fuzzy logic for inferring teachers' ICT Competences based on their usage patterns within LOR and presents the results of its preliminary accuracy evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides high accuracy and can, therefore, construct reliable depictions of the teachers' ICT Competence Profiles.},

  abstract  = {GitHub is a well-known software community where a large number of software repositories are hosted. Since large amounts of documents and code in GitHub repositories are in a mess, users cannot search or understand them efficiently. One solution is to employ a tag system, which annotates each repository with several tags. Thus, the GitHub repositories can be more efficiently accessed and understood. However, GitHub does not provide any automated tools of tagging repositories. In order to tackle this problem, we propose GRETA, a novel graph-based approach to assigning tags for repositories on GitHub. The core insight of GRETA is (1) to construct an Entity-Tag Graph (ETG) for GitHub using the domain knowledge from StackOverflow, and (2) to assign tags for repositories by taking a random walk algorithm. We have implemented GRETA and also developed a repository search engine for GitHub using the tag assignment results of GRETA. We have evaluated GRETA against several baseline methods to investigate its effectiveness of tagging GitHub repositories. The results show GRETA achieves up to 35% of F-Measure, outperforming the baseline methods. Besides, the GRETA-based search engine gains a higher NDCG value than the search engine provided by GitHub, indicating that it significantly enhances the search ability on GitHub with the tagged repositories.},

Attackers usually leverage the popumobile smart phoneslarity of Android apps by inserting malwares, modifying the original apps, repackaging and releasing them for their own illegal purposes. To avoid repackaged apps from being detected, they usually use sorts of obfuscation and encryption tools. As a result, it's important to detect which apps are repackaged. People often intuitively judge whether two apps are a repackaged pair by executing them and observing their runtime user interface (UI) traces. Hence, we propose layout group graph (LGG) built from UI trances to model those UI behaviors and use LGG as the birthmark of Android apps for identification. Based on LGG, we also implement a dynamic repackaging detection tool, RepDroid. Since our method does not require the apps' source code, it is resilient to app obfuscation and encryption. We conducted an experiment with two data sets. The first set contains 98 pairs of repackaged apps. The original apps and repackaged ones are compared and we can detect all of these repackaged pairs. The second set contains 125 commercial apps. We compared them pair-wisely and the false positive rate was 0.08%.},

Concerns about patient privacy, the difficulty of developing appropriate computing tools and information technology, high costs, and the resistance of some physicians and nurses have hampered the use of technology in health care. In 2009, the U.S. government committed billions of dollars to health care technology. Many questions remain, however, about how to deploy these resources. In Health Informatics, experts in technology, joined by clinicians, use diabetes--a costly, complex, and widespread disease that involves nearly every facet of the health care system--to examine the challenges of using the tools of information technology to improve patient care. Unlike other books on medical informatics that discuss such topics as computerized order entry and digital medical records, Health Informatics focuses on the patient, charting the information problems patients encounter in different stages of the disease. [Chapters discuss ubiquitous computing as a tool to move diabetes care out of the doctor's office, technology and chronic disease management, educational gaming as a way to help patients understand their disease, patient access to information, and methodological and theoretical concerns.] We need both technologists and providers at the drawing board in order to design and deploy effective digital tools for health care.

For an unlabeled image, we first retrieve its visual neighbors from a large user-tagged image database. We then select relevant tags from the result images to annotate the unlabeled image. To tackle the unreliability and sparsity of user tagging, we introduce a joint-modality tag relevance estimation method which efficiently addresses both textual and visual clues. Experiments on 1.5 million Flickr photos and 10 000 Corel images verify the proposed method.},

In a recent work, large collections of geotagged images were found to be helpful in estimating geo-locations of query images by simple visual nearest-neighbors search. In this paper, we leverage user tags along with image content to infer the geo-location. Our model builds upon the fact that the visual content and user tags of pictures can provide significant hints about their geo-locations. Using a large collection of over a million geotagged photographs, we build location probability maps of user tags over the entire globe. These maps reflect the picture-taking and tagging behaviors of thousands of users from all over the world, and reveal interesting tag map patterns. Visual content matching is performed using multiple feature descriptors including tiny images, color histograms, GIST features, and bags of textons. The combination of visual content matching and local tag probability maps forms a strong geo-inference engine. Large-scale experiments have shown significant improvements over pure visual content-based geo-location inference.},

In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem and propose, as a first step, a set of mapping rules for aligning teachers' ICT competences and LO metadata elements. Moreover, a preliminary simulated evaluation is described, the results of which indicate that the mapping schema can provide robust identification of appropriate LOs based on both the users' ICT competences and the overall ratings of the educational resources.},

  abstract = {Most explanations of the user behavior while interacting with the web are based on a top-down approach, where the entire Web, viewed as a vast collection of pages and interconnection links, is used to predict how the users interact with it. A prominent example of this approach is the random-surfer model, the core ingredient behind Google's PageRank. This model exploits the linking structure of the Web to estimate the percentage of web surfers viewing any given page. Contrary to the top-down approach, a bottom-up approach starts from the user and incrementally builds the dynamics of the web as the result of the users' interaction with it. The second approach has not being widely investigated, although there are numerous advantages over the top-down approach regarding (at least) personalization and decentralization of the required infrastructure for web tools. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach to study the web dynamics based on web-related data browsed, collected, tagged, and semi-organized by end users. Our approach has been materialized into a hybrid bottom-up search engine that produces search results based solely on user provided web-related data and their sharing among users. We conduct an extensive experimental study to demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of user generated web-related data, their strength, and weaknesses as well as to compare the search results of our bottom-up search engine with those of a traditional one. Our study shows that a bottom-up search engine starts from a core consisting of the most interesting part of the Web (according to user opinions) and incrementally (and measurably) improves its ranking, coverage, and accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be integrated with PageRank, resulting in a new page ranking algorithm that can uniquely combine link analysis with users' preferences.},

To understand why there is a large gap between a user's explicit network and her implicit user-user association networks based on common resources or common tags, we compared a users' bookmark resources and tags to those of her explicit network members. Our results suggest that a typical social bookmarking service user does not create her explicit network based on common interests. We discuss the implications behind the gap between a user's explicit network and implicit network and propose solutions to enhance and improve the “social” functions of social bookmarking services.},

The a typicality is a conditional probability that a page is atypical in the category when it belongs to the category. Both probabilities are calculated by using tags of social bookmark services and words in Web pages. We evaluated the proposed relevancy score by classifying whether Web pages belong to a certain category.

To provide information for the relevance judgment, we propose a novel method for generating personalized snippets for web page recommender systems. Our method directly uses the reasons the web pages are recommended to the user. This use of reasons enables snippets to be selected that better reflect the interest of the user. Moreover, our method can work with various web page recommender systems. It also leverages the maximum coverage summarization model to generate personalized snippets. The results of an experiment on a manually created dataset show that our method is more effective than a personalized summarization model.},

This paper considers a P2P data dissemination scenario, and applies an autonomic trust protocol that forms social network structures to incentive cooperation. Trust links are formed according to the simple criterion that `individuals seek to interact with others at least as cooperative as themselves' and these links are used to prioritise the choice of peers to interact with. The success of the protocol is validated through a prisoner's dilemma based simulation which uses the similarity of interest between peers to define pay-offs. While the variation in interests reduces the average payoff (per iteration) received by the most cooperative individuals, only the most `divergent' and uncooperative nodes are heavily affected and ostracized from interaction by other cooperative nodes.},

The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be "implicit". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented). The paper discusses these issues in detail and provides an overview of pioneering efforts in the field.},

Tags can be used for improving of searching, categorization of web-documents, creating folksonomies and ontologies or enhancing the user-model. Another aspect of tags is that they act as a bridge between resources and users to create a social network. We integrated tags in a learning framework ALEF and experimentally evaluated their usage in education process.},

Increased collaboration among the learners and mentors makes the learning experience efficient. This paper proposes an enhanced Pedagogical strategy for searching content through the use of ontologies and the learner's profile. The proposed system makes use of ontologies and learner profiles for crawling, indexing and organizing content. The content is then filtered based on the learner and "learner like" learners' profile to provide a rich Open Social Learning experience. Natural Language Processing is then used to semantically categorize the learning content. It has been shown that this proposed pedagogical strategy, using the ontologies and user profiles for search, Natural Language Processing for programmatic content categorization and graph database to identify learning styles of the underrepresented learners, provides an enhanced learner centered online learning experience.},

SeViAnno is a long-term development addressing in particular such engineering tasks. The current release is based on RESTful Web services enabling much easier integration of new input and output formats on the metadata management level as well as an easier development process of mobile and Web-based clients. This will be demonstrated by different existing prototypes.

However, most of the tools for requirements management are not simple enough to encourage the stakeholders' participation. Contributing towards this goal, this paper responds with a proposal to facilitate collaborative requirements management, which supports the four classical processes of requirements management: elicitation, analysis, specification and validation. The elicitation and analysis of requirements is made with the support of wiki-based front-ends and then, the requirements are specified and handled in an ontology, thus enabling advanced reasoning capabilities able to support the requirements validation and enterprises' resources management (e.g. Prioritize solutions) during the course of products and services development lifecycle.},

Particularly, we believe that it is necessary for code search engines to not merely index code, but also construct a rich network of social-technical information that surrounds that code. With such information, much richer queries can be issued and novel interfaces can be built through which the results of such queries can be explored more intuitively. We make the case for social-technical code search, introduce six categories of social-technical information and how it would enhance search, and briefly introduce CodeExchange, our prototype platform we are developing to explore social-technical code search.},

This is often the case in bug and feature location, community question answering, or more generally the communication between technical personnel and non-technical stake holders in a software project. In this paper, we propose bridging the lexical gap by projecting natural language statements and code snippets as meaning vectors in a shared representation space. In the proposed architecture, word embeddings are rst trained on API documents, tutorials, and reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously explored bug localization task and a newly de ned task of linking API documents to computer programming questions.},

We have developed a MATLAB toolbox called CTAGGER to enable a user-friendly, semi-structured and expandable strategy for event annotation in dynamic brain imaging and other time-series. To facilitate common labeling and comparison across data collections and laboratories, an individual's annotation can be collected in a common community database to encourage annotation reuse. The tools allow the creation of multiple event overlays to facilitate the reuse and combination of brain imaging data for multiple analyses.},

Metadata of that type are invaluable as it is difficult for ordinary computer software to extract equivalent metadata from the Web. Acquiring image metadata such as the type and location of objects in images requires a computer to use machine learning techniques, needing training with sample images and Web search techniques, with the outcome that only limited image metadata are extracted. Furthermore, the semantic image relationship metadata is based upon peoplepsilas image perception, hence user feedback is required to acquire it. KnownStyleNoLife provides a social value to users in return for their explicit annotations. It is a novel approach to harness human power to acquire relevant image metadata.},

  abstract  = {GitHub contains millions of repositories among which many are similar with one another (i.e., having similar source codes or implementing similar functionalities). Finding similar repositories on GitHub can be helpful for software engineers as it can help them reuse source code, build prototypes, identify alternative implementations, explore related projects, find projects to contribute to, and discover code theft and plagiarism. Previous studies have proposed techniques to detect similar applications by analyzing API usage patterns and software tags. However, these prior studies either only make use of a limited source of information or use information not available for projects on GitHub. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can effectively detect similar repositories on GitHub. Our approach is designed based on three heuristics leveraging two data sources (i.e., GitHub stars and readme files) which are not considered in previous works. The three heuristics are: repositories whose readme files contain similar contents are likely to be similar with one another, repositories starred by users of similar interests are likely to be similar, and repositories starred together within a short period of time by the same user are likely to be similar. Based on these three heuristics, we compute three relevance scores (i.e., readme-based relevance, stargazer-based relevance, and time-based relevance) to assess the similarity between two repositories. By integrating the three relevance scores, we build a recommendation system called RepoPal to detect similar repositories. We compare RepoPal to a prior state-of-the-art approach CLAN using one thousand Java repositories on GitHub. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RepoPal achieves a higher success rate, precision and confidence over CLAN.},

The technique demonstrates a number of advantages over alternative methods for displaying and exploring geo-referenced search results and spatio-temporal data. Firstly, cluster summaries can be presented in a manner that makes them easy to read and scan. Listing representative events from each cluster also helps the process of discovery by preserving the diversity of results. Also, clicking on visual representations of geo-temporal clusters provides a quick and intuitive way to navigate across space and time simultaneously. This removes the need to overload users with the display of too many event labels at any one time.

  abstract  = {As larger and larger amounts of data are harvested, finding just the right piece of information out of this noisy and heterogeneous ocean of data remains challenging. Many widely adopted scientific data search engines continue to be mainly based on text semantics. However, it is not uncommon in scientific big data applications to face collected data that do not possess text information. In this scenario, search engines fail to retrieve potentially relevant data. For instance, even though Pangaea, a digital data library and a publisher for earth system science, contains more than 400,000 datasets, more than 98% lack sufficient text information. In this work, we propose a novel pseudo relevance feedback method based on spatio-temporal and text (STT) information for scientific big data: STT-PRF. Although STT-PRF may simultaneously use STT information, we show that the missing values in space, time or/and the text are handled efficiently. STT-PRF is especially robust even without text information. We tested our STT-PRF method using the Pangaea repository on our Cross-DB Search Platform, which is a search engine for scientific big data based on various latent correlations. Experimental evaluations on such standard metrics as nDCG and Precision/Recall show that STT-PRF outperforms the standard baseline methods.},

Following this methodology, a huge quantity of data is being published on the Web of Data, but very little is currently consumed by educational applications. This paper proposes to overcome this situation by relating educational vocabularies to the ones already used on the Web of Data. This way, educational applications can take advantage of the data published on the Web even if such data was not published for educational purposes. As a case study, the vocabulary used by an educational tool search system, called Ontoolsearch, is related to ICT tool descriptions published by DBpedia and Factforge. Evaluation results show that 2905 tool descriptions can be retrieved from the Web of Data to be consumed by Ontoolsearch. In addition, most of these descriptions have a similar quality to the ones manually published by an educational tool expert.},

  abstract = {One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.},

Hence, for average mobile users there is an increasing cognitive burden in finding the most appropriate service among the many available. On the other hand, methodologies such as bookmarks and resource tagging require a great arranging effort to handle increasing resources. To help mobile users in managing and using this personal information space, new levels of granularity should be introduced in the organization of services, together with some degree of self-awareness. This paper proposes a situation-aware service recommender that helps locating services proactively. In the recommender, a semantic layer determines one or more user current situations by using domain knowledge expressed in terms of ontology and semantic rules. A fuzzy inference layer manages the vagueness of some contextual condition of these rules and outputs an uncertainty degree for each situation. Based on this degree, the recommender proposes a set of specific resources.},

Co-tagging networks have been studied by applying social network analysis (SNA) metrics so as to: (a) draw significant insights about the influence of central users to the (tagging) behaviour of other users and (b) identify clusters of taggers based on the content of the tags that they use. Nevertheless, there are no previous works, which have studied co-tagging networks in the field of Learning Object Repositories (LORs).

Although a collaborative filtering process can well predict the users' interests and preferences, it cannot efficiently analyze de-sign information while considering the con-tents of specific items. The process extracts features from the image data that the users are interested in to mitigate a problem, which is regarded as an undulated analysis, and then recom-mends an automotive design by combining the image filtering and collaborative filtering that use the static relationship between the users' preference and the image color information.

As tagging has become widespread on the Web, the tag vocabulary is now very informal, uncontrolled, and personalized. For this reason, many tags are unfamiliar and ambiguous to users so that they fail to understand the meaning of each tag. In this paper, we propose a tag sense disambiguating method, called tag sense disambiguation (TSD), which works in the social tagging environment. TSD can be applied to the vocabulary of social tags, thereby enabling users to understand the meaning of each tag through Wikipedia. To find the correct mappings from del.icio.us tags to Wikipedia articles, we define the local neighbor tags, the global neighbor tags, and finally the neighbor tags that would be the useful key-words for disambiguating the sense of each tag based on the tag co-occurrences. The automatically built mappings are reasonable in most cases. The experiment shows that TSD can find the correct mappings with high accuracy.},

A system developed using the proposed models is adaptive (adapts the recommended tags to the existing set of tags), has a feedback (after each tagging, the set of tags and the dictionary are updated), is personalized (each user develops its own set of tags), and is semantics-aware (uses an ontology to refine tags).

Novel artists whose popularity is on the rise have a higher priority to be recommended. Specifically, given a user's favorite artists, the system first determines the candidate artists based on their similarity with the favorite artists and then selects those who have a higher novelty score than the favorite artists. Then, the system outputs a playlist composed of the most popular songs of the selected artists. The proposed system can be integrated into most existing systems. Its performance is evaluated using the Spotify Radio Recommender as a reference and a pool of 100 subjects recruited on campus.

Though the current semantic-based service discovery methods enhance the recall rate and precision in a way, most of the semantic-based service discovery methods are based on the new model of the semantic web and the ontology language, the number of the services based on the model of the semantic web and the ontology language is so little that these methods can not been used effectively. In this paper, we bring forward a new service discovery method based on the service tags. In order to discover service based on the services tags, we bring forward the algorithm QEBT and QPBT. Our experimental study shows that the algorithm QPBT is better than QEBT. Furthermore, both QEBT and QPBT are effective on discovering service.},

In this paper, we explore how “tagging,” a lightweight social computing mechanism, is used to communicate matters of concern in the management of development tasks. We present the results from two empirical studies over 36 and 12 months, respectively, on how tagging has been adopted and what role it plays in the development processes of several professional development projects with more than 1,000 developers in total. Our research shows that the tagging mechanism was eagerly adopted by the teams, and that it has become a significant part of many informal processes. Different kinds of tags are used by various stakeholders to categorize and organize work items. The tags are used to support finding of tasks, articulation work, and information exchange. Implicit and explicit mechanisms have evolved to manage the tag vocabulary. Our findings indicate that lightweight informal tool support, prevalent in the social computing domain, may play an important role in improving team-based software development practices.},

Web 2.0 is a new medium where users are not just consumers, but are also contributors. By contributing content to the system, users become part of the network and relationships between users and content can be derived. Example applications are collaborative bookmarking networks such as delicious and file sharing applications such as YouTube and Flickr. These networks rely on user contributed content, described and classified using tags. The wealth of user generated content can be hard to navigate and search due to difficulties in comparing documents with similar tags and the application of traditional information retrieval scoring techniques are limited. Evaluating the time evolving interests of users may be used to derive quality of content. In this paper, we propose a technique to rank documents based on reputation. The reputation is a combination of the number of bookmarkers, the reputation of the bookmarking user and the time dynamics of the document. Experimental results and analysis are presented on a large collaborative IBM bookmarking network called Dogear.},

In such a system as more users come in to evaluate items (be they information pieces, products or otherwise), a network of users starts to be formed. In this paper we are interested in the dynamics of such a network, in particular we investigate if there is a hidden law that captures the essence of such networks irrespective of their size. The discovery of such a law would allow, among other usages, generation of synthetic data sets, realistic enough to be used for simulation purposes. Furthermore, it would be useful for information-seeking activities such as locating known experts or influential users on a particular subject. Similar work in related fields suggested the existence of power-laws, which seem to be ubiquitous. However, in our work we did not detect the presence of such a law, instead we discovered an exponential relationship between the nodes of a graph representing users, and edges representing similarity between users. In particular the logarithm of the degree of node is linearly related to the ranking of the node in a decreasing order. The above conclusion is justified by extended experiments on two versions of the movie lens data set (one comprised 100,000 user evaluations, while the other comprised 1,000,0000 evaluations).},

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tag recommendation algorithm, which can be used in the large-scale and real-time data process effectively and efficiently. Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy One problem of folksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task.},

  abstract = {Recent growth in broadband access and proliferation of small personal devices that capture images and videos has led to explosive growth of multimedia content available everywhere - from personal disks to the Web. While digital media capture and upload has become nearly universal with newer device technology, there is still a need for better tools and technologies to search large collections of multimedia data and to find and deliver the right content to a user according to her current needs and preferences. A renewed focus on the subjective dimension in the multimedia lifecycle, from creation, distribution, to delivery and consumption, is required to address this need beyond what is feasible today. Integration of the subjective aspects of the media itself - its affective, perceptual, and physiological potential (both intended and achieved), together with those of the users themselves will allow for personalizing the content access, beyond today's facility. This integration, transforming the traditional multimedia information retrieval (MIR) indexes to more effectively answer specific user needs, will allow a richer degree of personalization predicated on user intention and mode of interaction, relationship to the producer, content of the media, and their history and lifestyle. In this paper, we identify the challenges in achieving this integration, current approaches to interpreting content creation processes, to user modelling and profiling, and to personalized content selection, and we detail future directions. The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section I, we introduce the problem and present some definitions. In Section II, we present a review of the aspects of personalized content and current approaches for the same. Section III discusses the problem of obtaining metadata that is required for personalized media creation and present eMediate as a case study of an integrated media capture environment. Section IV presents the MAGIC system as a case stud- - y of capturing effective descriptive data and putting users first in distributed learning delivery. The aspects of modelling the user are presented as a case study in using user's personality as a way to personalize summaries in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper with a discussion on the emerging challenges and the open problems.},

The key advantage of our model is that it allows a large number of users to participate, easily, in annotating services with tags. This is in contrast to more expressive, logic based models of services, such as semantic Web service models, which require significant expertise for annotation and maintenance. Our folksonomy-based model allows associating semantic constraints on the input and output messages of web service operations using tags obtained from a folksonomy. We show how the model can be used for discovery and composition of services. We also describe a planner that uses this model to compose services and create workflows, automatically. We present performance results for the planner and our experiences in using this model in a sample real-world domain.},

However, only very basic techniques are applied for generating recommendations. In this paper, we present a recommender system for a social bookmarking site to generate resource recommendations rather than tag recommendations. Our system is based on two ideas: similar users are interested in similar resources and similar resources have similar tags. Our system generates recommendations by automatically taking into account what resources a user tags and the co-occurrence of tags. Our method is tested on large-scale real life datasets. The experimental results show that our method achieves a good recommendation performance.},

In this paper, we present a novel incremental and scalable web-supervised learning system that continuously learns appearance models for image categories with heterogeneous appearances and improves these models periodically. Simply specifying the name of the concept that has to be learned initializes the proposed system, and there is no further supervision afterwards. Textual and visual information on web sites are used to filter out irrelevant and misleading training images. To obtain a robust, flexible, and updatable way of learning, a novel learning framework is presented that relies on clustering in order to identify visual subclasses before using an ensemble of random forests, called random savanna, for subclass learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed web-supervised learning approach outperforms a support vector machine (SVM), while at the same time being simply parallelizable in the training and testing phases.},

On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones. In the experiments, the developed recommender system is tested on two different data sets; and the experiment results indicate that this system is more effective than CoFiDS, a typical recommender system offering soft ratings.},

These systems achieved widespread success on the Web on account of the simplicity for organizing resources using open-ended tags. Recently, tag recommendation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problems of ambiguity, syntactic variations and noise in tags cause by the inherent characteristics of natural language. In this work we proposed a content-based approach that generates a list of suggested tags for annotating a given resource starting from an analysis of its textual content exclusively. Thus, the proposed method can be used in situations in which there is not enough information for creating a tag-based user profile or compare the user with others. For extracting the more relevant words different term weighting approaches were evaluated, particularly considering the HTML structure of Web pages and the grammatical category of words in order to determine promising tag candidates. Experimental results of applying this technique to tag recommendation using several term weighting approaches are reported and compared.},

In this paper, we firstly define the diversity of a user's social circle, which means the dispersion extent of the user's friend distribution in the network. A method for measuring diversity and broadness of a user's social circle in network is also presented. Preliminary experiment demonstrates that user's social circle does matter in information diffusion. Moreover, a social circle weighted PageRank algorithm which takes both popularity (in-degree) and social circle broadness into account is proposed.

  abstract  = {Social networks are usually navigable small worlds: individuals are able to find short chains of acquaintances connecting pairs of unrelated nodes. This property can be explained by the fact that nodes are characterized by a series of properties, such as geographical position, work or educational background; the navigation proceeds towards the node that is "most similar" to the destination. Since nodes are likely to be linked with similar individuals, this strategy permits to quickly reach the destination. We approach the problem of creating the information that makes a network navigable. Starting from a given network, and without any other information, we show how nodes can reconstruct, with a scalable and decentralized algorithm, a "network map": a d-dimensional layout that places nodes in a way that reflects the network structure, so that navigability is achieved. Euclidean distance on the layout is used as a measure for node similarity, and efficient routing can be simply achieved by iteratively jumping towards the neighbor that is closest to the destination. The network map provides a means for implementing routing on social networks that can be used in "darknets", that is, anonymous networks where nodes establish connections only if they are mutually trusted. Moreover, the distance between nodes on the network map can be used as a measure of node affinity, and may help in various types of network analysis, for instance to help evaluate reputation in webs of trust, or in order to perform "personalized" ranking.},

  abstract = {A new triple wing harmonium (TWH) model that integrates text metadata into a low-dimensional semantic space is proposed for the application of content-based movie recommendation. The text metadata considered here include movie synopsis, actor list, and user comments. We develop a new TWH model projecting these multiple textual features into low-dimensional latent topics with different probability distribution assumptions. A contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm is used for efficient learning and inference. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms for movie recommendation.},

  abstract = {Social image tagging systems mostly suffer from poor performance for image retrieval due to the noisy and incomplete correspondences between user-contributed images and their associated tags. In this letter, we aim to refine tag allocations in the social tagging data provided by these systems. In particular, we propose to harness the tagged and untagged data with a two-stage strategy according to different types of data relations, i.e. item similarity defined by prior knowledge and item co-occurrence learned from data statistics. To solve the sparsity problem, we first introduce a new graph learning (GL) method for enriching the tagging data according to item similarities. Then, we develop a method of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for learning more coherent ternary relations among users, images and tags coupled by the manifold constraints learned from item co-occurrences. Experimental results with the tagging data from the NUS-WIDE dataset have been reported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Ontologies provide an effective means of capturing and integrating knowledge for feedback provisioning, while using collaborative activities can support pedagogical theories, such as social constructivism. Both technologies have developed separately in the e-learning domain; representing respectively a teacher-centered and a learner-centered approach for learning environments. In this paper we bridge the gap between these two approaches by leveraging the social semantic Web paradigm, and propose a collaborative semantic-rich learning environment in which folksonomies created from studentspsila collaborative tags contribute to ontology maintenance, and teacher-directed feedback.},

  abstract = {The web is perceived as a new social platform. Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.},

  abstract  = {Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media. Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (e.g., breaking events) and stable topics (e.g., user interests). Due to their different natures, it is important and useful to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However, such a discrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are very short in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporal topics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically, a unified user-temporal mixture model is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model's performance, we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information in a social network, as well as a burst-weighted smoothing scheme that exploits temporal prior information in the time dimension. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposal on two real data sets obtained from Del.icio.us and Twitter. The experimental results verify that our mixture model is able to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in a single detection process. Our mixture model enhanced with the spatial regularization and the burst-weighted smoothing scheme significantly outperforms competitor approaches, in terms of topic detection accuracy and discrimination in stable and temporal topics.},

However, in some applications, labeled data are either costly to collect or easily outdated, resulting in poor generalization of trained machine learners. Nonetheless, there are often related domains where large corpuses of labeled data can be easily obtained. Therefore, we propose a new transfer learning algorithm to adapt a neural network trained on such a related domain to the target domain by grafting additional nodes onto its hidden layer. This neural grafting method is capable of transfering the knowledge embedded in the structures of the trained neural network to the problem in the target domain. Experiments on synthesized and real data sets show that grafted networks achieve good performance with very small amounts of data from the target domain. Compared with existing transfer learning techniques, the proposed neural grafting is easy to tune and computationally simple, with superior performance.},

We then present conclusions from this analysis and relate them to work patterns in enterprises with the goal of advancing social media to the next level making them better fit the work context and more relevant for people in their work functions.

Its goal is to help people understand and manage information and make right decisions accordingly. In the ever-changing social, organizational and technological contexts, Information Architects not only design individual information spaces (e.g., individual websites, software applications, and mobile devices), but also tackle strategic aggregation and integration of multiple information spaces across websites, channels, modalities, and platforms. Not only they create predetermined navigation pathways, but also provide tools and rules for people to organize information on their own and get connected with others. Information Architects work with multi-disciplinary teams to determine the user experience strategy based on user needs and business goals, and make sure the strategy gets carr ed out by following the user-centered design (UCD) process via close collaboration with others. Drawing on the author(s) extensive experience as HCI researchers, User Experience Design practitioner, and Information Architecture instructors, this book provides a balanced view of the IA discipline by applying the IA theories, design principles and guidelines to the IA and UX practices.

  abstract  = {Autonomic and autonomous systems exist within a world view of their own. This world view is created from the training data and assumptions that were available at their inception. In most of these systems this world view becomes obsolete over time due to changes in the environment. This brings a level of inaccuracy in the autonomic behavior of the system. When this degradation reaches a certain threshold self-healing or self-optimizing systems generally recreate the world view using current data and assumptions. However, the self-optimization process is akin to kill a fly with a hammer for minor tuning of the world view. Instead we propose the idea of self-calibration for self-managing these systems. We define self-calibration as the ability of the system to perceive the need for and the ability to execute minimal tuning to bridge the gap between system's world view and incoming information about the outside world. In this paper we present a case for considering self-calibration as a self-* enabling property of systems specifically for time-critical systems using data-centric AI technologies. We present our case by discussing three case studies from different domains where self-calibration enables a system to become self-healing or self-optimizing. We then place self-calibration in a generic system and explicitly describe the types of systems in which self-calibration can be implemented and the benefits that one can accrue from its inclusion.},

Matching is done on clusters on the description generated within WSDL file to get the desired service. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that out approach is more efficient and increases recall ratio towards matching services.

Within this publication we analyse underlying statistical properties of broad folksonomies aiming to identify laws and characteristics, which allow inferring properties for folksonomy based retrieval. The actual benefit of folksonomies for retrieval and the derived methods are concluded from experiments with aggregated data from del.icio.us1.},

Our main finding is that the majority of SW schemas with a significant number of properties (respectively, classes) approximate a power law for total-degree (respectively, the number of subsumed classes) distribution. Moreover, our analysis revealed some emerging conceptual modeling practices of SW schema developers: (1) each schema has a few focal classes that have been analyzed in detail (that is, they have numerous properties and subclasses), which are further connected with focal classes defined in other schemas, (2) class subsumption hierarchies are mostly unbalanced (that is, some branches are deep and heavy, while others are shallow and light), (3) most properties have as domain/range classes that are located high at the class subsumption hierarchies, and (4) the number of recursive/multiple properties is significant. The knowledge of these features is essential for guiding synthetic SW schema generation, which is an important step toward benchmarking SW repositories and query language implementations.},

People rely on these sites to obtain information due to the number of advantages they offer as compared to conventional sources of knowledge (e.g., asynchronous and convenient access). However, for the same question one may find highly contradictory answers, causing ambiguity with respect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/or non-expert users. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating the reliability and expertise of a user based on human cognitive traits. Every user can individually estimate these values based on local pairwise interactions. We examine the convergence performance of our algorithm and we find that it can accurately assess the reliability and the expertise of a user and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change.},

We present Sally, an automatic software tagging approach that is able to produce meaningful tags for Maven-based software projects by analyzing their bytecode and dependency relations without any special requirements from developers. We compared tags generated by Sally to the ones in two widely used online repositories, and the tags generated by a state-of-the-art categorization approach.

As a consequence, various kinds of algorithms have been proposed in the last few years to improve the recommendation performance. However, many of them overlook users' rating behaviors. In this paper, an improved recommendation algorithm with considering users' habits and rating behaviors will be proposed. Firstly, calculate the ratings entropy for each user via users' rating records which can reflect users' behavioral features. Secondly, widely-used user-based method will be improved by considering rating entropy. Finally, the predicting rate is generated. Experimental results on the three datasets: Movie Lens, Netflix and RYM all suggest that the proposed method can enhance the algorithmic accuracy. Furthermore, since this method can improve those missing value more accurately via users' similarity and rating behaviors which might shed some light on discovering users' purchasing intention and optimizing the performance of recommender systems by human dynamics.},

Links and tags can have variable scopes ranging from small document passages to a collection of several documents. Physical folders along with camera-based marker tracking provide for the tangible definition of document collections. Tags are intuitively defined on a paper tag menu card.

In this paper we address the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classification by combining deep learning, for acquiring a cross-domain high-level feature representation, and ensemble methods, for reducing the cross-domain generalization error. The proposed adaptation framework has been evaluated on a benchmark dataset composed of reviews of four different Amazon category of products, significantly outperforming the state of the art methods.},

We present data and their analysis for how this social media platform has been used in HP over the past five years. We then present conclusions from this analysis and relate them to work patterns in enterprises with the goal to better adapt social media platforms to the enterprise domain such that they better integrate with the work context people have as well as with IT systems that are used by them. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we present data and usage analysis of our social media platform over the past five years.

Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

  abstract  = {Transfer learning aims to improve a targeted learning task using other related auxiliary learning tasks and data. Most current transfer-learning methods focus on scenarios where the auxiliary and the target learning tasks are very similar: either (some of) the auxiliary data can be directly used as training examples for the target task or the auxiliary and the target data share the same representation. However, in many cases the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks can be remote. Only a few features derived from the auxiliary data may be helpful for the target learning. We call such scenario the deep transfer-learning scenario and we introduce a novel transfer-learning method for deep transfer. Our method uses restricted Boltzmann machine to discover a set of hierarchical features from the auxiliary data. We then select from these features a subset that are helpful for the target learning, using a selection criterion based on the concept of kernel-target alignment. Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training. Our experiment results show that this transfer method is effective. It can improve classification accuracy by up to more than 10%, even when the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks is not apparent.},

The collection of user reviews would generate a positive or negative influence to the media audience. Some malicious users may create multiple variant accounts on the same social media so as to influence or manipulate public opinions for business or criminal purposes. To maintain good social environment, it is necessary to find those fake users. In this paper, we investigate the user variants identification problem using both user behavior and item related information. We study the characteristics of user behaviors on social media and introduce two concepts visibility and distingushibility to preliminarily quantify whether a fake user can be identified. To better understand user intention and characteristics, we profile a user with apparent and implicit features, which are extracted from three aspects: User Generated Contents (UGC), user behavior context and item information. Based on these features, we propose the user Variants Identification Problem (VIP) and an identification algorithm, which finds the top-k similar variants in a social media. We evaluate our methods against two real datasets MovieLens and Amazon and make comparison on the effectiveness against different features in identifying user variants.},

In this context, one of our contributions [1] proposes an algorithm enabling to compute user's interests using information from egocentric network extracted communities. Therefore, mining information from a small or a sparse network remains challenging because there is not enough information to enrich a relevant user's profile. So, one of the main lock is to cope with the lack of information that is considered as an important issue to extract a relevant community and could lead to misinterpretations in the user's profile modeling process. We aim to improve the performance of [1], regarding the lack of information problem, in the case of a small and/or a sparse network. We propose to add more information (i.e. relations) into user's network before extracting the data and enriching his profile. To achieve this enrichment, we suggest using snowball sampling technique to identify and add user's distance-2 neighbors (friends of a friend) into the user's egocentric network. Our experimentation conducted in DBLP demonstrates the interest of node integration into small and sparse network. This leads to the study of link prediction that enables us to provide better performances and results compared to the existing work.},

In this paper a new approach to semantic annotation on 3D content is proposed. In this approach, much of the manual work on annotation is replaced with a semi-automatic process based on prior gathering of domain expertise. The geometric properties of objects and their spatial relationships are first automatically extracted and associated with a general ontology, the result of which is then matched against a set of user-defined rules to create annotations represented in an application ontology. The approach is Web3D oriented so that it can take advantage of features of X3D format. It will be shown using a prototype system how this approach can succeed in accelerating the annotation process.},

In this paper, we present a utilization of semantic Web 2.0 for self-reconfiguration of SOA based agent applications in ISR. The software architecture of ISR consists of service agents which are modules to provide information and knowledge. When ISR meets an irresolvable situation it searches and downloads a necessary service agent from the external service repository, executes the agent, and resolves the situation. The prototype implemented to show the situation has confirmed the validity of our study. Thus this study is expected to contribute to adding more intelligence to robots.},

In our method, the connections are modeled as object entity, with attributes describing their content, and operations defining the legal manipulation upon them. The connections have inheritance relationships between them and thus form an inheritance tree. We presented our consideration in designing the object-oriented model of connection; and developed a prototype to show its advantages over the traditional approach.},

In this work, we have evaluated several top-performance classification techniques for such purpose.

  abstract = {The concept of “event” emerged in recent years as a key feature to efficiently index and retrieve media. Several approaches have been proposed to analyze the relationship between events and media, enable event discovery, and perform event-based media tagging, indexing, and retrieval. Despite the outstanding work done in this area, a major problem that remains open is how to infer the link between visual concepts and events. In particular, the possibility of understanding which perceptual elements allow a human recognizing the event depicted by an image would open new directions in event media discovery. In this paper we introduce the concept of event saliency to define the above event-revealing perceptual elements, and we propose an original method to detect it by exploiting crowd knowledge through gamification. We propose an adversarial game with a hidden purpose, where users are engaged in competitive roles: masking photos to prevent competitors recognizing the related event, and discovering events in photos masked by other players. Rules and incentives are defined to minimize cheating and force players to focus on details that really matter. A suitable algorithm composes the masks created by different players on the same media, thus producing a saliency map that, different from the traditional concept of saliency, does not focus on perceptual prominence but rather on event-related semantics of media. A thorough validation on public datasets is presented, and initial experiments to apply event saliency in detection tasks are proposed . Furthermore, an event-saliency dataset is disclosed to allow further research.},

Social bookmarking systems are an interesting example of this trend where users generate new contents. Unfortunately, the growing amount of available resources makes hard the task of accessing to relevant information in these environments. Recommender systems face this problem filtering relevant resources connected to users' interests and preferences. In particular, collaborative filtering recommender systems produce suggestions using the opinions of similar users, called the neighbors. The task of finding neighbors is difficult in environment such as social bookmarking systems, since bookmarked resources belong to different domains. In this paper we propose a methodology for partitioning users, tags and resources into domains of interest. Filtering tags and resources in accordance to the specific domains we can select a different set of neighbors for each domain, improving the accuracy of recommendations.},

  abstract = {With the increased presence of digital imaging devices, there also came an explosion in the amount of multimedia content available online. Users have transformed from passive consumers of media into content creators and have started organizing themselves in and around online communities. Flickr has more than 30 million users and over 3 billion photos, and many of them are tagged and public. One very important aspect in Flickr is the ability of users to organize in self-managed communities called groups. This paper examines an unexplored problem, which is jointly analyzing Flickr groups and users. We show that although users and groups are conceptually different, in practice they can be represented in a similar way via a bag-of-tags derived from their photos, which is amenable for probabilistic topic modeling. We then propose a probabilistic topic model representation learned in an unsupervised manner that allows the discovery of similar users and groups beyond direct tag-based strategies, and we demonstrate that higher-level information such as topics of interest are a viable alternative. On a dataset containing users of 10 000 Flickr groups and over 1 milion photos, we show how this common topic-based representation allows for a novel analysis of the groups-users Flickr ecosystem, which results into new insights about the structure of the entities in this social media source. We demonstrate novel practical applications of our topic-based representation, such as similarity-based exploration of entities, or single and multi-topic tag-based search, which address current limitations in the ways Flickr is used today.},

In the presented method, the ontology, including the domain concepts organized into hierarchies of categories and interconnected by relationships, as well as instances and connections among them, effectively becomes the classifier. Our method focuses on (i) converting a text document into a thematic graph of entities occurring in the document, (ii) ontological classification of the entities in the graph, and (iii) determining the overall categorization of the thematic graph, and as a result, the document itself. In the presented experiments, we used an RDF ontology constructed from the full English version of Wikipedia.

There are a large number of campaigns containing coordinated spam or promoting accounts in Twitter, which are more harmful than the traditional methods, such as email spamming. Since traditional solutions mainly check individual accounts or messages, it is an urgent task to detect spam and promoting campaigns in Twitter. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework to detect both spam and promoting campaigns. Our framework consists of three steps: firstly linking accounts who post URLs for similar purposes, secondly extracting candidate campaigns which may exist for spam or promoting purpose and finally distinguishing their intents. One salient aspect of the framework is introducing a URL-driven estimation method to measure the similarity between accounts' purposes of posting URLs, the other one is proposing multiple features to distinguish the candidate campaigns based on a machine learning method. Over a large-scale dataset from Twitter, we can extract the actual campaigns with high precision and recall and distinguish the majority of the candidate campaigns correctly.},

However, the huge amount of data available, along with the breadth of the user base, requires a substantial effort of information filtering to successfully drill down to relevant topics and events. Trending topic detection is therefore a fundamental building block to monitor and summarize information originating from social sources. There are a wide variety of methods and variables and they greatly affect the quality of results. We compare six topic detection methods on three Twitter datasets related to major events, which differ in their time scale and topic churn rate. We observe how the nature of the event considered, the volume of activity over time, the sampling procedure and the pre-processing of the data all greatly affect the quality of detected topics, which also depends on the type of detection method used. We find that standard natural language processing techniques can perform well for social streams on very focused topics, but novel techniques designed to mine the temporal distribution of concepts are needed to handle more heterogeneous streams containing multiple stories evolving in parallel. One of the novel topic detection methods we propose, based on -grams cooccurrence and topic ranking, consistently achieves the best performance across all these conditions, thus being more reliable than other state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract  = {Fuzzy ontology is a generalization of crisp ontology for modeling uncertain information and has been applied in recent years for supporting different activities of semantic web. However, there are great collections of crisp ontologies developed so far in various domains which are not appropriate for decision making in fuzzy environment. Accordingly, this paper aims at presenting an approach to automatically convert a crisp ontology to fuzzy ontology in the context of social networks. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that the combination of a learning process of crisp ontology with proposed approach, decreases computational complexity of fuzzy ontology learning due to breaking the task to two optimal steps. Accordingly, the approach allows for an advantageous application of various crisp clustering techniques in fuzzy ontology context.},

  abstract  = {Analysis of a customer's sensibility and preferences is an important strategy in a market that is becoming increasingly more customer oriented. In this paper, we propose the sensibility ergonomics design recommendation system using weather WebBot (DRS-WB). The proposed method applies sensibility ergonomics to increase the efficiency of merchandising for human-oriented sensible product designs. Development of DRS-WB used a user interface and collaborative filtering for the textile and fashion designs in order to satisfy the user's needs. Collaborative filtering was adopted in order to recommend designs of interest for users based on the predictive relationship discovered between the current user and other previous users. The today weather information is simultaneously acquired from the sensor based smartwear and the weather WebBot (Web Robot Agent). The weather WebBot uses a database of weather forecast information extracted from the web pages and RSS of the Korea Meteorological Administration and collects information from the various links off the main URL. And its signals are transmitted to the connected DRS-WB. It can be easily monitored in real time. We used 60 textile designs and 41 fashion designs in the survey questionnaire. The composition of the questionnaire is 17 sections for 6 designs on a page. 2,830,020 ratings were collected from 1,401 users. The pictures of fashion design details, such as collar type, sleeve type, skirt type, skirt length, and color tone were evaluated in terms of sensibility. Ultimately, this paper suggests empirical applications to verify the adequacy and the validity of this system.},

  abstract  = {This book outlines the basic principles of creation and maintenance of taxonomies and thesauri. It also provides step by step instructions for building a taxonomy or thesaurus and discusses the various ways to get started on a taxonomy construction project. Often, the first step is to get management and budgetary approval, so I start this book with a discussion of reasons to embark on the taxonomy journey. From there I move on to a discussion of metadata and how taxonomies and metadata are related, and then consider how, where, and why taxonomies are used. Information architecture has its cornerstone in taxonomies and metadata. While a good discussion of information architecture is beyond the scope of this work, I do provide a brief discussion of the interrelationships among taxonomies, metadata, and information architecture. Moving on to the central focus of this book, I introduce the basics of taxonomies, including a definition of vocabulary control and why it is so important, how i dexing and tagging relate to taxonomies, a few of the types of tagging, and a definition and discussion of post- and pre-coordinate indexing. After that I present the concept of a hierarchical structure for vocabularies and discuss the differences among various kinds of controlled vocabularies, such as taxonomies, thesauri, authority files, and ontologies. Once you have a green light for your project, what is the next step? Here I present a few options for the first phase of taxonomy construction and then a more detailed discussion of metadata and markup languages. I believe that it is important to understand the markup languages (SGML and XML specifically, and HTML to a lesser extent) in relation to information structure, and how taxonomies and metadata feed into that structure. After that, I present the steps required to build a taxonomy, from defining the focus, collecting and organizing terms, analyzing your vocabulary for even coverage over subject areas, filling in gaps, creatin relationships between terms, and applying those terms to your content. Here I offer a cautionary note: don’t believe that your taxonomy is “done!” Regular, scheduled maintenance is an important—critical, really—component of taxonomy construction projects. After you’ve worked through the steps in this book, you will be ready to move on to integrating your taxonomy into the workflow of your organization. This is covered in Book 3 of this series.

This paper presents a novel method that overcomes this problem by automatically generating an annotated corpus based on a specific ontology. Then the corpus was enriched with new and informative features extracted from Wikipedia data. Moreover, rather than pursuing rule-based methods as in literature, we employ a machine learning model to not only disambiguate but also identify named entities. In addition, our method explores in details the use of a range of features extracted from texts, a given ontology, and Wikipedia data for disambiguation. This paper also systematically analyzes impacts of the features on disambiguation accuracy by varying their combinations for representing named entities. Empirical evaluation shows that, while the ontology provides basic features of named entities, Wikipedia is a fertile source for additional features to construct accurate and robust named entity disambiguation systems.},

Blogosphere has no doubt the largest user-generated content repository full of knowledge. The potential of this knowledge is still to be explored. Knowledge discovery from this new genre is quite difficult and challenging as it is totally different from other popular genre of web-applications like World Wide Web (WWW). Blog-posts unlike web documents are small in size, thus lack in context and contain relaxed grammatical structures. Hence, standard text similarity measure fails to provide good results. In this paper, specialized requirements for comparing a pair of blog-posts is thoroughly investigated. Based on this we proposed a novel algorithm for sentence oriented semantic similarity measure of a pair of blog-posts. We applied this algorithm on a subset of political blogosphere of Pakistan, to cluster the blogs on different issues of political realm and to identify the influential bloggers.},

We then classify the applications of ontology based privacy protection into five types and conduct a comparison analysis on the respective ontologies for the five types of applications. At last, we explicitly analyze the ontologies in terms of their relationships to privacy protection and point out some shortcomings in the current research as well as some future research directions.},

So now a days Web Service discovery is an essential element in Service-Oriented Computing. But selecting appropriate web services for the benefits of service consumers is a key issue in service discovery. Web service discovery is based on service functionality and QoS. However, without Web service quality standards and quality-based discovery mechanisms, the trustworthiness of business-to-business interactions can't be guaranteed. Web service discovery spread up into these areas like agent, ontology, semantic, context server. But even though number of techniques, methods proposed for web service is always been a question. We have wide rage of QoS parameters but it is not easy to select the best one. So we are analyzing the QoS parameters and selecting the best service according to the user request.

Most conventional methods incorporate either a user profile or the item description, which cannot well utilize this kind of content information. Some other works jointly consider user ratings and reviews, but they are based on the factorization technique and have difficulty in providing explanations on generated recommendations. In this study, a coupled topic model (CoTM) for recommendation with UGC is developed. By combining UGC and ratings, the method discussed in this study captures both the content-based preferences and collaborative preferences and, thus, can explain both the user and item latent spaces using the topics discovered from the UGC. The learned topics in CoTM can also serve as proper explanations for the generated recommendations. Experimental results show that the proposed CoTM model yields significant improvements over the compared competitive methods on two typical datasets, that is, MovieLens-10M and Citation-network V1. The topics discovered by CoTM can be used not only to illustrate the topic distributions of users and items, but also to explain the generated user-item recommendations.},

The management and dissemination of news are not only faced with opportunities, but also faced many challenges. How to push the news and customized content to users timely and dynamically, so as to save the searching time, becomes a hot area of current research. A news correlation approach based on tags is proposed to provide users with a personalized news service. The system takes advantage of the network information crawling, web-based text mining and personalized recommendations technologies to realize automated extraction of news tag. The innovation of this mode is that the tag contains both categories and keywords. It contains a classification subject to the advantage of clustering, but also includes the theme of keywords intuitive expression. In other words, it matches the user's search habits. Thus, this system can improve the ability to retrieve and manage the news.},

  abstract  = {As a necessary part of our daily life, choose what dishes to cook that is a problem and troubles many people every day. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of multimedia recipe data on the Web 2.0 communities. To assist people to navigate and search on from large amounts of recipes, a suitable recipe model is crucial and indispensable. However, recipes have some distinct characteristics that conventional data models are inadequate to represent them for such data. For example, it is unreasonable and insufficient to measure how similar the cooking procedures of two dishes are only through text descriptions and/or their extracted terms. The main reason is that this raw data (or low-level features extracted from the raw data, e.g. term for text, color for image) do not map to the high-level semantics readily. In this paper, we argue that a recipe model should be semantic-based and behavior-oriented, preferably with domain knowledge support. A hybrid semantic item (HSI) model is next presented for addressing this problem. Based on HSI model, we devise a corresponding approach for recipe search by example. The experiment on our multimedia recipe retrieval system demonstrates that our HSI approach outperforms baseline methods.},

User-generated tags constitute an important source of information about a resource. To enable search scenarios exceeding traditional text-based search, such as exploratory and semantic search, this textual information must be complemented with semantic entities. Due to tag ambiguities and creative neologisms automatic semantic annotation based on user tags represents a major challenge. In this work, we show how to adopt context information and ontological knowledge to automatically assign semantic entities to user-generated tags for video data. Thus, a sophisticated semantic search on semantic entities is enabled. The algorithm combines co-occurence and link graph analysis using Linked Data. Also, a definition of context reliability in audio-visual content is described.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advancements have led to a deluge of data from distinctive domains (e.g., health care and scientific sensors, user-generated data, Internet and financial companies, and supply chain systems) over the past two decades. The term big data was coined to capture the meaning of this emerging trend. In addition to its sheer volume, big data also exhibits other unique characteristics as compared with traditional data. For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions. First, we present the definition of big data and discuss big data challenges. Next, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data systems into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics. These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities. In addition, we present the prevalent Hadoop framework for addressing big data challenges. Finally, we outline several evaluation benchmarks and potential research directions for big data systems.},

We describe a framework for personalized context-aware search of ontology-based tagged data. The tag ontology leverages additional information on data coming from a user and a resource, besides the tagged keyword, in order to augment search information. The framework uses general concepts taken from PeCMan, a personal content manager and GloServ, an ontology-based global service discovery system to implement the front-end and back-end of the overall system.},

This feedback is generally reported in the form of new issues for the project, managed by the so-called issue-trackers. One of the features provided by most issue-trackers is the possibility to define a set of labels/tags to classify the issues and, at least in theory, facilitate their management. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to confirm that taking the time to categorize new issues has indeed a beneficial impact on the project evolution. In this paper we analyze a population of more than three million of GitHub projects and give some insights on how labels are used in them. Our preliminary results reveal that, even if the label mechanism is scarcely used, using labels favors the resolution of issues. Our analysis also suggests that not all projects use labels in the same way (e.g., for some labels are only a way to prioritize the project while others use them to signal their temporal evolution as they move along in the development workflow). Further research is needed to precisely characterize these label “families” and learn more the ideal application scenarios for each of them.},

In particular, this paper presents a study on the conceptual modeling of meme complexes or memeplexes for more effective problem solving in the context of modern stochastic optimization. The memeplex representation, credit assignment criteria for meme coadaptation, and the role of emergent memeplexes in the lifetime learning process of a memetic algorithm in search are presented. A coadapted memetic algorithm that takes the proposed conceptual modeling of memeplexes into actions to solve capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs) of diverse characteristics is then designed. Results showed that adaptive memeplexes provide a means of creating highly robust, self-configuring, and scalable algorithms, thus generating improved or competitive results when benchmarking against several existing adaptive or human-designed state-of-the-art memetic algorithms and metaheuristics, on a plethora of CVRP sets considered.},

Same authors have shown elsewhere, that for same papers tags and bookmarks appear and gain volume very quickly in time as compared to citations and also hold good correlation with the citations. Studying the rank prediction models based on these systems gives advantage of gaining quick insight and localizing the highly productive and diffusible knowledge very early in time. This shows that it may be interesting to model the citation rank of a paper within the scope of a conference or journal issue, based on the bookmark counts (i-e count representing how many researchers have shown interest in a publication.) We used linear regression model for predicting citation ranks and compared both predicted citation rank models of bookmark counts and coauthor network counts for the papers of WWW06 conference. The results show that the rank prediction model based on bookmark counts is far better than the one based on coauthor network with mean absolute error for the first limited to the range of 5 and mean absolute error for second model above 18. Along with this we also compared the two bookmark prediction models out of which one was based on total citations rank as a dependent variable and the other was based on the adjusted citation rank. The citation rank was adjusted after subtracting the self and coauthor citations from total citations. The comparison reveals a significant improvement in the model and correlation after adjusting the citation rank. This may be interpreted that the bookmarking mechanisms represents the phenomenon similar to global discovery of a publication. While in the coauthor nets the papers are communicated personally and this communication or selection may not be captured within the bookmarking systems.},

Thus, at this moment learners and members of CoP are connected with their peers and share resources of common interest on different social networking sites and they communicate using technologies such as chats and forums. The main problem is that there is a scarcity of tools designed to analyze and support learners in this new context. In this context, we propose a set of tools that are intended to support learners interacting using chat, forum and social networking platforms.

In this method, each user is an active element of the system, he searches documents and he makes treatments to provide relevant information to other users in the Network. This is similar as the peer-to-peer systems; unlike that, an element (user) have to manage automatically his data by creating a short view model of his most visited documents, and calculates his relative relevance about each one. The relative relevance is variable according each user, so the final relevance is calculated by the averaging of the elementary relevance of all users. Hence, the name of collaborative relevance.},

  abstract  = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with modern sensors and sensor-based devices, will significantly stimulate the development of context-aware applications. An effective means to extract higher-level contextual information from sensor data is distributed complex event processing (CEP), which facilitates the analysis of real-time data streams coming from heterogeneous and distributed sources. Considering that user context is inherently sensitive information, the preservation of privacy is critical once the processing of user context takes place over several (possibly malicious) devices, especially in collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a trust-based approach for the placement and execution of CEP operators in a distributed environment. We propose a trust management model based on communication interactions among the users. Furthermore, we incorporate trust recommendations using a cosine-based similarity check in order to overcome collusion and on-off attacks. We developed a smartphone-based distributed CEP system called TrustCEP to evaluate our approach for trust management. Based on the evaluation of TrustCEP, we observe that our approach induces a minimal increase in average battery consumption compared to privacy-negligent approaches.},

  abstract  = {Many automated software engineering approaches, including code search, bug report categorization, and duplicate bug report detection, measure similarities between two documents by analyzing natural language contents. Often different words are used to express the same meaning and thus measuring similarities using exact matching of words is insufficient. To solve this problem, past studies have shown the need to measure the similarities between pairs of words. To meet this need, the natural language processing community has built WordNet which is a manually constructed lexical database that records semantic relations among words and can be used to measure how similar two words are. However, WordNet is a general purpose resource, and often does not contain software-specific words. Also, the meanings of words in WordNet are often different than when they are used in software engineering context. Thus, there is a need for a software-specific WordNet-like resource that can measure similarities of words. In this work, we propose an automated approach that builds a software-specific WordNet like resource, named WordSimSEDB, by leveraging the textual contents of posts in StackOverflow. Our approach measures the similarity of words by computing the similarities of the weighted co-occurrences of these words with three types of words in the textual corpus. We have evaluated our approach on a set of software-specific words and compared our approach with an existing WordNet-based technique (WordNetres) to return top-k most similar words. Human judges are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two techniques. We find that WordNetres returns no result for 55 % of the queries. For the remaining queries, WordNetres returns significantly poorer results.},

This paper proposes to boost focused crawling with four kinds of semantic models and semantic information, including thesauruses, categories, ontologies, and folksonomies. A statistical semantic association model is proposed to integrate different semantic models, represent heterogeneous semantic information, and support semantic relevance computation. A focused crawling framework is developed which adopts both keyword based contents and different kinds of additional information for relevance prediction and ranking.

We start by using quantitative methods that provide us an overall perspective, from which we can focus on specific segments of data that represent points of interest on which we apply qualitative methods that provide a more detailed perspective. Therefore, we begin our evaluation by using web analytics and advance towards the state of the art concept data analysis methods, like Formal Concept Analysis. The investigation has been conducted on a locally developed e-learning platform called PULSE. However, these methods can be applied to any other e-learning platform.},

  abstract  = {With the growing popularity of Web services, an increasing number of Web services have been integrated into and used by complex service oriented systems. As a result, the management of Web services has gained more importance as Web services management systems can provide useful service information to service consumers, developers and providers. However, current Web service management systems do not provide a holistic view of Web services. These management systems use independent information models covering different aspects of Web services, for instance, QoS, licensing, taxonomy information, to name just a few. In this paper, we address the challenges of (1) integrating available information into a common Web service information model, while (2) providing an extensible information model, and at the same time, (3) keeping track of Web services changes and (4) offering means for complex analysis of Web services. We introduce a Service Evolution Management Framework (SEMF) that addresses the aforementioned challenges using a generic Web service information model. We illustrate how we utilize our proposed Web service information model to manage changes of Web services, and present a case study that shows how our framework could be used in practice.},

The goal of Web search personalization is to retrievce the search results to a particular user depends on that user's preferences. These data allows the users not only to facilitate and share the data, but to afford information and improve media retrieval and management. One such examples is personalized image retrieval where user's explicit information is considered to produce exact images using re-ranking results. In this paper, the Tag-Annotation based approach by Re-ranking (TAD-RR) is proposed to generate personalized images. The basic assertion is to collect the images from the user and store it in a database with appropriate tag and annotation. Thereby, semantic search is developed to compare the query with dictionary to find out the relevant tag name. The images are then found from the database by applying TAD-RR procedures. Finally, page refreshing is handled at the time of image downloading. If a particular image is downloaded, the demand will be increased for that image in the server and the page gets reloaded based on the retrieved image annotation by ranking similarly. The experimental results show that the proposed approach accurately retrieves the personalized images.},

They can be used for navigation, browsing, recommendation and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, which is based on social networks. The social network is established among users and items, taking into account both the information of ratings and tags. We consider users' co-tagging behaviors and add the similarity relationship to the graph to enhance the performance. Our algorithm is based on the Random Walk with Restarts but provides a more natural and efficient way to represent social networks. Having considered the influence of tags, the transition matrix is denser and the recommendation is more accurate. By evaluating our new algorithm and comparing it to the baseline algorithm which is used in many real world recommender systems on a real life dataset, we make the conclusion that our method performs better than the baseline method.},

An initial population of the central repository is automated using Yahoo! contextual search services. The collected data is organized using semantic web technologies so that the data can be more easily shared and used for innovative analyses. A prototype has demonstrated the capability of the approach.},

We propose to resolve this problem by exploring, experimentally, new ways of inferring knowledge from past IDE-interactions, and of maximizing collaboration among developers. Our approach, called Adinda, revolves around transforming the IDE into a set of integrated services, accessible via a web browser, and enriched with Web 2.0 technologies. Such services will not only help developers perform traditional IDE tasks, but also facilitate the required informal communication and collaboration needs of software development projects. In this paper, we report on our vision, approach and challenges for building Adinda, and initial results.},

In this paper, we explore a machine learning side of this work direction. We propose a novel technique for decentralized estimation of probabilistic mixture models, which are among the most versatile generative models for understanding data sets. More precisely, we demonstrate how to estimate a global mixture model from a set of local models. Our approach accommodates dynamic topology and data sources and is statistically robust, i.e. resilient to the presence of unreliable local models. Such outlier models may arise from local data which are outliers, compared to the global trend, or poor mixture estimation.

Semantic-enabled requirements engineering (SRE) for developing service-oriented applications helps to transform disordered users' needs into ordered requirement specifications. It facilitates requirements acquisition with multiple stakeholders' participation. It further enhances semantic-conducted services aggregation and eventually provides customized service productions according to process semantics of requirements. This paper concentrates on user-centric service customization with a paradigm shift from classical provider-centric service provision to user-centric active service production. Subscription and pushing technology of ATOM/RSS is adopted to actively push users' needs to service providers. Semantic description of service requirements is proposed, and characterizes in identifying process (workflow) and service.

Moreover, most of the previous works assume that the labels provided by the human oracles are noise free, which may often be violated in reality. We present a collaborative computational model for active learning with multiple human oracles. It leads to not only an ensemble kernel machine that is robust to label noises, but also a principled label quality measure to online detect irresponsible labelers. Instead of running independent active learning processes for each individual human oracle, our model captures the inherent correlations among the labelers through shared data among them. Our simulation experiments and experiments with real crowd-sourced noisy labels demonstrated the efficacy of our model.},

Web-based collaborations and cross-organizational processes typically require dynamic and context-based interactions between people and services. However, finding the right partner to work on joint tasks or to solve emerging problems in such scenarios is challenging due to scale (number of involved people and services) and the temporary nature of collaborations. Furthermore, actor skills and competencies evolve over time requiring dynamic approaches for the management of actor properties. Web services and SOA are the ideal technical framework to automate interactions spanning people and services. In this paper, we present a novel discovery mechanism based on social trust to support formation and dynamic interactions in service-oriented collaboration networks. We argue that trust between members is essential for successful collaborations. Here we discuss profile similarity-based link establishment to connect disparate network segments.},

The practice of tagging is done in a collective environment. Folksonomies are self constructed, based on co-occurrence of definitions, rather than a hierarchical structure of the data. The downside of this was that a few sites and applications are able to successfully exploit the sharing of bookmarks. The need for tools that are able to resolve the ambiguity of the definitions is becoming urgent as the need of simple instruments for their visualization, editing and exploitation in web applications still hinders their diffusion and wide adoption. An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces. To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called " Folksodriven" is used in this paper. While it is presented the Folks driven Structure Network (FSN) to resolve the ambiguity of definitions of folksonomy tags suggestions for the user.

For example, out-dated data can be used as such related data. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning framework for training neural network (NN) ensembles. The framework has two key features: 1) it uses the well-known negative correlation learning to train an ensemble of diverse neural networks from the related data, fully discovering the knowledge in the data; and 2) a penalized incremental learning scheme is used to adapt the neural networks obtained from negative correlation learning to the training data for the targeted learning task. The adaptation is guided by reference neural networks that measure the relatedness between the training and the related data. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that our framework can achieve classification accuracy competitive to existing ensemble transfer learning methods such as TrAdaBoost and TrBagg. We discuss some characteristics of our framework observed in the experiment and the scenarios under which the framework may have superior performance.},

  abstract  = {In current Android systems, the application recommendation function is an important feature that users can use to find a similar application to replace a targeted one. The current recommendation system provided through Google and the Google Play store presumably recommends applications similar to a target application while accounting for the popularity of each application. However, it does not take the security features of each application or users preferences into consideration when doing so. In this paper, we propose DroidVisor, an Android tool that provides users with fine-grained and customizable application recommendations. Compared to the Google store recommendation function, DroidVisor does not only use the similarity to a preselected target application, but also considers other metrics such as popularity, security, and usability. More specifically, DroidVisor provides an interface for users to configure the weight of each metric and a recommendation algorithm that generates a list of recommended applications based on the combined scores. We evaluate our proposed criteria and the quality of recommendation through use case studies. Finally, we present our findings through a discussion of accuracy as well as possible ways to improve our recommendation results.},

The design allows users to create food entries either via a traditional database lookup or a streamlined '+1' approach. 24 people used POND to create predefined food entries. We found people preferred different approaches to creating entries, which reflected their self-reported nutrition concerns. This supports an argument for rethinking traditional approaches to designing food diaries.},

  abstract  = {The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming data.},

  abstract  = {As a social bookmark tool, Folksonomy gives high freedom to users and allows users to share and notate resources. However, many tags applied arbitrarily by users can not really reflect the contents of web pages and lead to ineffectiveness in information retrieval. Moreover, there are still some important tasks about how to eliminate ambiguity more easily and recommend more interested web pages to users. To resolve the above problems, we propose a novel mechanism named SSTAG, and it can recommend a set of Super-tags to users for their choices based on keywords input. As various topics related to the keywords, the Super-tags are selected from different clusters of web pages related to the keywords. A user chooses a Super-tag, which means the user may have chosen an interested topic, and then some more detailed tags in the topic are recommended as Sub-tags. The relationship between Super-tag and Sub-tag is just like navigation and positioning. Likewise, the user can choose one Sub-tag and submit it with the Super-tag. By means of the user's choice, this system can capture users' preference and recommend a series of related web pages. We employ a real world dataset to examine the mechanism, and the experimental results show that this mechanism can eliminate ambiguity efficiently and recommend a set of appropriate tags.},

This frame work was tested in a sample of 408 participants, who indicated their musical preferences using a genre-based measure and free textual responses. A comparison of both forms of data suggested that a genre-based measure can be reliably re covered from the free responses using the framework.

These resources are represented with an envelope composed of many references that point to other contents (whole or portions of) within the Internet. This envelope holds only references where multimedia portions, called fragments, are located and they are stored as a meta-data. In such a way, the Authoring System prevents multimedia element duplications.

It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results.},

Then, we specially adjust and optimize these methods to produce better results. Then, we exploit rank aggregation approaches to integrate these basic models to form hybrid recommenders. We experiment our methods on Lastfm dataset. And by solid experiments, our proposed hybrid models achieve optimal recommendation accuracy leveraged by the superiority of sub-models.},

Cognitive heuristics are the mental models used in cognitive psychology to describe how human brains efficiently process the huge amount of information constantly coming from the environment around us. As personal mobile devices represent proxies in the cyber world of their human users, we investigate how the same cognitive heuristics can be used by mobile devices to become self-aware of the features of the physical environment around their users. Specifically, we assume that physical locations are described as a network of tags. We consider a self-organising opportunistic network environment, where devices exchange information when meeting directly. We propose algorithms based on cognitive heuristics through which users' nodes obtain tags either directly when coming in proximity of locations, or indirectly through other nodes they meet. We analyse the properties of the networks of tags resulting at individual nodes, as they emerge from this process, as a function of various cognitive parameters. We show that using cognitive heuristics leads, under the same resource constraints, to much more effective information diffusion with respect to other reference solutions. Interestingly, we find critical thresholds for key parameters that discriminate between information diffusion and information loss. Finally, we show that, despite resource constraints, the structure of the network of tags at individual nodes is remarkably close to the ideal that would be obtained with infinite resources.},

  abstract = {Users can enjoy personalized services provided by various context-aware applications that collect users' contexts through sensor-equipped smartphones. Meanwhile, serious privacy concerns arise due to the lack of privacy preservation mechanisms. Currently, most mechanisms apply passive defense policies in which the released contexts from a privacy preservation system are always real, leading to a great probability with which an adversary infers the hidden sensitive contexts about the users. In this paper, we apply a deception policy for privacy preservation and present a novel technique, FakeMask, in which fake contexts may be released to provably preserve users' privacy. The output sequence of contexts by FakeMask can be accessed by the untrusted context-aware applications or be used to answer queries from those applications. Since the output contexts may be different from the original contexts, an adversary has greater difficulty in inferring the real contexts. Therefore, FakeMask limits what adversaries can learn from the output sequence of contexts about the user being in sensitive contexts, even if the adversaries are powerful enough to have the knowledge about the system and the temporal correlations among the contexts. The essence of FakeMask is a privacy checking algorithm which decides whether to release a fake context for the current context of the user. We present a novel privacy checking algorithm and an efficient one to accelerate the privacy checking process. Extensive evaluation experiments on real smartphone context traces of users demonstrate the improved performance of FakeMask over other approaches.},

There are growing needs to get useful information from Twitter, because an enormous amount of information is transmitted in real time. Twitter users, who play an important role as information sources, typically transmit information about some particular topics which they are interested in. Therefore, to identify useful information, it is very important to know which topics a user tends to transmit. In this paper, we propose a method to discover appropriate topics for a user by using Twitter list. Twitter list is an official functionality to make a"user list, " list members tend to transmit information about the topic represented in the name of the list. From this observation, our idea is to extract tags from list names, and exploit the relationship among lists, tags extracted from the list names, and list members. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We present the results of an exploratory case-study investigating the tagging and citing practices for the WWW `06 conference papers. We observed two important patterns: (1) Papers which got heavily tagged in all three applications Delicious, Citeulike and Bibsonomy (average total tags > 6) generally achieved a high number of citations. We also observed that most of the tags were from 2006 and most of the citations were from 2007. This indicated that tags may hold the potential of foretelling the future volume of regenerative diffusion of research. (2) Terms appearing in tag-clouds of highly tagged papers in 2006 reappear frequently in the titles of respective citing papers in 2007. This shows that tag clouds may have the potential of forecasting the context of diffusion as well. It furthermore indicates that the users tag the papers with multiple tags according to their specific contexts of use as well as content of that knowledge artifact. Based on these patterns we propose that tags may be used as a supplementary indicator to model the diffusion of knowledge on Web.},

The solution that we propose in this paper is a platform called Edu3R (Educational Resources Retrieval and Recommendation), which relies on community filtering: students enrolled in the same course can perform collaborative search through various learning object repositories, bookmark the resources of interest, rate them and share them with peers. The rationale is that resources found and selected by peers are likely to be relevant since the learning community is centered around the same course and the same learning tasks and is relatively homogeneous (classmates generally having common learning backgrounds and completing the same curriculum). Edu3R also relies on social tagging, through which learners annotate resources with meaningful terms that reflect the educational context, provide a personalized classification and facilitate subsequent retrieval. Finally, Edu3R also integrates a collaborative filtering mechanism for recommending learning resources based on student similarity. The paper provides an overview of the system architecture, functionalities and pedagogical rationale, as well as a comparison with similar platforms.},

The model adopts a probabilistic topic model to separately represent external word-topic and internal word-concept relations. These representations are coupled with a tag-based topic inference process that predicts how existing tags may influence the semantic interpretation of a document. The inferred topics influence the choice of tags assigned to a document through a random utility model of tag choices. We show that the model is successful in explaining the stability in tag proportions across time and power-law frequency-rank distributions of tag co-occurrences for semantically general and narrow tags. The model also generates novel predictions on how emergent behavioral patterns may change when users with different domain expertise interact with a social tagging system. The model demonstrates the weaknesses of single-level analyses and highlights the importance of adopting a multi-level modeling approach to explain online social behavior.},

  abstract  = {Large enterprise systems need continuous monitoring at infrastructure, application and business levels to detect and prevent problem situations. Traditionally, automated monitoring solutions are programmed once at setup based on a set of well-defined monitoring objectives and handed over to the operations team. Such solutions have underlying data models that are often complex and semantically rich but in stable environments, this complexity is generally hidden from the operations team, who only need to make minor configuration changes (e.g. setting thresholds) as and when required. However, the situation is now rapidly changing with enterprise data centers being subject to continuous transformations as new software, hardware and process components get deployed or updated. This puts an immense burden on monitoring activity because not only thousands of different parameters need to get monitored but the addition and modification of service level objectives (SLOs) may happen continuously. We describe a monitoring system architecture which simplifies the task of authoring and managing SLOs in such dynamic and heterogeneous environments. At the heart of our approach is a lightweight and extensible data model that is derived from more complex configuration models, so as to only expose data relevant for monitoring to the operations team. Simple string-tags derived from this model are then used to label SLOs and associated data streams. The approach localizes programming to the data-sensor layer and makes authoring simpler than the specification of objects in an alternate richer but complex object-oriented representation. We also describe a tag-driven real-time visualization tool that can organize data streams using their accompanying tags and ease user navigation through large volumes of monitoring data.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Information and communication technology is now being increasingly employed in libraries and information centers for improving organization and dissemination of information. Many of the activities, which were earlier being done manually, have now been automated. Besides, a sizeable amount of information sources are now available in electronic or digital format, and Internet has become an important source of information. Not only the existing libraries and their services are now being automated, libraries of new varieties, such as digital libraries and virtual libraries are also coming up. The main areas where efforts are being made to apply computers for increasing the efficiency and speed in the field of information organization are indexing; abstracting; information retrieval tools like thesaurus, ontology, folksonomy, and folksontology; translation; and language processing. These efforts have been briefly discussed in this chapter. },

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on some of the most prominent technical mechanisms, including Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), tagging, and mash-ups, that are commonly attributed to Web 2.0 developments and in particular to Web 2.0 services. \{RIAs\} can be built using several Web development frameworks. \{RIAs\} exist for a broad variety of functions (e.g., for personal information management or for office applications including the writing of documents or the execution of spreadsheet calculations). These online applications allow for a kind of functionality and interactivity that have so far been exclusively reserved for desktop applications; they can hence be considered as a materialization of the network computer (i.e., the “NC” as opposed to the PC, the personal computer) that had first been predicted in the mid-1990s. Several \{RIAs\} are described to show their characteristics. Mash-ups, roughly implement the idea of bringing multiple services or sources of content together in one place in order to form a new, often valued-added service. One example of mash-ups is Google Maps, a service from which map information can be obtained in order to mash it up, say, with textual address information in order to make it more lively and visual. Through tagging, i.e., user-generated keywords or metadata attachable to Web resources. This allows users to attach any number of keywords to an object or a Web resource, which could be an entire Web site, a photo, or a link. This is meant to ease their storing of and searching through these objects. },

However, most research focused on the evaluation and development of appropriate methods rather than tackling the practical challenges of how to integrate recommendation methods into real tagging systems, record and evaluate their performance. In this paper we describe the tag recommendation framework we developed for our social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. With the intention to develop, test, and evaluate recommendation algorithms and supporting cooperation with researchers, we designed the framework to be easily extensible, open for a variety of methods, and usable independent from BibSonomy. Furthermore, this paper presents a first evaluation of two exemplarily deployed recommendation methods. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems (CTS) enable Internet users to annotate for resources using custom tags, and the tags reflect the user interest and thus form a user profile. However, the flexibility of tagging brings large number of synonymous and polysemous tags which make the use of these profile information to personalize resource recommendation difficult. We propose to use graph-based clustering to form groups of semantically-related tags in the offline stage. Then in the online stage the tag clusters act as an intermediary between users and resource and are utilized to personalize the query results in CTS. 5-fold cross-validation is performed on two data sets, the results are compared with two other algorithms. Results show that the algorithm proposed demonstrate much better personalization measured by the F-value, whilst the effect is more miraculous in a multi-topic than in a single-topic CTS. This observation suggests that in a multi-topic CTS tag clustering such as proposed in this paper is an important strategy.},

Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label products in a collection using a free vocabulary. The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users. This experience showed that TagProfiles are easier to understand and modify by users, allowing them to discover new movies as they interact with their profiles.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user’s preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems.

Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD.

By investigating the dynamics of tagging process, we find that high frequency tags almost cover the main aspects of a resource content and can be determined stable much earlier than a whole tag set. Motivated by this finding, we design the swapping index and smart moving index on tagging quality. We also study the correlations in tag usage and propose the semantic measurement on tagging quality. The proposed methods are evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient than previous methods, which are appropriate for a large number of web resources. The effectiveness is justified by the results in tag based applications. The light weight metrics bring a little loss on the performance, while the semantic metric is better than current methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

  abstract      = {As an example of exploring human memory cue use in an ecologically valid context, we present ongoing work to examine the “memory cue hypothesis” in collaborative tagging. In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract        = {In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of user-generated data in collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy-based) systems due to the prevailing of Web 2.0 communities. To effectively assist users to find their desired resources, it is critical to understand user behaviors and preferences. Tag-based profile techniques, which model users and resources by a vector of relevant tags, are widely employed in folksonomy-based systems. This is mainly because that personalized search and recommendations can be facilitated by measuring relevance between user profiles and resource profiles. However, conventional measurements neglect the sentiment aspect of user-generated tags. In fact, tags can be very emotional and subjective, as users usually express their perceptions and feelings about the resources by tags. Therefore, it is necessary to take sentiment relevance into account into measurements. In this paper, we present a novel generic framework SenticRank to incorporate various sentiment information to various sentiment-based information for personalized search by user profiles and resource profiles. In this framework, content-based sentiment ranking and collaborative sentiment ranking methods are proposed to obtain sentiment-based personalized ranking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of integrating sentiment information to address the problem of the personalized tag-based search in collaborative tagging systems. Moreover, we compare the proposed sentiment-based personalized search with baselines in the experiments, the results of which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we study the influences by popular sentiment dictionaries, and SenticNet is the most prominent knowledge base to boost the performance of personalized search in folksonomy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

From parent’s perspective, the ideal scenario would be one in which they could dynamically decide about the suitability of any content. Since this desired scenario entails many practical problems, we propose an intermediate solution where parents delegate the decision of blocking any piece of TV content on a trustworthy set of parents. Our approach provides a collaborative parental control model based on two pillar: (1) a parenting social network where parents interact, freely give their opinion about TV content and tag this content (collaborative tagging); and (2) a model of trust relationship between parents. Regarding the deployment of parental control, we introduce a parental monitoring system for DVB-IPTV content, which is based on social technologies. The proposal combines information from the service provider and from parents in a social network to predict whether content should be blocked. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Dialogues are created by the interaction between people, who speak different kinds of topics using natural language. Task-oriented dialogue aims the solution of a given task in a given domain. Folksonomies are knowledge structures composed of users, tags and resources. Folksonomies emerge from the tagging process in collaborative tagging systems. Dialogues and folksonomies have in common their social dimension. One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process. This can be useful for instance, to retrieve the topics addressed by the interlocutors of the dialogues, in different time intervals. Experiments with a real-world task-oriented dialogue corpus were done.},

  abstract        = {Social tags take an important role in exploratory search. In collaborative tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources with tags. The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Enriching the list of recommended spots with contextual information such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts etc. may further add value to the systems. This paper proposes the concept of information enrichment for a tourist spot recommender system. Proposed system works in collaboration with a Tourist Spot Recommender System, takes the list of spots to be recommended to the current user and collects the current contextual information for those spots. A new score/rank is computed for each spot to be recommender based on the recommender’s rank and current context and sent back to the user. Contextual information may be collected by several techniques such as sensors, collaborative tagging (folksonomy), crowdsourcing etc. This paper proposes an approach for information enrichment using just in time location aware crowdsourcing. Location aware crowdsourcing is used to get current contextual information about a spot from the crowd currently available at that spot. Most of the contextual parameters such as traffic conditions, weather conditions, crowdedness etc. are fuzzy in nature and therefore, fuzzy inference is proposed to compute a new score/rank, with each recommended spot. The proposed system may be used with any spot recommender system, however, in this work a personalized tourist spot recommender system is considered as a case for study and evaluation. A prototype system has been implemented and is evaluated by 104 real users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The problems which occur during the process are analyzed and solutions are proposed. The structure of the folksonomy is also analyzed. It turns out to be a social network graph. Graph features, such as the path length, or the Jaccard similarity coefficient, are the input parameters for a machine learning classifying algorithm. The comparative importance of the parameters is evaluated. Finally, the method was evaluated in the RUSSE evaluation campaign. The results are lower than most results for distribution-based vector models. However, the model itself is cheaper to build. The failures of the models are analyzed and possible improvements are suggested.},

A variety of automatic and semi-automatic methods exist for extracting or assigning identity to online resources. Although users’ perception about contents and also their interests might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects and always recommend them to the users based on their fixed, defined identities because they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our approach, we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of users related to them in a social semantic tagging system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects.

  abstract        = {With the advent of the so-called "Web 2.0", the participatory nature of many of its applications has nurtured the vision of many researchers to finally overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck inherent to many Semantic Web applications. Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

Nowadays, collaborative labeling has grown in reputation on the web, on sites that permit users to label bookmarks, photographs and other details. It has been recently become useful and well known as one effective way of classifying items for future search, sharing information, and filtering. So, as to predict the future search of users, we propose a novel collaborative tagging-based page recommendation algorithm using fuzzy classifier. The method consists of three phases: Grouping, Rule Generation Phase and Page Recommendation Phase. In the proposed method, we calculate the resemblance of users in selecting tags and thereby, calculate the nearest neighbors of each user and cluster them. Then, the priority of tags and items for each user is calculated for constructing a Nominal Label Matrix and Nominal Page Matrix. Finally, the fuzzy rules are generated for page recommendation. The experimentation is carried out on delicious datasets and the experimental results ensured that the proposed algorithm has achieved the maximum hit ratio of 6.6% for neighborhood size of 20, which is higher than the existing technique which obtained only 5.5%. © 2014, Copyright: the authors.},

  abstract        = {The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three components, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this paper, we develop a dual mining framework to explore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design four sets of efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the dataset, showed that the users' reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants - in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user's choice of resources, and sharing styles. Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a "gain scale" of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.},

  abstract      = {Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Background: The public typically believes psychotherapy to be more effective than pharmacotherapy for depression treatments. This is not consistent with current scientific evidence, which shows that both types of treatment are about equally effective. Objective: The study investigates whether this bias towards psychotherapy guides online information search and whether the bias can be reduced by explicitly providing expert information (in a blog entry) and by providing tag clouds that implicitly reveal experts' evaluations. Methods: A total of 174 participants completed a fully automated Web-based study after we invited them via mailing lists. First, participants read two blog posts by experts that either challenged or supported the bias towards psychotherapy. Subsequently, participants searched for information about depression treatment in an online environment that provided more experts' blog posts about the effectiveness of treatments based on alleged research findings. These blogs were organized in a tag cloud; both psychotherapy tags and pharmacotherapy tags were popular. We measured tag and blog post selection, efficacy ratings of the presented treatments, and participants' treatment recommendation after information search. Results: Participants demonstrated a clear bias towards psychotherapy (mean 4.53, SD 1.99) compared to pharmacotherapy (mean 2.73, SD 2.41; t173=7.67, P<.001, d=0.81) when rating treatment efficacy prior to the experiment. Accordingly, participants exhibited biased information search and evaluation. This bias was significantly reduced, however, when participants were exposed to tag clouds with challenging popular tags. Participants facing popular tags challenging their bias (n=61) showed significantly less biased tag selection (F2,168=10.61, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.112), blog post selection (F2,168=6.55, P=.002, partial eta squared=0.072), and treatment efficacy ratings (F2,168=8.48, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.092), compared to bias-supporting tag clouds (n=56) and balanced tag clouds (n=57). Challenging (n=93) explicit expert information as presented in blog posts, compared to supporting expert information (n=81), decreased the bias in information search with regard to blog post selection (F1,168=4.32, P=.04, partial eta squared=0.025). No significant effects were found for treatment recommendation (Ps>.33). Conclusions: We conclude that the psychotherapy bias is most effectively attenuated-and even eliminated-when popular tags implicitly point to blog posts that challenge the widespread view. Explicit expert information (in a blog entry) was less successful in reducing biased information search and evaluation. Since tag clouds have the potential to counter biased information processing, we recommend their insertion. © Holly O Witteman.},

  abstract        = {Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

  abstract        = {With the development of the Internet, there are more and more shared resources on the Web. Personalized search becomes increasingly important as users demand higher retrieval quality. Personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags (features) and thus provide a powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. To capture and understand user preferences, a user is typically modeled as a vector of tag:value pairs (i.e., a tag-based user profile) in collaborative tagging systems. In such a tag-based user profile, a user's preference degree on a group of tags (i.e., a combination of several tags) mainly depends on the preference degree on every individual tag in the group. However, the preference degree on a combination of tags (a tag-group) cannot simply be obtained from linearly combining the preference on each tag. The combination of a user's two favorite tags may not be favorite for the user. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To overcome their problems, we model a user profile based on combinations of tags (tag-groups) and then apply it to the personalized search. By comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results on a real data set shows the effectiveness of our proposed user profile method.

Historically, the popular song has been classified as a subcategory of other musical objects. However, recent researches show that the popular song is a specific artistic form that is endowed with its own language and, therefore, demands specific techniques for analysis, representation and, consequently, classification. Considering the different approaches toward popular songs in catalogues and contemporary systems, this paper identifies possible solutions, such as the use of descriptive metadata, the use of collaborative tagging or the creation of an ontology. In discussing the construction of an epistemological foundation used specifically for classifying the popular song, we reflect on the remaining challenges for the knowledge organization of complex artistic documents.},

  abstract      = {User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.

In this paper, we adapt the notion of folksonomy to the collaborative tagging of Web APIs, that is, software components made available by third parties through web interfaces in order to aggregate them and compose web mashups. In this context, we will motivate the use of this tool and we will discuss the differences to model the mashup space as a folksonomy with respect to the traditional use of folksonomies in the Web 2.0. The folksonomy of Web APIs we will describe is modeled to be fully compliant with existing and commonly used public Web API repositories. It is not intended to substitute them, but to complement their contents in order to enable advanced Web API search facilities according to different perspectives. © 2013 ACM.},

However, as tags are freely chosen by users, the vocabularies are diverse, ambiguous and sometimes only meaningful to individuals. Tag recommenders may assist users during tagging process. Its objective is to suggest relevant tags to use as well as to help consolidating vocabulary in the systems. In this paper we discuss our approach for providing personalized tag recommendation by making use of existing domain ontology generated from folksonomy. Specifically we evaluated the approach in sparse situation. The evaluation shows that the proposed ontology-based method has improved the accuracy of tag recommendation in this situation.},

However, the (offine) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from dificulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets. We show, that a recommender's performance depends on the particular core and explore correlations between performances on different cores. © 2013 ACM.},

Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

However, the simplistic and user-centered design of this kind of systems cause the task of finding personally interesting users is becoming quite out of reach for the common user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation. This is because CF always been attack by malicious users that will make it suffers in finding the truly interesting users. With this problem in mind, this study proposes a hybrid User Trust method to enhance CF in order to increase accuracy of user recommendation in social tagging system. This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. In addition, it indicated that the hybrid method give more accurate recommendation than the existing CF based on user trust. © 2013 Science Publications.},

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on the tag-group effect, namely, TGER. This algorithm utilizes the user ratings on resources to select the tag-groups which have significant effects on the user's preference, and adopts the high-dimension tag-group first matching method to calculate the user-resource relevance. Experimental results on the MovieLens data set show that TGER can significantly improve the recommendation quality.},

In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources.

To enhance the performance of personalized service recommendation in collaborative tagging systems, not only tag information but also time and social relations information should be considered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method aiming at taking advantage of tag, time and users' social relations information for a preferable service recommendation. We first improve a simple tag-based recommendation method by a time-decay function. Then we develop a temporal social-based recommendation method which analyzes user familiarity and user preference similarity between friends. Based on these two steps we integrate them as a temporal tag-and social-based (TTS) recommendation algorithm. Experiment results indicate that our method outperforms general tag-based and social-based recommendation methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

This paper proposes the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (IFAHC) algorithm for recommendation using social tagging. The Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) concept is used to represent tag values which are vague and uncertain. IFAHC can cluster items represented by using IFS into different groups.

A method based on the tripartite model (actors, concepts and instances) induces from social applications a folksonomy related to a domain of knowledge. The hypothesis of this paper is that if folksonomies are shared conceptualizations, then using them in conceptual modeling should reduce the number of divergences between actors when they elicit terms to be part of a model (a concept map in this article). A controlled experiment of conceptual modeling was performed with experimental groups who received tags inducted from data of categorizations from Delicious and control groups who received terms extracted from Web pages categorized on Delicious. The results show that the experimental groups obtained less divergences (on average) in elicitation of terms when compared to control groups. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

But sometimes it is also used as a way to express opinions, which is normally done through rating-or text review systems. This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies. © 2013 IEEE.},

The system offers users by recommending learning materials, tutors, or other learners with common interests combining users' social tags from external social network and tags about learning materials from autologous collaborative tagging system. A Rules Engine is used to manage a set of rules for each user to achieve personalized recommendation. The rules which define the relationship between tags construct the relationship graph model for users and learning resources thus graph-based collaborative filtering recommendation methods can be implemented.

  abstract        = {Tags can be used to annotate resources on the web. This enables users to share or browse the resources or retrieve them in future. Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably, the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the noise. Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with three-mode tensors, in order to capture the three-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multiway analysis, latent correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Moreover, a hybrid scheme is proposed that additionally considers content-based information that is extracted from items. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Last.fm), against both recent tag-aware and traditional (non tag aware) item recommendation algorithms indicates significant improvements in recommendation quality. Moreover, the experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid scheme. © 2011 IEEE.},

Our system enriches the navigational capabilities of standard tagging systems, which typically exploit only popularity and co-occurrence data. We describe a prototype that leverages the Wikipedia category structure to allow a user to semantically navigate pages from the Delicious social bookmarking service. In our system a user can perform an ordinary keyword search and browse relevant pages but is also given the ability to broaden the search to more general topics and narrow it to more specific topics. We show that Treelicious indeed provides an intuitive framework that allows for improved and effective discovery of knowledge. © 2010 IEEE.},

Data from social sources such as Delicious, Flickr, Technorati and Twitter provide an outside view of the domain and help incorporate external knowledge into the ontology learning process. The neural network technique of spreading activation is used to identify relevant new concepts, and to determine their positions in the extended ontology. Evaluating the method with two measures (PMI and expert judgements) demonstrates the significant benefits of social evidence sources for ontology learning. © 2010 IEEE.},

State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2 . Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. ©2010 IEEE.},

Attackers may attempt to distort the system's adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. Prior work on recommender systems has shown that studying different attack types, their properties and their impact, can help identify robust algorithms that make these systems more secure and less vulnerable to manipulation. Unlike traditional recommender systems, a tagging system includes multiple retrieval algorithms to facilitate browsing of resources, users and tags. The challenge is, therefore, evaluating the impact of various types of attacks across different navigation options. In this paper we develop a framework for characterizing attacks against tagging systems. We then propose a methodology for evaluating their global impact based on PageRank. Using real data from a popular tagging systems, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of several attack types. Our results help us understand how much effort is needed from an attacker to change the behavior of a tagging system and which attack types are more successful against such systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

This would allow using them for calculating semantic distance between resources. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed a large amount of data downloaded from del.icio.us. To this end, we developed an algorithm for searching 'similar' URLs based on the similarity of their aggregated tag vectors, which allowed us to identify clusters of similar resources. Our experimental findings demonstrate that massive tagging of resources leads to resource meanings that are defined bottom-up, and they prove the effectiveness of collaborative tagging systems for describing resources. © 2008 IEEE.},

Semantic web technologies provide a new way to annotating and retrieving images. We address the problems of both folksonomy and semantic web annotation systems for image retrieval in particular and argue that this can be improved by giving meanings to users' tags. This paper considers using both minimized domain-specific ontology and generic ontology. We show how less detailed ontologies can help end users to annotate and search with the simple user interface. Our prototype system has the capability to describe the semantics for contents of an image. Also, no previous extra work to create instances according to the ontology for later annotations is needed. © 2008 IEEE.},

One way to overcome such problem is to build personalized recommender systems to retrieve product information that really interests the customers. The rapid development of Web 2.0 provides new ideas for personalized recommendation. In this paper we introduce the collaborative filtering, knowledge-based approaches and hybrid approaches in building recommender systems and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, we propose a collaborative tagging system to provide personalized product information to customers in B2C e-commerce websites and describe the system's architecture and point the system's advantage. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Tagging is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 web sites. A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {As the number of Web services dramatically increases, it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for user to find the desired Web services. Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between cooccurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {With ubiquitous access to Web 2.0 applications, users on social networks can now collaboratively author and share hypermedia learning resources, contributing to more engaging learning experiences in Technology-Enhanced Learning outside formal education. Though these resources are ready to be harnessed for educational purposes, they may or may not be educational or may be suitable for some users only. Hence, it is crucial to annotate these resources to personalize these resources to different user needs. We propose to annotate learning resources with folksonomy-derived description metadata for personalization to context profiles of users. A semantic model for folksonomy was formulated to integrate controlled vocabularies in folksonomy. It not only reduces reliance on domain experts in annotating learning resources but also opens new avenues for more comprehensive resource description, compared to numerical ratings in resource recommendation algorithm. The working principle of the resource annotation and recommendation mechanism is demonstrated via a prototype system implemented in a social network environment. A pilot user study shows that learners are positive about the system in terms of aspects apart from accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {In this manuscript we present a method that leverages social media for the effortless learning of object detectors. We are motivated by the fact that the increased training cost of methods demanding manual annotation, limits their ability to easily scale in different types of objects and domains. At the same time, the rapidly growing social media applications have made available a tremendous volume of tagged images, which could serve as a solution for this problem. However, the nature of annotations (i.e. global level) and the noise existing in the associated information (due to lack of structure, ambiguity, redundancy, and emotional tagging), prevents them from being readily compatible (i.e. accurate region level annotations) with the existing methods for training object detectors. We present a novel approach to overcome this deficiency using the collective knowledge aggregated in social sites to automatically determine a set of image regions that can be associated with a certain object. We study theoretically and experimentally when the prevailing trends (in terms of appearance frequency) in visual and tag information space converge into the same object, and how this convergence is influenced by the number of utilized images and the accuracy of the visual analysis algorithms. Evaluation results show that although the models trained using leveraged social media are inferior to the ones trained manually, there are cases where the user contributed content can be successfully used to facilitate scalable and effortless learning of object detectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea reported in this paper is about including not only the social context of the user but also the one for the resource. In the social network that we consider, the user social context brings its interests, which are captured from a collaborative tagging system, while the resource social context is related to clusters of tags, obtained by classification method, and users' opinions according to their expertise level on the resource. The results of our experiment evaluation on real-world datasets (crawled from delicious folksonomy) demonstrate significant improvements over traditional retrieval approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

A recommender system compares user profiles to some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item that they have not yet considered. These characteristics may be considered as content-based approach, collaborative filtering demographic filtering and hybrid recommender systems. Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommender systems. These methods are based on collecting and analyzing the information of a particular user behavior, activity, preferences and will predict the user's interest according to the similarity of other users. In this paper we address the problem of scalability associated with CF and propose a CF framework that combines collaborative tagging with genre interestingness measure for a movie RS. Our experiments on each movie dataset with recent timestamp demonstrate that the proposed CFT -GIM gives more accurate predictions of user's ratings as compared to both CF and CFT.},

There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.},

A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive itemsets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and del.icio.us, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains. © 2011 IEEE.},

We propose a cross-language social media retrieval system (CLSMR) to help users retrieve foreign-language tagged media content. We construct a Chinese to Korean CLSMR system that translates Chinese queries into Korean, retrieves content, and then translates the Korean tags in the search results back into Chinese. Our system translates NEs using a dictionary of bilingual NE pairs from Wikipedia and a pattern-based software translator which learns regular NE patterns from the web. The top-10 precision of YouTube retrieved results for our system was 0.39875. The K-C NE tag translation accuracy for the top-10 YouTube results was 77.6%, which shows that our translation method is fairly effective for named entities. A questionnaire given to users showed that automatically translated tags were considered as informative as a human-written summary. With our proposed CLSMR system, Chinese users can retrieve online Korean media files and get a basic understanding of their content with no knowledge of the Korean language. © 2011 IEEE.},

Subsequently, the extensive tagging data attract many researchers to mine useful information from these. In this paper, we propose a novel user interests quantified approach based on user-generated tags.

With new technologies, such as blogs, twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, people may create and disseminate content as never before. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Additionally, many open-source initiatives have shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. We have been working in this domain for a few years now, mostly focusing on small disaster relief groups and field command. One of the command problems is lack of information about the location where the disaster occurred. We believe some of this information could be crowdsourced, changing current practices and enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for crowdsourcing and present an initial proposal for harnessing collective intelligence for the fire department. © 2010 IEEE.},

The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {These days VLSC (Very Large-Scale Conversation) is a particular type of online conversation, that is large scale, public, text-based, many-to-many and persistent. The nature of VLSC allows the accumulation of thousands of conversation in a fraction of time, and it often grows out of users' readable capacity. Therefore, extracting dominant public opinion on VLSC is usually impossible without causing an information overload. In this paper, Qtag is proposed to improve the VLSC environment by extracting public opinion easily, enhancing the value of conversation, and increasing the participants' willingness to engage. A simulation which mimics reality is built to create a VLSC environment, and two sets of questionnaire are conducted to compare users' experiences before and after Qtag trial. © 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, like a web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model.We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

The perception of the target user can be enhanced by aggregating and analyzing the tags associated to an object by other users who share at least one tag with the target user in common for that object and recommending tags to him. Most of the existing techniques recommend tags on the basis of their popularity among the users. The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes. To observe the performance of our approach, experiments are carried out on the data collected from del.icio.us, a social book marking site that allows the users to tag URLs and share them with other people. © 2009 IEEE.},

Online text repositories for news agencies, digital libraries and other organizations currently store giga- and tera-bytes of data. Large amounts of unstructured text poses a serious challenge for data mining and knowledge extraction. End user participation coupled with distributed computation can play a crucial role in meeting these challenges. In many applications involving classification of text documents, web users often participate in the tagging process. This collaborative tagging results in the formation of large scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems which can function, scale and self-organize in the presence of highly transient population of nodes and do not need a central server for co-ordination. In this paper, we describe TagLearner, a P2P classifier learning system for extracting patterns from text data where the end users can participate both in the task of labeling the data and building a distributed classifier on it. We present a novel distributed linear programming based classification algorithm which is asynchronous in nature. The paper also provides extensive empirical results on text data obtained from an online repository - the NSF Abstracts Data. © 2009 IEEE.},

However, automated knowledge delivering service among the systems is difficult to take into account the corresponding context (or semantics) of the knowledge, so that the service can spread irrelevant information into knowledge management systems. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a novel architecture, called blog context overlay network, to fulfill context matching between blog-based knowledge management systems. It is referred to as detecting 'shared' context between knowledge management systems. Thus, with respect to the contexts, we want to identify a community of practice (CoP) on a knowledge blogosphere where a set of blog-based knowledge management systems are incorporating with each other. As a result, newly generated knowledge can be proactively diffused to the blog-based knowledge management systems of which context is relevant to the knowledge, even before the bloggers' queries are explicitly asked. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system provides relevance searching, which is more effective than traditional keyword searching for searching personal resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

In our paper, we have proposed a collective collaborative tagging (CCT) service architecture in which both service providers and individual users can merge folksonomy data (in the form of keyword tags) stored in different sources to build a larger, unified repository. We have also examined a range of algorithms that can be applied to different problems in folksonomy analysis and information discovery. These algorithms address several common problems for online systems: searching, getting recommendations, finding communities of similar users, and finding interesting new information by trends. Our contributions are to a) systematically examine the available public algorithms' application to tag-based folksonomies, and b) to propose a service architecture that can provide these algorithms as online capabilities.},

Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keywordbased and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords. © 2008 IEEE.},

While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system. In this paper we describe our proposal and some results of our preliminary experiments. We also discuss the significance of the work and how it can be evaluated. © 2008 IEEE.},

We present TagScore, a scoring function to rate the goodness of Del.icio.us tags for their associated web page.

  abstract      = {As the number of Web 2.0 sites offering tagging facilities for the users' voluntary content annotation increases, so do the efforts to analyze social phenomena resulting from generated tagging and folksonomies. Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused. In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as Semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data. © 2008 IEEE.},

This paper presents an extension to the LOCO-Analyst tool, which leverages student folksonomies to support instructors when revising and updating course domain ontologies. The support is based on a computation of relatedness between ontology concepts and students tags which takes into account the "context" defined by the domain ontology. The computed scores are visualized in a tag cloud along with tag popularity scores, to allow instructors to easily comprehend the emergent feedback of their students. This approach allows for a simple and intuitive method for instructors to associate tags with concepts in their domain ontology. © 2008 IEEE.},

While there has been considerable interest in social bookmarking and collaborative tagging systems in recent years, very little is known about their actual usage. In this paper, we present the results of a field study of a social bookmarking service that has been deployed in a large enterprise. We present new quantitative data on how a corporate social bookmarking system was used, through in-depth analysis of the bookmark and tag data. We specifically explore the patterns of information sharing and social interaction for a twelve month period of time across three groups within a large enterprise. We discuss how the results of our investigation can used to better support communities of practice with social bookmarking services. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

Therefore users want more accurate materials because of expensive communication cost or the useless results due to abuse of tags.

There are a number of successful deployments of collaborative tagging systems that effectively recruits the activity of human users into collecting and annotating vast amounts of web resources. They lead to an emergent categorization of web resources in terms of tags, and create a different kind of web directory. However, the current ways of exploration in the tagging space are limited, which cannot get the most out of the real value of it.

In this paper, we exploit a popular type of metadata called collaborative tags to address this issue. Specifically, we identify basic level concepts and then construct ontologies from the collaborative tags. The generated ontologies can be employed to organize and index user-generated multimedia data. Existing research lacks a principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human perspective. In contrast, we borrow the idea of a family of concepts called basic level concepts from cognitive psychology. These basic level concepts are frequently used by people in their daily life and when organizing human knowledge. In this paper, we extract ontologies with basic level concepts from collaborative tags. Furthermore, we model the effect of context and present a method for context-aware basic level concepts detection for ontology learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on context-aware basic level concept detection in collaborative tagging for the construction of ontologies. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were conducted on real datasets using the Open Directory Project (ODP) as a benchmark. The experimental results illustrate that ontologies extracted by our approach are more rational and human-oriented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {In social tagging systems, like Mendeley, CiteULike, and BibSonomy, users can post, tag, visit, or export scholarly publications. In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage points. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {With the rapid development of Web 2.0 communities, there has been a tremendous increase in user-generated content. Confronting such a vast volume of resources in collaborative tagging systems, users require a novel method for fast exploring and indexing so as to find their desired data. To this end, contextual information is indispensable and critical in understanding user preferences and intentions. In sociolinguistics, context can be classified as verbal context and social context. Compared with verbal context, social context requires not only domain knowledge to build pre-defined contextual attributes but also additional user data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed the issue of irrelevant contextual factors for the verbal context model. To bridge this gap, the dominating set obtained from verbal context is proposed in this paper. We present (i) the verbal context graph to model contents and interrelationships of verbal context in folksonomy and thus capture the user intention; (ii) a method of discovering dominating set that provides a good balance of essentiality and integrality to de-emphasize irrelevant contextual factors and to keep the major characteristics of the verbal context graph; and (iii) a revised ranking method for measuring the relevance of a resource to an issued query, a discovered context and an extracted user profile. The experimental results obtained for a public dataset illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than existing baseline approaches. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract        = {Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract        = {With the increase in resource-sharing websites such as YouTube and Flickr, many shared resources have arisen on the Web. Personalized searches have become more important and challenging since users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized searches need to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provides a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized searches. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in collaborative tagging systems. We use a normalized term frequency to indicate the preference degree of a user on a tag. A novel search method using such profiles of users and resources is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource searches. In our framework, instead of the keyword matching or similarity measurement used in previous works, the relevance measurement between a resource and a user query (termed the query relevance) is treated as a fuzzy satisfaction problem of a user's query requirements. We implement a prototype system called the Folksonomy-based Multimedia Retrieval System (FMRS). Experiments using the FMRS data set and the MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {In the era of big data, collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems have proliferated as a consequence of the growth of Web 2.0 communities. Constructing user profiles from folksonomy systems is useful for many applications such as personalized search and recommender systems. The identification of latent user communities is one way to better understand and meet user needs. The behavior of users is highly influenced by the behavior of their neighbors or community members, and this can be utilized in constructing user profiles. However, conventional user profiling techniques often encounter data sparsity problems as data from a single user is insufficient to build a powerful profile. Hence, in this paper we propose a method of enriching user profiles based on latent user communities in folksonomy data. Specifically, the proposed approach contains four sub-processes: (i) tag-based user profiles are extracted from a folksonomy tripartite graph; (ii) a multi-faceted folksonomy graph is constructed by integrating tag and image affinity subgraphs with the folksonomy tripartite graph; (iii) random walk distance is used to unify various relationships and measure user similarities; (iv) a novel prototype-based clustering method based on user similarities is used to identify user communities, which are further used to enrich the extracted user profiles. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a public dataset, the results of which show that our approach outperforms previous ones in user profile enrichment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user's social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the "social friends" network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system's performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user's preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Even though they are good for certain search tasks, they may be less effective for others, such as satisfying ambiguous or synonym queries. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that, with the help of Wikipedia and collaborative semantic annotations, improves the quality of web search engines in the ranking of returned results. Our work is supported by (1) the logs generated after query searching, (2) semantic annotations of queries and (3) semantic annotations of web pages. The algorithm makes use of this information to elaborate an appropriate ranking. To validate our approach we have implemented a system that can apply the algorithm to a particular search engine. Evaluation results show that the number of relevant web resources obtained after executing a query with the algorithm is higher than the one obtained without it. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {While recommendation approaches exploiting different input sources have started to proliferate in the literature, an explicit study of the effect of the combination of heterogeneous inputs is still missing. On the other hand, in this context there are sides to recommendation quality requiring further characterisation and methodological research - a gap that is acknowledged in the field. We present a comparative study on the influence that different types of information available in social systems have on item recommendation. Aiming to identify which sources of user interest evidence - tags, social contacts, and user-item interaction data - are more effective to achieve useful recommendations, and in what aspect, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering, and social recommenders on three datasets obtained from Delicious, Last. fm, and MovieLens. Aiming to determine whether and how combining such information sources may enhance over individual recommendation approaches, we extend the common accuracy-oriented evaluation practice with various metrics to measure further recommendation quality dimensions, namely coverage, diversity, novelty, overlap, and relative diversity between ranked item recommendations. We report empiric observations showing that exploiting tagging information by content-based recommenders provides high coverage and novelty, and combining social networking and collaborative filtering information by hybrid recommenders results in high accuracy and diversity. This, along with the fact that recommendation lists from the evaluated approaches had low overlap and relative diversity values between them, gives insights that meta-hybrid recommenders combining the above strategies may provide valuable, balanced item suggestions in terms of performance and non-performance metrics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In sites such as Del.icio.us, Technorati or Flickr, users annotate a variety of resources, including Web pages, blogs, pictures, videos or bibliographic references; using freely chosen textual labels or tags. Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web. In this paper we present an empirical study carried out to determine the value of tags in resource classification. Furthermore, the use of several filtering and pre-processing operations to reduce the ambiguity and noise in tags are analyzed to determine whether they allow to increase the quality of resource classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O.n/.},

Analyzing the data, one can observe that the visitor loyalty, their lengthy visits to the site and the pages they view are much higher for the site built on the principles of Web 2.0, compared to the classical sites. Likewise, we developed and implemented a collaborative tagging system that allows every registered user to publish, save and label the content with the help of tags. Therefore, this can help in building a model that not only offers customized content but also adapts the site to user needs by providing a recommendation system and aggregate collective intelligence. © 2010 IEEE.},

Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system.

Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users' Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique (Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution), which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy (expressed in a FO) to support ontology review and enhancement.

  abstract        = {Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A folder is usually assumed to store the semantically related information in the form of files and sub-folders. However, there always exist related files somewhere else in the local file system hierarchy. Users often fail to find these disconnected files or discover the relationship among these. File systems maintain a plain set of metadata items about each file which could be utilized to discover some of the hidden relationships. However, this meta-information is very sparse as most of this metadata is rarely entered by the user. Moreover, files in a file system are mostly private and cannot get the benefit of collaborative tagging. Web of Data, on the other hand also contains information related to the file system objects which could be utilized for linking with information in file systems.

“Folksonomized Ontology and the 3E Steps Technique to Support Ontology Evolvement”
by Hugo Alves, Andre Santanche
in Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 18, August 2012, pp. 19-30Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions -from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Step- technique - Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution -, which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy - expressed in a FO - to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool.},

One important problem is how to find out experts who are qualified and willing to answer the question. Also, with the rapidly increasing number of new questions, experts of experienced in specified domains are not easy to find their interested questions. In this paper, we assume that the ones who have relationships with the questioner are more willing to answer the questions proposed by the questioner than other people. Based on this assumption, we explore the problem of Social Question and Answering and proposed a method to find out the experts who are qualified and willing to answer the questions based on the social relationships of the questioner.},

One of the challenging issues in this area is to successfully understand customers' affective needs and to interpret it in terms of product design elements. Previous studies have attempted to obtain customer's affective needs using manual approaches, e.g. survey, which is time-consuming and a costly process. In relation, the study for such a need is usually limited to a number of product features only. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative tagging approach for discovering product features, affective description and their associations from product review analysis. Specifically, we have discussed on the tagging task assignment, tags aggregation and performance analysis of our proposal. A case study on discovering feature-affective associations from car reviews is reported to showcase the feasibility of our approach.},

The similarity of objects on the web (e.g., webpages, photos, music, micro-blogs, and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects in many recent applications. SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes.},

Although tags may not be per se sensitive information, the wide use of collaborative tagging services increases the risk of cross referencing, thereby seriously compromising user privacy. In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users.},
