  abstract  = {Mashups are prevalent Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) based applications consisting of multiple Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and content. Tags have been extensively used to organize and index mashup services. However, people favor manual tags creation in the past. This approach demands user intervention, which is extremely time-consuming and probes to errors. In this paper we propose a novel Mashup-API-Tag model for automatic mashup tag recommendation. The model simultaneously incorporates the composition relationships between mashups and APIs as well as the annotation relationships between APIs and tags to discover the latent topics. Then the semantic similarity between Web APIs and mashups can be acquired. Subsequently, tags of chosen APIs are recommended to a mashup where the mashup and the APIs are most similar. In addition, we develop a tag filtering algorithm to select the most relevant tags for recommendation. The experimental results on a real world dataset prove that our approach outperforms other methods, including frequency-based methods and the methods that only consider the composition relationships and the annotation relationships separately.},

  abstract = {Given a collection of web images with the corresponding textual descriptions, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain learning method to classify these web multimedia objects by transferring the correlation knowledge among different information sources. Here, the knowledge is extracted from unlabeled objects through unsupervised learning and applied to perform supervised classification tasks. To mine more meaningful correlation knowledge, instead of using commonly used visual words in the traditional bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, we discover higher level visual components (words and phrases) to incorporate the spatial and semantic information into our image representation model, i.e., bag-of-visual-phrases (BoP). By combining the enriched visual components with the textual words, we calculate the frequently co-occurring pairs among them to construct a cross-domain correlated graph in which the correlation knowledge is mined. After that, we investigate two different strategies to apply such knowledge to enrich the feature space where the supervised classification is performed. By transferring such knowledge, our cross-domain transfer learning method can not only handle large scale web multimedia objects, but also deal with the situation that the textual descriptions of a small portion of web images are missing. Empirical experiments on two different datasets of web multimedia objects are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain transfer learning method.},

Searching a hash tag simply shows a list of tweets, each contains the query hash tag string. To find even more relevant hash tags, we propose to use a graph-based approach to find similar hash tags by using the social network graph around hash tags. We start by using a heterogeneous social graph that contains users, tweets, and hash tags, then we summarize the graph to a hash tag graph that shows the similarity between different hash tags. Finally, we rank the vertices in respect to a query hash tag using a random walk with restart and a content similarity measure. The experimental work demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to baselines.},

It naturally incorporates the rich set of features for social activities, models the networking effect by label propagation, and learns the feature weights so that the labels are propagated to the right users. To validate its effectiveness, we show our case studies on identifying the employees of "China Telecom" and "China Unicom" from Sina Weibo.

At the core of semantic extraction is the identification of concepts and relationships that are present in the data. We show, through an experimental study on tagged photographs, how to extract concepts associated with photographs and their relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to extract a concept associated with a photograph with an overall precision score of 80%. Our experiments also show that a variation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient on sets of tags can be used to determine equivalence relationships between the concepts associated with these sets.},

  abstract  = {The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

However, these tags are often imprecise and incomplete, which essentially limits tag-based image indexing and related applications. To tackle this issue, we propose an image retagging scheme that aims at refining the quality of the tags. The retagging process is formulated as a multiple graph-based multi-label learning problem, which simultaneously explores the visual content of the images, semantic correlation of the tags as well as the prior information provided by users. Different from classical single graph-based multi-label learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm propagates the information of each tag along an individual tag-specific similarity graph, which reflects the particular relationship among the images with respect to the specific tag and at the same time the propagations of different tags interact with each other in a collaborative way with an extra tag similarity graph. In particular, we present a robust tag-specific visual sub-vocabulary learning algorithm for the construction of those tag-specific graphs. Experimental results on two benchmark Flickr image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image retagging scheme. We also show the remarkable performance improvements brought by retagging in the task of image ranking.},

When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.},

First, a semantic computing technique devised for mood-related tags in large datasets is applied to Last.fm and I Like Music (ILM) corpora separately (250,000 tracks each). The resulting semantic estimates are then correlated with listener ratings of arousal, valence and tension. High correlations (Spearman's rho) are found between the track positions in the dimensional mood spaces and listener ratings using both data sources (0.60 <; rs <; 0.70).

Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.},

Adopting techniques from text categorization, we downloaded Web pages and their associated tags from del.icio.us, and trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to determine if the documents could be assigned to their associated tags. Results from the classifiers in terms of precision, recall and F1 score were mixed, suggesting that that not all tags could be used by public users for resource discovery.

Fas Tag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of Fas Tag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, Fas Tag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags. The experiments we did on several datasets show a significant improvement of the accuracy of the recommendations.},

  abstract = {Social tags serve as a textual source of simple but useful semantic metadata that reflect user preferences or describe web objects and have been widely used in many applications. However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e. non-IIDness), which means that existing text analysis methods such as LDA are not directly applicable. In this article, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation that models tag generation based on both users and objects and, thus, accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as a user-topic distribution matrix and an object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets showed that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely-used point-wise mutual information (PMI) metric. In addition, we analyze the learned topics and show that our model recovers more themes from social tags, while LDA may lead to vanishing topic problems. We also demonstrate our model's advantages in social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristics of the social tagging process.},

The naive approach to perform filtering early at the publisher edge works only if complete knowledge of the subscriptions is available, which is not compatible with the well-established covering optimization in scalable content-based publish/subscribe systems. We propose an efficient rank-cover technique to reconcile top-k subscription filtering with covering. We extend the covering model to support top-k and describe a novel algorithm for forwarding subscriptions to publishers while maintaining correctness. Finally, we compare our solutions to a baseline covering system. In a typical setting, our optimized solution is scalable and provides over 81% of the covering benefit.},

The main contributions of our work are that: (1) to efficiently make use of tags, social image tags are re-ranked according to the image content; (2) to obtain user preference, a User-Image-Tag model is constructed with tripartite graph according to the correlation among users, images and Topranking tags; (3) a personalized social recommendation system is implemented based on User-Image-Tag model.

Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) method and the kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy).

Different from existing solutions which employ user profile or social network structure alone, in this paper, we proposed a novel joint solution named MapMe, which takes both user profile and social network structure feature into account, so that it can adapt more OSNs with more accurate results. MapMe first calculates user similarity via profile features with the Doc2vec method. Then, it evaluates user similarity by analyzing user’s ego network features. Finally, the profile features and ego network features were combined to measure the similarity of the users. Consequently, MapMe balances the two similarity factors to achieve goals in different platforms and scenarios. Finally, experiments are conducted on the synthetic and real data sets, proving that MapMe outperforms the existing methods with 10% on average.},

In this paper, our motive is to develop a recommender system that is based on user assigned tags and content present on web pages. Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation.},

EBSNs capture not only the online social relationship, but also the offline interactions from offline events. They contain rich heterogeneous information, including multiple types of entities, such as users, events, groups and tags, and their interaction relations. Three recommendation tasks, namely recommending groups to users, recommending tags to groups, and recommending events to users, have been explored in three separate studies. However, none of the proposed methods can handle all the three recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a general graph-based model, called HeteRS, to solve the three recommendation problems on EBSNs in one framework. Our method models the rich information with a heterogeneous graph and considers the recommendation problem as a query-dependent node proximity problem. To address the challenging issue of weighting the influences between different types of entities, we propose a learning scheme to set the influence weights between different types of entities. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all the three recommendation tasks, and the learned influence weights help understanding user behaviors.},

  abstract  = {Web 2.0 tools and environments have made tagging, the act of assigning keywords to on-line objects, a popular way to annotate shared resources. The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

  abstract  = {Tagging refers to the metadata that many users added in the form of keywords on photos, videos, and other resources for sharing the contents via the internet. However, there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve users' or groups of users' satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users' behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve users' experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a user's needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection.},

On the other hand, the explosive expansion of social web makes an overwhelming number of web videos available, among which there exists a large number of near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective. A novel classifier-free video annotation framework is proposed by first retrieving visual duplicates and then suggesting representative tags. The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task multi-feature metric learning method which models the information sharing mechanism among different learning tasks. We decompose the real world multi-class problems such as semantic categorization or automatic tagging into a set of tasks where each task corresponds to several classes with strong visual correlation. We conduct metric learning to learn a set of (hyper)category-specific metrics for all the tasks. By encouraging model sharing among tasks, more generalization power is acquired. Another advantage is the capability of simultaneous learning with semantic information and social tagging based on the multi-task learning framework, and thus they both benefit from the information provided by each other. Experiments demonstrate the advantages on applications including semantic categorization and automatic tagging compared with other popular metric learning approaches.},

Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques augments the capabilities of the platform without additional costs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition in MCS deployed over a fog computing platform which facilitates important operations like user recruitment and task completion. Proper data acquisition minimizes the monetary expenditure the platform sustains to recruit and compensate users and the energy they spend to sense and deliver data. We propose a new user recruitment policy called DSE (Distance, Sociability, Energy). The policy exploits three criteria: i) spatial distance between users and tasks, ii) user sociability, which is an estimate of the willingness of users to contribute to sensing tasks, and iii) remaining battery charge the devices. Performance evaluation is conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants with new metrics that assess the efficiency of the recruitment policy and the accuracy of task completion. Results reveal that the average number of recruited users improves by nearly 20% if compared to policies using only spatial distance as selection criterion.},

However, many real-world domains are currently left out of the social tagging phenomenon due to the lack of a wide-scale tagging-savvy audience - domains like the personal desktop, enterprise intranets, and digital libraries. Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement.},

The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

Three social factors, the influence and the activity of the target user, together with the coherence between users, are fused to improve the performance of proposed recommendation strategy. Experimental results show that, compared to the well-known PageRank-based algorithm, the proposed strategy performs much better in terms of precision and recall and it can effectively avoid a biased result caused by celebrity effect and zombie fans effect.},

  abstract  = {In Twitter, users can annotate tweets with hashtags to indicate the ongoing topics. Hashtags provide users a convenient way to categorize tweets. From the system's perspective, hashtags play an important role in tweet retrieval, event detection, topic tracking, and advertising, etc. Annotating tweets with the right hashtags can lead to a better user experience. However, two problems remain unsolved during an annotation: (1) Before the user decides to create a new hashtag, is there any way to help her/him find out whether some related hashtags have already been created and widely used? (2) Different users may have different preferences for categorizing tweets. However, few work has been done to study the personalization issue in hashtag recommendation. To address the above problems, we propose a statistical model for personalized hashtag recommendation in this paper. With millions of <;tweet, hashtag> pairs being published everyday, we are able to learn the complex mappings from tweets to hashtags with the wisdom of the crowd. Two questions are answered in the model: (1) Different from traditional item recommendation data, users and tweets in Twitter have rich auxiliary information like URLs, mentions, locations, social relations, etc. How can we incorporate these features for hashtag recommendation? (2) Different hashtags have different temporal characteristics. Hashtags related to breaking events in the physical world have strong rise-and-fall temporal pattern while some other hashtags remain stable in the system. How can we incorporate hashtag related features to serve for hashtag recommendation? With all the above factors considered, we show that our model successfully outperforms existing methods on real datasets crawled from Twitter.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

We show in this paper how a Hasse diagram is an efficient visualization strategy for eliciting different groups and navigating through them. However, we do not limit this strategy to these traditional uses. Instead we show how it can also be used for assisting in indexing new photos. Indexing consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a novel way of building the Hasse diagram. To validate the approach, we present some tests conducted with a sample of users that confirm the interest of this organization, visualization and indexation approach. Finally, we conclude by considering scalability, the possibility to extract social networks and automatically create personalised albums.},

We propose a clustering method called “Tripartite Clustering” which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering.

  abstract = {Social tagging becomes increasingly important to organize and search large-scale community-contributed photos on social websites. To facilitate generating high-quality social tags, tag recommendation by automatically assigning relevant tags to photos draws particular research interest. In this paper, we focus on the personalized tag recommendation task and try to identify user-preferred, geo-location-specific as well as semantically relevant tags for a photo by leveraging rich contexts of the freely available community-contributed photos. For users and geo-locations, we assume they have different preferred tags assigned to a photo, and propose a subspace learning method to individually uncover the both types of preferences. The goal of our work is to learn a unified subspace shared by the visual and textual domains to make visual features and textual information of photos comparable. Considering the visual feature is a lower level representation on semantics than the textual information, we adopt a progressive learning strategy by additionally introducing an intermediate subspace for the visual domain, and expect it to have consistent local structure with the textual space. Accordingly, the unified subspace is mapped from the intermediate subspace and the textual space respectively. We formulate the above learning problems into a united form, and present an iterative optimization with its convergence proof. Given an untagged photo with its geo-location to a user, the user-preferred and the geo-location-specific tags are found by the nearest neighbor search in the corresponding unified spaces. Then we combine the obtained tags and the visual appearance of the photo to discover the semantically and visually related photos, among which the most frequent tags are used as the recommended tags. Experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Flickr verify the effectivity of the proposed solution.},

  abstract  = {Social tagging is an innovative and powerful mechanism introduced with Web 2.0: it shifts the task of classifying resources from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

  abstract  = {Recently, the boom of media contents on the Internet raises challenges in managing them effectively and thus requires automatic media annotation techniques. Motivated by the observation that media contents are usually shared frequently in online communities and thus have a lot of social diffusion records, we propose a novel media annotating approach depending on these social diffusion records instead of metadata. The basic assumption is that the social diffusion records reflect the common interests (CI) between users, which can be analyzed for generating annotations. With this assumption, we present a novel CI-based social diffusion model and translate the automatic annotating task into the CI-based diffusion maximization (CIDM) problem. Moreover, we propose to solve the CIDM problem through two optimization tasks, corresponding to the training and test stages in supervised learning. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach can effectively generate high quality annotations, and thus demonstrate the capability of social diffusion analysis in annotating media.},

In such systems, Users are allowed to annotate a particular resource with a freely chosen a set of tags. These user-generated tags can represent users' interests more concise and closer to human understanding. Interests will change over time. Thus, how to describe users' interests and interests transfer path become a big challenge for personalized recommendation systems. In this approach, we propose a variable-length time interval division algorithm and user interest model based on time interval. Then, in order to draw users' interests transfer path over a specific time period, we suggest interest transfer model. After that, we apply a classical community partition algorithm in our approach to separate users into communities. Finally, we raise a novel method to measure users' similarities based on interest transfer model and provide personalized tag recommendation according to similar users' interests in their next time intervals. Experimental results demonstrate the higher precision and recall with our approach than classical user-based collaborative filtering methods.},

  abstract  = {With the permission of annotating blog posts with tags, tags has become one of the most important resources used to describe blogger features. However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

This formulation allows for decoupling the representation size from the number of used codewords, as well as for better modeling the feature distribution using a separate trainable scaling parameter for each RBF neuron. The resulting network, called retrieval-oriented neural BoF (RN-BoF), is trained using regular back propagation and allows for fast extraction of compact image representations. It is demonstrated that the RN-BoF model is capable of: 1) increasing the object encoding and retrieval speed; 2) reducing the extracted representation size; and 3) increasing the retrieval precision. A symmetry-aware spatial segmentation technique is also proposed to further reduce the encoding time and the storage requirements and allows the method to efficiently scale to large datasets. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques using five different image datasets, including the large-scale YouTube Faces database.},

Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

Great progress has been made especially in recent couple of years with the development of deep learning models for image content analysis and extraction of content-based concept labels. However, concept objects labels are much more friendly to machine than to users. We consider that more relevant and user-friendly visual labels need to include “context” descriptors. In this study we explore the possibilities to leverage social media content as a resource for visual labeling. We developed a tag extraction system that applies heuristic rules and term weighting method to extract image tags from associated Tweet. The system retrieves tweet-image pairs from public Twitter accounts, analyzes the Tweet, and generates labels for the images. We elaborate on different visual labeling methods, tag analysis and tag refinement methods.},

We introduce the possibility of (i) labeling linking tags to construct a network of tags and (ii) defining the concrete meaning of a tag by choosing the right definition extracted from Wikimedia projects or by writing down a particular definition. This provides the context for disambiguating the semantic of tags and it can be used to refine searches and/or suggestions. Moreover, this leads to alleviate some of the problems regarding the use of a natural vocabulary in a faceted classification. We provide some definitions and show examples of the so-called second generation of tag-clouds. We conclude with some implications that make use of the layout algorithm for visualizing a set of more than 400 tags.},

  abstract  = {With the exponentially growing volume of digital documents and internet content, it becomes very challenging to locate right information when desired. We heavily rely on search engines but most existing search tools are key-word based and they often return search results with low precision and recall. The emerging semantic tagging technology provides an automatic way to generate semantic tags from text. It has drawn more and more interest from text mining research communities. It is critical to study how to utilize semantic tags to improve text mining including clustering, which helps users to enhance their experience of searching and browsing documents. Unfortunately, most previous works on text clustering merely based on content information. A few recent researches take user-generated tags into account, however user generated tags are often noisy, inconsistent, redundant and lack of semantic information and hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a Semantic Text Mining (STeM) framework to generate semantic tags for given documents and then utilize the semantic tags to improve text clustering. Different from the previous works, we represent a document by a combination of domains and high quality noun phrases. We investigate the performance of our methods in two different datasets and the results are evaluated by normalized mutual information. Experiment results demonstrated that our proposed method substantially outperformed the traditional Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) term vector based clustering. We find that incorporating semantic information into document representation is critical to improve the performance of text clustering.},

Integrating the medical knowledge bases has the potential to improve the information retrieval performance through incorporating medical domain knowledge for relevance assessment. However, this is not a trivial task due to the challenges to effectively utilize the domain knowledge in the medical knowledge bases. In this paper, we proposed a novel medical information retrieval system with a two-stage query expansion strategy, which is able to effectively model and incorporate the latent semantic associations to improve the performance. This system consists of two parts. First, we applied a heuristic approach to enhance the widely used pseudo relevance feedback method for more effective query expansion, through iteratively expanding the queries to boost the similarity score between queries and documents. Second, to improve the retrieval performance with structured knowledge bases, we presented a latent semantic relevance model based on tensor factorization to identify semantic association patterns under sparse settings. These identified patterns are then used as inference paths to trigger knowledge-based query expansion in medical information retrieval. Experiments with the TREC CDS 2014 data set: 1) showed that the performance of the proposed system is significantly better than the baseline system and the systems reported in TREC CDS 2014 conference, and is comparable with the state-of-the-art systems and 2) demonstrated the capability of tensor-based semantic enrichment methods for medical information retrieval tasks.},

Since social tags are usually as signed by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation is another useful information for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem. The results of audio tag annotation and retrieval experiments demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics.

However, a significant amount of travel images on the Internet lack proper geographical annotations or tags. In many cases, the images are tagged manually. One way to make this time-consuming manual tagging process more efficient is to propagate tags from a small set of tagged images to the larger set of untagged images automatically. In this paper, we present a system for automatic geotag propagation in images based on the similarity between image content (famous landmarks) and its context (associated geotags). In such a scenario, however, an incorrect or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated propagation system. Therefore, for reliable geotags propagation, we suggest adopting a user trust model based on social feedback from the users of the photo-sharing system. We compare this socially-driven approach with other user trust models via experiments and subjective testing on an image database of various famous landmarks. Results demonstrate that relying on user feedback is more efficient, since the number of propagated tags more than doubles without loss of accuracy compared to using other models or propagating without trust modeling.},

Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

  abstract  = {Automatic annotation of images is of crucial importance in image retrieval and management systems. Most of the existing annotation methods rely on content-based approach to annotation, whose effectiveness is restricted due to the semantic gap between low-level features and semantic annotations, as well as the irrelevance between annotations and image content. Recently, social media analysis has been investigated for image annotation. Inspired by the abundant social diffusion records of images in online social networks, we propose a novel image annotation approach based on social diffusion analysis. We present a common-interest model to interpret social diffusion, i.e. different images have different social diffusion routes due to the preferences of users, and such preferences are represented as common interests of pairwise users rather than personalized interests. We propose an image annotation framework that consists of learning of common interests, feature extraction from social diffusion records, and automatic annotation by learning to rank. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms content-based and user-preference-based annotation methods.},

We conduct the first study that surveys the literature related to social authentication. In this paper, we not only created a taxonomy for classifying all social authentication schemes deployed in online or physical social contexts and extensively analyzed their authentication features, but also built a novel framework for evaluating the effectiveness of all social authentication schemes, identified all the practical and theoretical attacks that may be mounted against such schemes, addressed possible defense strategies, and identified challenges, open questions, and future research opportunities. To measure their accuracy, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations, as well as to identify the potential of knowledge-based and trust-based social authentication schemes, a comprehensive comparative assessment of the security, usability, and deployability was conducted. We hope, by providing a solid foundation for gaining sufficient understanding of the manners in which users' social interactions have been utilized in user authentication schemes and their corresponding security implications, we will guide future research in this domain.},

Meta-data, accompanying the raw data, can assist data manipulation and processing, e.g. the tags assigned to social images. Many systems for automatic image tagging are based on pair-wise relations. Recent approaches focus on relations among multiple vertices (i.e. items), which are respresented as hyperedges in a hypergraph. In this work, an image tagging methodology is proposed that exploits a factorization of a tensor, capturing high-order relations among multiple Flickr images. The proposed approach uses an extended graph, where the vertices represent images as well as users. By analysing the data communities and their similarities, image annotation is proposed.},

The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application. However, existing surveys are either outdated or they focus only on a few methods. As a result, there is an increasing need to summarize the obtained knowledge in a concise, yet informative manner. Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as this task poses significant challenges due to varying conditions during data acquisition. In addition, face verification is a natural application for distance metric learning because the encountered challenge is to define a distance function that: 1) accurately expresses the notion of similarity for verification; 2) is robust to noisy data; 3) generalizes well to unseen subjects; and 4) scales well with the dimensionality and number of training samples. In particular, we utilize well-tested features to assess the performance of selected methods following the experimental protocol of the state-of-the-art database labeled faces in the wild. A summary of the results is presented along with a discussion of the insights obtained and lessons learned by employing the corresponding algorithms.},

Discovering the correlations among different tags can significantly help predicting precise labels for videos and images. Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty. By casting the video concept detection and image annotation tasks into a sparse multi-label transfer learning framework in this paper, ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, and the multi-label extended sparse discriminant analysis methods are, respectively, well explored and compared.},

  abstract  = {Tag recommendation is an integral part of any bookmarking application. With the growing popularity in Web 2.0 usage, recommending tags is of utmost importance in enabling a user to perform bookmarking easily. An issue that most recommendation systems do not consider is that users have a tendency to choose from tags that are suggested to them, which might bias the true popular rankings of tags. In this paper we consider the problem of tag recommendation for bookmarks based on user feedback. We propose an approach for automatic tag recommendation by using a suggestion set and discuss a randomized suggestion rule for learning the true popular tags. As our algorithm depends on the frequency of tag suggestions, the action of spammers and malicious users may result in skewed ranking of tags for a bookmark. Hence, there arises a need to identify malicious users and spam posts to reinforce the efficiency of our algorithm because spammers can easily mislead a system. We have proposed an approach for classifying spammers based on tagging history of users. Our approach basically estimates the probability of a user being a spammer by analyzing previous posts and tags. Our analysis on a dataset of a popular bookmarking site shows that the proposed method is effective in suggesting the true popular tags and identifying spammers.},

One way to address this challenge is to consider these data streams as containing a set of high-level topics. In this research we address the problem of: given a collection of tweets about K high-level topics, how to find topic words that describe these topics as well as how to label each tweet with one of the K topics using a topic modeling approach. Current research has shown that applying topic modeling algorithms directly on tweets does not lead to good results. Hence one approach is to group related tweets together, so as to form a single “pseudo-document”, which is more informative than a single tweet. In this paper we evaluate different grouping schemes found in the literature and propose a new grouping scheme utilizing named entities and word collocations. Results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the existing approaches, to a some extent for all the test cases, and for both finding high-level topics and tweet labeling.},

Classifiers are trained to map audio features to these labels. However, the performances of these classifiers on individual labels are rarely satisfactory. In the case we have to predict several labels simultaneously, we introduce a correction scheme to improve these performances. In this scheme-an instance of the classifier fusion paradigm-an extra layer of classifiers is built to exploit redundancies between labels and correct some of the errors coming from the individual acoustic classifiers. We describe a series of experiments aiming at validating this approach on a large-scale database of music and metadata (about 30 000 titles and 600 labels per title). The experiments show that the approach brings statistically significant improvements.},

This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of social image understanding, i.e., tag refinement, tag assignment, and image retrieval. Different from previous work, we propose a novel weakly supervised deep matrix factorization algorithm, which uncovers the latent image representations and tag representations embedded in the latent subspace by collaboratively exploring the weakly supervised tagging information, the visual structure, and the semantic structure. Due to the well-known semantic gap, the hidden representations of images are learned by a hierarchical model, which are progressively transformed from the visual feature space. It can naturally embed new images into the subspace using the learned deep architecture. The semantic and visual structures are jointly incorporated to learn a semantic subspace without overfitting the noisy, incomplete, or subjective tags. Besides, to remove the noisy or redundant visual features, a sparse model is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep architecture. Finally, a unified optimization problem with a well-defined objective function is developed to formulate the proposed problem and solved by a gradient descent procedure with curvilinear search. Extensive experiments on real-world social image databases are conducted on the tasks of image understanding: image tag refinement, assignment, and retrieval. Encouraging results are achieved with comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Performing user identity mapping on multi-platform based on the behavior patterns of users is considerable for network supervision and personalization service. The existing methods focus on utilizing either text information or structure information alone. However, text information and structure information reflect different aspects of a user. An organic combination of them is beneficial to mining user behavior patterns, thus help identify users across platforms accurately. The challenging problems are the effective representation and similarity computation of the text and structure information. We propose a mapping method which integrates text and structure information. At first, the model represents user name, description, location information based on word2vec or string matching, and friend information represented as relation network is regarded as structure information. Then these information are used for similarity computation using Jaccard index or cosine similarity. After similarity computation, a linear model is adopted to get the overall similarity of user pairs to perform user mapping. Based on the proposed method, we develop a prototype system, which allows users to set and adjust the weights of different information, or set expected index. The experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model.},

In the submission to ISMIR'07, Mohamed Sordo proposed a novel model, i.e., propagation of labels, to annotate music with existing labels, by using the content-based music similarity distance. In that model, a partially annotated collection with a lot of non-labeled music was annotated at a high precision and recall. In this paper, we proposed a new model -- label probability prediction model -- and introduce it into the Sordo's work, which makes a combined model, to improve the accuracy of propagation without exploiting any other information. In addition, we also made some modifications to the original Sordo's model that could make the algorithm works better. Then we compare the result of combined model to that yielded by the original on a publicly accessible ground truth data, and find that, the new approach can reach a higher recall.

The proposed approach begins with the reduced set of a dataset, which is a condensation of the dataset obtained by the well-developed kernel density estimators reduced set density estimator or fast reduced set density estimator, and then enters into its two advantageous stages: 1) fast exemplar finding (FEF) and 2) fast cluster assignment. The idea of the proposed approach has its basis in three assumptions: 1) exemplars should come from high-density samples; 2) exemplars should be either the components of the reduced set or their neighbors with high similarities; and 3) clusters can be diffused by surrounding both exemplars and its labeled reduced set. We theoretically analyze the proposed FEF from the perspective of the generalization performance of clustering and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on several benchmarking datasets.},

However, these tags are often not related to the actual image content, affecting the performance of tag related applications. In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the image tags is proposed. Firstly, information entropy of the tag is defined to refine tag frequency to predict tag initial relevance. Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {A novel method to obtain hierarchical and overlapping clusters from network data – i.e., a set of nodes endowed with pairwise dissimilarities – is presented. The introduced method is hierarchical in the sense that it outputs a nested collection of groupings of the node set depending on the resolution or degree of similarity desired, and it is overlapping since it allows nodes to belong to more than one group. Our construction is rooted on the facts that a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering of a network can be equivalently represented by a finite ultrametric space and that a convex combination of ultrametrics results in a cut metric. By applying a hierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering method to multiple dithered versions of a given network and then convexly combining the resulting ultrametrics, we obtain a cut metric associated to the network of interest. We then show how to extract a hierarchical overlapping clustering structure from the aforementioned cut metric. Furthermore, the so-called overlapping function is presented as a tool for gaining insights about the data by identifying meaningful resolutions of the obtained hierarchical structure. Additionally, we explore hierarchical overlapping quasi-clustering methods that preserve the asymmetry of the data contained in directed networks. Finally, the presented method is illustrated via synthetic and real-world classification problems including handwritten digit classification and authorship attribution of famous plays.},

Recently, it has been shown that if each data class is linearly spanned by a subspace of unknown dimensions and the data are noiseless, the lowest-rank representation (LRR) of a set of test vector samples with respect to a set of training vector samples has the nature of being both dense for within-class affinities and almost zero for between-class affinities. Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the LRRC among the classifiers that is compared to.},

Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

  abstract  = {Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common items which are tagged either manually or in a semiautomatic manner. However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).},

  abstract = {An image in social media, termed a social image, exhibits characteristics different from images widely discussed in image processing. They can be described by both content and social related attributes, called social image attributes, including visual contents, users, tags, and timestamps. There are strong coupling relationships between social image attributes, which make social images not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). By analyzing the relationships among these attributes, we can better understand the semantic activities conducted on such non-IID social images, hence enabling new applications including content organization, recommendation, and social activity understanding. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to analyze the coupling relationships between social images, which involves not only intra-coupled similarity within a social image attribute, but also inter-coupled similarity between attributes, in analyzing the non-IIDness of the similarity between social images. In particular, we propose a multi-entry version of the coupled similarity metric to deal with attributes (i.e., tags) which have a many-to-one relationship with respect to images. Experimental results on a Flickr group dataset show that the proposed algorithm captures coupling relationships and therefore achieves promising results in various applications, including image clustering and tagging.},

It was designed to simplify the tasks of information management for the organizations' staff. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation model and algorithm which are based on a faceted classification by level in the aim to facilitate the documents' indexing. This approach exploits the user trace indexing of his/her documents to learn about the user preferences and then to produce their recommendations. Consequently, these recommendations will provide a kind of knowledge base aiming at improving document ranking and highlight most relevant information that meeting user needs. This model is based on a statistical method called Association Rules (AR) using an Apriori algorithm to generate the recommendations.},

  abstract  = {The concept of Web 2.0 or "semantic web" has been getting more and more popular during the last half decade. The potential of very subtle yet important emergent semantics hidden in such environments calls for equally elegant and powerful methods to "mine" them. However, much of the previous work on model based recommender systems for folksonomies considered user to resource and resource to tag similarity separately, ignoring the dependency of users' interest to both the tags and the corresponding resources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic personalized recommendation model, Latent Interest Model, that accounts for users, tags and resources jointly. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on real data sets obtained from a popular online bookmarking site using different performance measures for tag and resource recommendation tasks. Our experimental results show that our model captures personal preferences for tag usage and resource selection. Performance evaluation of Latent Interest Model indicates that the proposed personalized method yields significant improvement of recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract = {Audio tags correspond to keywords that people use to describe different aspects of a music clip. With the explosive growth of digital music available on the Web, automatic audio tagging, which can be used to annotate unknown music or retrieve desirable music, is becoming increasingly important. This can be achieved by training a binary classifier for each tag based on the labeled music data. Our method that won the MIREX 2009 audio tagging competition is one of this kind of methods. However, since social tags are usually assigned by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation information is useful for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem and propose two solutions to solve it. The experimental results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a “query and ranking” manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, software engineers use a variety of online media to search and become informed of new and interesting technologies, and to learn from and help one another. We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively. Moreover, averaging over StackOverflow and Freecode results, we improve TagRec proposed by Al-Kofahi et al. by 22.65% and 14.95%, and the tag recommendation method proposed by Zangerle et al. by 18.5% and 7.35% for recall@5 and recall@10 scores.},

On the social media, images usually have an incomplete or noisy set of social tags provided by the mobile users, and we consider this issue as defective tag assignments. Previous studies on social image tagging have mostly focused on multi-label classification without considering the defective tags. In these studies, the usage of multi-label classification techniques is expected to synergically exploit the linear relations between the image features and the semantic tags. However, these approaches usually aimed to capture the linear relations from the training data while ignoring the helpful information from the test data. In addition, they failed to incorporate the non-linear associations residing in the visual features as well as in the semantic tags. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel approach based on non-linear matrix completion for image tagging task with defective tags. Specifically, we first construct the entire feature-tag matrix based on the visual features with non-linear kernel mapping. Then, we present a formal methodology together with an optimization method under the matrix completion framework to jointly complete the tags of training and test images. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method shows promising results on image tagging task on two benchmark social image datasets with defective tags, and establishes a baseline for such models in this research domain.},

Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes.

The features in frame-based feature vector sequence format are further represented by their mean and standard deviation such that they can be combined with other segment-based features to form a fixed-dimensional feature vector for a segment. We train an ensemble classifier, which consists of SVM and AdaBoost classifiers, for each tag. For the audio annotation task, the individual classifier outputs are transformed into calibrated probability scores such that probability ensemble can be employed. For the audio retrieval task, we propose using ranking ensemble.

Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

Further, in order to predict tags from queries and web documents, a tag prediction algorithm named as CTAG is proposed, which could concern tags from different levels, and performs much better than the baseline method like AutoTag.},

The second classifier maps actively corrupted tags to the true tags, reducing incorrect mappings caused by low-level acoustic variations in the first classifier, and to augment the tags with additional relevant tags. Training the classifiers is implemented using marginal co-regularization, pair of which draws the two classifiers into agreement by a joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on two sound datasets, Freefield1010 and Task4 of DCASE2016.

We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played. To evaluate the real-time tagging function, we simulate tag prediction on short music chunks. The results of experiments on the MajorMiner dataset demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed music tagging method.},

  abstract  = {Recommending text tags for on-line photos is useful for Internet photo services. Typical solutions to this problem require analysis of the correlation among different attributes of the photos, including the correlation between the textual features and visual features computed from a photo. However, most on-line photos have very few tags or even no tags, and thus they contribute little or none to the analysis of tag-photo correlation, which is a key component in those schemes that rely on such analysis for tag recommendation. To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a dataset of more than 33,000 photos collected from Flickr.},

  abstract = {While a listener may derive semantic associations for audio clips from direct auditory cues (e.g., hearing “bass guitar”) as well as from “context” (e.g., inferring “bass guitar” in the context of a “rock” song), most state-of-the-art systems for automatic music annotation ignore this context. Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the number of digital images has increased so that the management of this volume of data needs an efficient system for browsing, categorising and searching. Automatic image annotation is designed for assigning tags to images for more accurate retrieval. Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image annotation applications.},

For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

  abstract = {Due to the unprecedented growth of unedited videos, finding highlights relevant to a text query in a set of unedited videos has become increasingly important. We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) “viralets”, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including users’ comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.). 1

Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.

Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

  abstract  = {In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

  abstract  = {A novel multi-label annotation method is proposed and applied to music tagging. Each music recording is represented by its auditory temporal modulations (ATMs). Given a set of training music recordings represented by the tag-music recording matrix having zero-one (indicator) vectors of the tags associated with each recording in its columns along with the matrix of the ATM representations in its columns, a low-rank weight matrix is sought, such that the tag-music recording matrix is expressed as the product of the weight matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations plus an error matrix. Clearly, such a weight matrix captures the relationships between the labels (i.e., tags) and the audio features. It can be derived by solving a convex nuclear norm minimization problem, if the tag-music recording matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations are assumed to be jointly low-rank. Having found the weight matrix, the annotation vector for labeling any test music recording can be obtained by multiplying the weight matrix with its ATM representation. The just outlined method is referred to as low-rank representation based multi-label annotation (LRRMA). The LRRMA outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Tags are semantic keywords that are assigned to an image. Image tagging enables the users of social media sharing platforms to annotate images, facilitating image search and content description. Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes.

  abstract  = {The availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. This paper discusses about an approach for automatic annotation in digital images. Some of the previous models for automatic image annotations are translation model (TM), continuous-space relevance model (CRM) and multiple Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM).These models have some semantic gap problems. To avoid these problems here developed a hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which is used to combine both low-level image features and user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based on the low-level image features. Low-level features are color, texture and shape. For images with user provided tags, HPM use both the image features and the tags to recommend additional tags to label the images. Here a Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) is used to capture both color and texture information. An L1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The kernel density estimation is accelerated by an Improved Fast Gauss transform(IFGT).When the number of images becomes larger then Tag-Image Association Matrix (TIAM) used in the HPM framework become very sparse, thus it is very difficult to estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. So a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for tackling this data sparsity issue. Here a CF algorithm is used to find the correlation between the words. Building such a HPM will make image labelling more efficient and less labour intensive.},

  abstract  = {An important aspect when sharing images in social networks is the tags the images are annotated with. Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags. To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 randomly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity.

In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets.

The main goal of tweets classification and linking is to integrate all tweets that are related semantically in one place on the Web. The data inequality problems exist because authors post tweets and hashtag them based on their own preference. The authors can post tweets in different languages (English-Arabic). Therefore, the hashtags cannot be the only trackback function of the tweet to link it with the related tweets. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop an automated tweet classifier which is not limited by the language or the category of the tweet. The approach can create new suggested multilingual (English, Arabic) hashtags from tweet's content and comments "auto-tagging" in social linked open data (LOD), matching the tweets in the same topic and provides high accuracy and performance using blocking and indexing techniques. The proposed framework has substantial improvements in tweets classification and linking compared to state of the art framework of classifying and linking techniques with better classifying rate which reach 95% in precision and 97% in recall.},

In such a multi-label scenario, taking into account correlation between multiple labels can boost the classification accuracy. However, this in turn makes classifier training more challenging because handling multiple labels tends to induce a high-dimensional optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable multi-label classifier based on a computationally efficient classification algorithm called the least-squares probabilistic classifier.

We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for tag recommendation based on users' interest lattice matching (UILM). UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments.},

This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

The focus of the paper is the context of scholarly information literacy, which is here assumed as a variable dependent from the transformations of both the scientific system and its communication processes. After a short excursus on the main ongoing transformations of science, the chapter, adopting a systemic perspective of analysis of both science and its communication processes, identifies some distinctive and functional traits of open science and their potential impact on innovative approaches to scholarly information literacy. },

We analyze this role from two perspectives: the way semantics is encoded in sentiment resources, such as lexica, corpora, and ontologies, and the way it is used by automatic systems that perform sentiment analysis on social media data. Specifically, we review and discuss state-of-the-art methods and tools that rely on semantic models and resources, possibly enabling reasoning, so as to deal with some key challenges for sentiment analysis. Examples of such challenges are context dependency and finer-grained sentiment detection, which can translate into the assigning of sentiment values to aspects of objects or into the design and use of a wider spectrum of affective labels, or the use of current techniques in finer-grained semantic processing. In our dealing with semantics, lexical aspects must be combined with pragmatic and cognitive issues, and other dimensions involved in conveying sentiment, such as emotions. },

  abstract = {The system presented in this article aims to improve information access through the use of semantic annotation utilizing a non-traditional approach. Instead of applying semantic annotations to enhance the internal information access mechanisms, we use them to empower the user of an information access system through an innovative named entity-based user interface – NameSieve. NameSieve was built to support an intelligence analyst during the process of exploratory search, an advanced type of search requiring multiple iterations of retrieval interleaved with browsing and analyzing the retrieved information. The proposed approach was implemented in the NameSieve system so that the system can transparently present a summary of search results in the form of entity “clouds.” Therefore, these clouds allow the analyst to further explore the results in a novel manner, acting together as a faceted browsing interface. We ran a user study (with ten subjects) to examine the effect of NameSieve, and the study results reported in the paper demonstrate that this new way of applying semantic annotation information was actively used and was evaluated positively by the subjects. It enabled the subjects to work more productively and bring back most relevant documents.},

  abstract        = {Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

  abstract        = {Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, such as web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular tools for Web search users to find their desired information. Indeed, the informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. The widely keyword-based approaches used for locating information on the Web, are hence not straightforwardly adaptable to folksonomies. This drawback has created the need for an effective framework to support folksonomy users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this paper is to propose an integrated approach for context-aware query recommendation infolksonomies that exploits the power of both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and triadic concepts. We demonstrate through carried out experiments that the proposed approach yields mainly highly Precise and highly Relevant tag query recommendation.},

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance.

A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users.

One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging services allow users to freely assign tags to resources. As the large majority of users enters only very few tags, good tag recommendation can vastly improve the usability of tags for techniques such as searching, indexing, and clustering. Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

We propose to use the inter-resource consistency as an indicator of indexing quality. The inter-resource consistency measures the degree to which the tag vectors of indexed resources reflect how the users understand the resources. We use this methodology for evaluating how tag recommendations coming from (1) the popular tags at a resource or from (2) the user's own vocabulary influence the indexing quality. We show that recommending popular tags decreases the indexing quality and that recommending the user's own vocabulary increases the indexing quality. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. In this paper an intelligent tag recommendation agent is proposed, that recommends tags for bookmarks stored in one of the popular social bookmarking websites, Del.ici.ou.1 We develop various probabilistic approaches to recommend tags to be used by users while adding new bookmarks. We have developed content-based and collaborative filtering mechanism that are used by these recommendation agents. Additionally, these tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. This approach can therefore be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for social networks. We also empirically verify the hypothesis that similar web pages are tagged with similar tags. We also present a comparison between the proposed recommendation approaches for the agents. © 2012 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {The cross-sections of the Social Web and the Semantic Web has put folksonomy in the spot light for its potential in overcoming knowledge acquisition bottleneck and providing insight for "wisdom of the crowds". Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

In this paper, MTag is presented as a new model for collaborative tagging in medical blogs, i.e. tagging blog entries with medical information. MTag includes two modules: the service module and the semantic module. The service module enables health professionals provide blog posts with auto-completed tags that represent actual medical terms and categorize their tags. Tags are mapped to URIs from online medical knowledge datasets to clarify their medical meaning. At the same time, the semantic module is equipped with a tag ontology which extends the Social Semantic Cloud of Tags (SCOT) ontology to consent medical specifications of tags. Eventually, a prototype is developed to test the MTag's two modules. The results show that both modules are working properly. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

We demonstrate how folksonomies could be adopted for the Sensor Web and other geospatial applications dealing with large volumes of data, by exploiting the geospatial information associated with three key components of such collaborative tagging systems: tags, resources and users. We propose algorithms for: i) suggesting tags for users during the tag input stage; ii) generating tag maps which provides for serendipitous browsing; and iii) personalized searching within the folksonomy. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms using an existing large dataset. An implementation of the folksonomy for the emerging Sensor Web platform is also presented. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Current methods to provide such metadata are impractical for the volume of services published on the Web: they are too expensive to be implemented by a service broker, and too difficult to be used for retrieval. We introduce structured collaborative tagging to address these issues. Here, user tags not only aspects relevant for her but also suggested ones (input, output and behavior). Cost, performance and usability of the proposed technique obtained during the Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest are reported. Obtained results suggests that there is no "free lunch." While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Tags describe the contents of the resource or provide additional contextual and semantical information to make the content more easily browsable and discoverable by others. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and a certain number of resources have no comments, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context. The results of the evaluation show that tag recommendation based on local lexicon is an effective way to improve collaborative resource sharing in social network.},

Automated collaborative document tagging approaches mitigate the problems of manual tagging, but they are usually based on centralized settings which are plagued by problems such as scalability, privacy, etc. To resolve these issues, we present P2P DocTagger, an automated and distributed document tagging system based on classification in P2P networks. P2P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval. In addition, we provide a realistic and flexible simulation toolkit - P2PDMT, to facilitate the development and testing of P2P data mining algorithms. © 2010 VLDB Endowment.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging or collaborative tagging has become a new trend in the organization, management, and discovery of digital information. The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a new knowledge propagation scheme to automatically propagate keywords from a subset of annotated images to the unannotated ones. The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation. Experimental results using 100 concept categories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions. Information channels can be used to explain the effectiveness of individual recommenders or explain the relative contribution of components in the hybrid recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages.

Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored.

Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web.

An important element of collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes a set of tags to each newly posted resource.

Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for "content-based" and "graph-based" recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

The current study aims to study how the intra-personal consistency of tagging can be improved by proper tag visualization. The effects of visualization of tag frequency and visualization of the relevancy among tags on personal tagging consistency are empirically tested and compared through an experiment with 39 participants. The results show that visualization of tag relevancy improves tagging consistency significantly and reduces mental workload simultaneously; visualization of tag frequency may alleviate perceived physical demand when tag relevancy is visualized.

Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

  abstract      = {Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters.

In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

  abstract      = {This paper presents an in-depth study of the social tagging mechanisms used in Freesound.org, an online community where users share and browse audio files by means of tags and content-based audio similarity search. We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers. Our results are supported by extensive experiments on del.icio.us datasets. © 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms.

In this paper, we propose a tag recommender which relies on the content analysis of the resource to be tagged, as well as on the personal and collective tagging history. The main contribution of this work is a model which combines semantic content analysis methods with existing suggestive tagging techniques.

Being the scenario similar to traditional recommender systems where nearest neighbor algorithms, better known as collaborative filtering, were extensively and successfully applied, the application of the same methods to the problem of tag recommendation seems to be a natural way to follow. However, it is necessary to take into consideration some particularities of these systems, such as the absence of ratings and the fact that two entity types in a rating scale correspond to three top level entity types, i.e., user, resources and tags. In this paper we cast the tag recommendation problem into a collaborative filtering perspective and starting from a view on the plain recommendation task without attributes, we make a ground evaluation comparing different tag recommender algorithms on real data.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique.

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

By implementing I-VIDI based on functional requirements, we have showed how I-VIDI reduces problems found from current image classification methods such as KJ clustering and MDS.

Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Recent literature observes that recommendations rarely occur within such isolation and that there may be potential within more socially-orientated approaches. With KeepUP, we outline the design of a recommendation process that is based on an implicit social network where the relevancy and meaning of information can be negotiated not only with the recommender system but also with other users.

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare two recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, We show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods.

Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

Vocabulary control and thesaurus construction are studied in the context of creating subject trees as structured browsing environments. Then practical, user-centred taxonomy creation and maintenance are explored. The concept of ontology in the context of information management is explained. Finally, collaborative classification and the impact of user-generated content to provide an additional level of organisation to web-based information are discussed. },

The system attempts to annotate Web resources according to the available taxonomical relations using simple annotation schemes. The system is completely autonomous if the chosen golden ontology is provided by linguistic experts as it happens for WordNet.

However, most WSDL documents lack contents, which lead to great limitation for service tag mining. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to retrieve and extract service tags by leveraging information from the Internet. Our approach retrieves service related web pages by searching online for the URL of the services, then executes a Vector Space Model (VSM) based procedure to fulfill structure analysis and content extraction of the pages, finally mines service related tags together with WSDL documents. Experiments on real web services demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which is able to extract more number of abundant and meaningful tags.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community Web sites.},

  abstract  = {Tags pose an efficient and effective way of organization of resources, but they are not always available. A technique called SCM/THD investigated in this paper extracts entities from free-text annotations, and using the Lin similarity measure over the WordNet thesaurus classifies them into a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hypernyms extracted from Wikipedia are used to map uncommon entities to Wordnet synsets. In collaborative environments, users can assign multiple annotations to the same object hence increasing the amount of information available. Assuming that the semantics of the annotations overlap, this redundancy can be exploited to generate higher quality tags. A preliminary experiment presented in the paper evaluates the consistency and quality of tags generated from multiple annotations of the same image. The results obtained on an experimental dataset comprising of 62 annotations from four annotators show that the accuracy of a simple majority vote surpasses the average accuracy obtained through assessing the annotations individually by 18%. A moderate-strength correlation has been found between the quality of generated tags and the consistency of annotations.},

This paper investigates these pervasive annotation technologies and discusses their usage in the personalized services such as recommendation and presentation. We design and implement a pervasive annotation system (PAS) using service component architecture (SCA). The application of this system shows that PAS can help user manage the Web resources more conveniently and efficiently by pervasive annotation, and get required Web resource recommended through information filtering.},

Knowledge recommender system (KRS) is an efficient way to decrease information overload, and the user model is very critical for KRS. This paper proposes a method to establish a user model based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In detail, we first select the keywords from knowledge databases, and then represent knowledge items with Vector Space Model (VSM). Next, for a certain user, the VSM of all scanned knowledge items and related scores rated by the user are combined together to be a new matrix, named as Vector Space Model with Rating(VSMR,with dimension of m times n), where the first n-1 columns represent the VSM of the items, and the final column lists the scores given by the user. And then the GMM-based user model is trained with VSMR. Finally, the trained user model is used to predict the user's ratings on the knowledge items and the items with the higher score are considered as user's interest, which will be recommended to the user. The proposed method is validated by two experiments, which indicate that the method works well.},

However, the applicability of many solutions developed in this field is hampered by the costs associated with semantically annotating large repositories of Web services. To overcome this gap we propose a practical method for semantically annotating collections of XML Schemas and Web service interfaces. We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.},

  abstract  = {Tagging technique is widely used to annotate objects in Web 2.0 applications. Tags can support web service understanding, categorizing and discovering, which are important tasks in a service-oriented software system. However, most of existing web services' tags are annotated manually. Manual tagging is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tag web services automatically. Our approach consists of two tagging strategies, tag enriching and tag extraction. In the first strategy, we cluster web services using WSDL documents, and then we enrich tags for a service with the tags of other services in the same cluster. Considering our approach may not generate enough tags by tag enriching, we also extract tags from WSDL documents and related descriptions in the second step. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, a series of experiments are carried out based on web-scale web services. The experimental results show that our tagging method is effective, ensuring the number and quality of generated tags. We also show how to use tagging results to improve the performance of a web service search engine, which can prove that our work in this paper is useful and meaningful.},

Taking advantage of the repetitive nature of modern information and online media databases with independent annotation instances, we present an approach to automatically annotate multimedia documents that uses mining techniques to discover new annotations from similar documents and to filter existing incorrect annotations. The annotation set is not limited to words that have training data or for which models have been created. It is limited only by the words in the collective annotation vocabulary of all the database documents. A graph reinforcement method driven by a particular modality (e.g., visual) is used to determine the contribution of a similar document to the annotation target. The graph supplies possible annotations of a different modality (e.g., text) that can be mined for annotations of the target. Experiments are performed using videos crawled from YouTube. A customized precision-recall metric shows that the annotations obtained using the proposed method are superior to those originally existing for the document. These extended, filtered tags are also superior to a state-of-the-art semi-supervised technique for graph reinforcement learning on the initial user-supplied annotations.},

In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities. We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities.

To deal with the problem, numerous approaches employed semantic techniques in terms of annotation (or tagging) and service discovery algorithms. However, the problem of semantic service discovery based on the identification of fine-grained goals of users and services is still challenging due to the lack of semantic information in Web services. To enable the goal-driven semantic service discovery, we propose an automatic functional-goals tagging approach which employs a set of natural language processing (NLP) procedures based on the descriptions of Web services. In addition, to check the effectiveness of the functional-goals tagged, we designed a goal-driven semantic service discovery algorithm and compared it with other approaches: keyword-based, ontology-based, and topic-based service discovery. As results, our proposed goal-driven semantic service discovery achieved 75.7% of precision and 59.6% of recall (finally, F1=62%) that outperform other discovery approaches.},

Can these biases be used to improve existing automated image tagging systems? We show that tag ordering, which has been largely overlooked by the image tagging community, is an important cue in understanding user tagging behavior and can be used to improve auto-tagging systems. Inspired by the assumption that people order their tags, we propose a new way of measuring tag preferences, and also propose a new personalized tagging objective function that explicitly considers a user's preferred tag orderings. We also provide a (partially) greedy algorithm that produces good solutions to our new objective and under certain conditions produces an optimal solution. We validate our method on a subset of Flickr images that spans 5000 users, over 5200 tags, and over 90,000 images. Our experiments show that exploiting personalized tag orders improves the average performance of state-of-art approaches both on per-image and per-user bases.},

In this paper, we address the problem of diversified coverage based tag recommendation. To our best knowledge, it is first proposed in the context of tag recommendation. Since the NP-hardness of the problem, a greedy based diversified coverage tag recommendation algorithm, namely GDC, is proposed. First, it constructs a semantic similarity graph based on the local and global tag co-occurrence matrices, which improves the recommendation accuracy by incorporating both the user's interests and the popularity of tags. Further, GDC recursively searches the MIDS (Minimum Independent Dominating Set) in an efficient manner together with an effective pruning rule. The experiments conducted on the real datasets of MovieLens and Last.fm show that the proposed GDC improve the diversity significantly.},

Since large amounts of documents and code in GitHub repositories are in a mess, users cannot search or understand them efficiently. One solution is to employ a tag system, which annotates each repository with several tags. Thus, the GitHub repositories can be more efficiently accessed and understood. However, GitHub does not provide any automated tools of tagging repositories. In order to tackle this problem, we propose GRETA, a novel graph-based approach to assigning tags for repositories on GitHub. The core insight of GRETA is (1) to construct an Entity-Tag Graph (ETG) for GitHub using the domain knowledge from StackOverflow, and (2) to assign tags for repositories by taking a random walk algorithm. We have implemented GRETA and also developed a repository search engine for GitHub using the tag assignment results of GRETA. We have evaluated GRETA against several baseline methods to investigate its effectiveness of tagging GitHub repositories. The results show GRETA achieves up to 35% of F-Measure, outperforming the baseline methods. Besides, the GRETA-based search engine gains a higher NDCG value than the search engine provided by GitHub, indicating that it significantly enhances the search ability on GitHub with the tagged repositories.},

Attackers usually leverage the popumobile smart phoneslarity of Android apps by inserting malwares, modifying the original apps, repackaging and releasing them for their own illegal purposes. To avoid repackaged apps from being detected, they usually use sorts of obfuscation and encryption tools. As a result, it's important to detect which apps are repackaged. People often intuitively judge whether two apps are a repackaged pair by executing them and observing their runtime user interface (UI) traces. Hence, we propose layout group graph (LGG) built from UI trances to model those UI behaviors and use LGG as the birthmark of Android apps for identification. Based on LGG, we also implement a dynamic repackaging detection tool, RepDroid. Since our method does not require the apps' source code, it is resilient to app obfuscation and encryption. We conducted an experiment with two data sets. The first set contains 98 pairs of repackaged apps. The original apps and repackaged ones are compared and we can detect all of these repackaged pairs. The second set contains 125 commercial apps. We compared them pair-wisely and the false positive rate was 0.08%.},

Our model builds upon the fact that the visual content and user tags of pictures can provide significant hints about their geo-locations. Using a large collection of over a million geotagged photographs, we build location probability maps of user tags over the entire globe. These maps reflect the picture-taking and tagging behaviors of thousands of users from all over the world, and reveal interesting tag map patterns. Visual content matching is performed using multiple feature descriptors including tiny images, color histograms, GIST features, and bags of textons. The combination of visual content matching and local tag probability maps forms a strong geo-inference engine.

  abstract  = {This paper provides a general introduction to the concept of implicit human-centered tagging (IHCT) - the automatic extraction of tags from nonverbal behavioral feedback of media users. The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be "implicit". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented). The paper discusses these issues in detail and provides an overview of pioneering efforts in the field.},

  abstract  = {GitHub contains millions of repositories among which many are similar with one another (i.e., having similar source codes or implementing similar functionalities). Finding similar repositories on GitHub can be helpful for software engineers as it can help them reuse source code, build prototypes, identify alternative implementations, explore related projects, find projects to contribute to, and discover code theft and plagiarism. Previous studies have proposed techniques to detect similar applications by analyzing API usage patterns and software tags. However, these prior studies either only make use of a limited source of information or use information not available for projects on GitHub. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can effectively detect similar repositories on GitHub. Our approach is designed based on three heuristics leveraging two data sources (i.e., GitHub stars and readme files) which are not considered in previous works. The three heuristics are: repositories whose readme files contain similar contents are likely to be similar with one another, repositories starred by users of similar interests are likely to be similar, and repositories starred together within a short period of time by the same user are likely to be similar. Based on these three heuristics, we compute three relevance scores (i.e., readme-based relevance, stargazer-based relevance, and time-based relevance) to assess the similarity between two repositories. By integrating the three relevance scores, we build a recommendation system called RepoPal to detect similar repositories. We compare RepoPal to a prior state-of-the-art approach CLAN using one thousand Java repositories on GitHub. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RepoPal achieves a higher success rate, precision and confidence over CLAN.},

A system developed using the proposed models is adaptive (adapts the recommended tags to the existing set of tags), has a feedback (after each tagging, the set of tags and the dictionary are updated), is personalized (each user develops its own set of tags), and is semantics-aware (uses an ontology to refine tags).

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tag recommendation algorithm, which can be used in the large-scale and real-time data process effectively and efficiently. Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.},

On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones. In the experiments, the developed recommender system is tested on two different data sets; and the experiment results indicate that this system is more effective than CoFiDS, a typical recommender system offering soft ratings.},

These systems achieved widespread success on the Web on account of the simplicity for organizing resources using open-ended tags. Recently, tag recommendation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problems of ambiguity, syntactic variations and noise in tags cause by the inherent characteristics of natural language. In this work we proposed a content-based approach that generates a list of suggested tags for annotating a given resource starting from an analysis of its textual content exclusively. Thus, the proposed method can be used in situations in which there is not enough information for creating a tag-based user profile or compare the user with others. For extracting the more relevant words different term weighting approaches were evaluated, particularly considering the HTML structure of Web pages and the grammatical category of words in order to determine promising tag candidates. Experimental results of applying this technique to tag recommendation using several term weighting approaches are reported and compared.},

Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

This paper presents a novel method that overcomes this problem by automatically generating an annotated corpus based on a specific ontology.

Moreover, rather than pursuing rule-based methods as in literature, we employ a machine learning model to not only disambiguate but also identify named entities. In addition, our method explores in details the use of a range of features extracted from texts, a given ontology, and Wikipedia data for disambiguation. This paper also systematically analyzes impacts of the features on disambiguation accuracy by varying their combinations for representing named entities. Empirical evaluation shows that, while the ontology provides basic features of named entities, Wikipedia is a fertile source for additional features to construct accurate and robust named entity disambiguation systems.},

A latent reason can be any discrete features of the document (such as words) or a global noise variable. Inferring the reason for each tag helps TAM reduce the ambiguity of a document with multiple tags. By introducing noise as a reason, TAM can handle noise tags naturally. We perform experiments on three real world data sets. The results show that TAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both held-out perplexity and tag recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with modern sensors and sensor-based devices, will significantly stimulate the development of context-aware applications. An effective means to extract higher-level contextual information from sensor data is distributed complex event processing (CEP), which facilitates the analysis of real-time data streams coming from heterogeneous and distributed sources. Considering that user context is inherently sensitive information, the preservation of privacy is critical once the processing of user context takes place over several (possibly malicious) devices, especially in collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a trust-based approach for the placement and execution of CEP operators in a distributed environment. We propose a trust management model based on communication interactions among the users. Furthermore, we incorporate trust recommendations using a cosine-based similarity check in order to overcome collusion and on-off attacks. We developed a smartphone-based distributed CEP system called TrustCEP to evaluate our approach for trust management. Based on the evaluation of TrustCEP, we observe that our approach induces a minimal increase in average battery consumption compared to privacy-negligent approaches.},

The current recommendation system provided through Google and the Google Play store presumably recommends applications similar to a target application while accounting for the popularity of each application. However, it does not take the security features of each application or users preferences into consideration when doing so. In this paper, we propose DroidVisor, an Android tool that provides users with fine-grained and customizable application recommendations. Compared to the Google store recommendation function, DroidVisor does not only use the similarity to a preselected target application, but also considers other metrics such as popularity, security, and usability. More specifically, DroidVisor provides an interface for users to configure the weight of each metric and a recommendation algorithm that generates a list of recommended applications based on the combined scores. We evaluate our proposed criteria and the quality of recommendation through use case studies. Finally, we present our findings through a discussion of accuracy as well as possible ways to improve our recommendation results.},

  abstract  = {As a social bookmark tool, Folksonomy gives high freedom to users and allows users to share and notate resources. However, many tags applied arbitrarily by users can not really reflect the contents of web pages and lead to ineffectiveness in information retrieval. Moreover, there are still some important tasks about how to eliminate ambiguity more easily and recommend more interested web pages to users. To resolve the above problems, we propose a novel mechanism named SSTAG, and it can recommend a set of Super-tags to users for their choices based on keywords input. As various topics related to the keywords, the Super-tags are selected from different clusters of web pages related to the keywords. A user chooses a Super-tag, which means the user may have chosen an interested topic, and then some more detailed tags in the topic are recommended as Sub-tags. The relationship between Super-tag and Sub-tag is just like navigation and positioning. Likewise, the user can choose one Sub-tag and submit it with the Super-tag. By means of the user's choice, this system can capture users' preference and recommend a series of related web pages. We employ a real world dataset to examine the mechanism, and the experimental results show that this mechanism can eliminate ambiguity efficiently and recommend a set of appropriate tags.},

Besides, a sizeable amount of information sources are now available in electronic or digital format, and Internet has become an important source of information. Not only the existing libraries and their services are now being automated, libraries of new varieties, such as digital libraries and virtual libraries are also coming up. The main areas where efforts are being made to apply computers for increasing the efficiency and speed in the field of information organization are indexing; abstracting; information retrieval tools like thesaurus, ontology, folksonomy, and folksontology; translation; and language processing. These efforts have been briefly discussed in this chapter. },

The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label products in a collection using a free vocabulary. The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users. This experience showed that TagProfiles are easier to understand and modify by users, allowing them to discover new movies as they interact with their profiles.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

The proposed methods are evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient than previous methods, which are appropriate for a large number of web resources.

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments.

Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.},

But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

The multi-agent systems paradigm coordinated by selforganisation mechanisms has been used as an effective way for the design and modeling of such systems. Existing tagging systems do not take full advantage of their complex systems characteristics, especially in adapting to their environment and allowing emergence. In this paper, we propose a model for designing a tagging system, using a multi-agent system approach, governed by the co-evolution of the social and spatial organisations of the agents. We show how the proposed system has new functionalities that could enhance current collaborative tagging systems. © 2008 IEEE.},

There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Tagging is a process whereby users freely choose keywords to label web objects in order to share or recover them later. Tags associated to an object by the user depict his viewpoint or perception. The perception of the target user can be enhanced by aggregating and analyzing the tags associated to an object by other users who share at least one tag with the target user in common for that object and recommending tags to him. Most of the existing techniques recommend tags on the basis of their popularity among the users. The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes. To observe the performance of our approach, experiments are carried out on the data collected from del.icio.us, a social book marking site that allows the users to tag URLs and share them with other people. © 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system provides relevance searching, which is more effective than traditional keyword searching for searching personal resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

They lead to an emergent categorization of web resources in terms of tags, and create a different kind of web directory. However, the current ways of exploration in the tagging space are limited, which cannot get the most out of the real value of it.

Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users' Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In social tagging system, a user annotates a tag to an item. The tagging information is utilized in recommendation process. In this paper, we propose a hybrid item recommendation method to mitigate limitations of existing approaches and propose a recommendation framework for social tagging systems. The proposed framework consists of tag and item recommendations. Tag recommendation helps users annotate tags and enriches the dataset of a social tagging system. Item recommendation utilizes tags to recommend relevant items to users. We investigate association rule, bigram, tag expansion, and implicit trust relationship for providing tag and item recommendations on the framework. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid item recommendation method generates more appropriate items than existing research studies on a real-world social tagging dataset.},
