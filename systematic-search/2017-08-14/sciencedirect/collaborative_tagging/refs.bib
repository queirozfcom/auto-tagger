abstract = "Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300–500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways."

Users expect to be able to connect with information in ways that are different from what was typical in the early or pre-Internet world where people were restricted to playing the role of information consumer. This shift from passive consumption to active interaction has important implications in terms of information and knowledge management. These implications, particularly when applied to the work environment, have raised new challenges within information and knowledge management – challenges that are best addressed through the application of digital curation. Digital curation is a developing field within information science, situated at the intersection of information management, knowledge management, communication and technology.

These online applications allow for a kind of functionality and interactivity that have so far been exclusively reserved for desktop applications; they can hence be considered as a materialization of the network computer (i.e., the “NC” as opposed to the PC, the personal computer) that had first been predicted in the mid-1990s. Several \{RIAs\} are described to show their characteristics. Mash-ups, roughly implement the idea of bringing multiple services or sources of content together in one place in order to form a new, often valued-added service. One example of mash-ups is Google Maps, a service from which map information can be obtained in order to mash it up, say, with textual address information in order to make it more lively and visual. Through tagging, i.e., user-generated keywords or metadata attachable to Web resources. This allows users to attach any number of keywords to an object or a Web resource, which could be an entire Web site, a photo, or a link. This is meant to ease their storing of and searching through these objects. "

Examples of types of business metadata that require special capture mechanisms from businesspeople are business terms, definitions of business terms, linking of business terms to the data elements of one or more systems, business rules, optimal ways of performing the job (“knowledge artifacts”; knowledge encyclopedia entries), and categorization (of business terms, documents, web pages, etc.). The chapter begins by discussing why knowledge capture is so important. Business metadata, after all, exists for businesspeople to use, and it should reflect their point of view. There has to be a way (and a place) to capture their perspective so that it can be accessed by other businesspeople. This chapter attempts to define what the corporate knowledge base really is and how it represents this business point of view. Following this, the discussion extends to encourage businesspeople to share their valuable insights and information and presents various technologies that can support knowledge capture. In addition, the chapter covers the subject of capturing knowledge from both individuals and groups or communities of users. The interesting aspect of metadata or knowledge capture from individuals is the ability of the individual to directly benefit from this exercise. A special kind of stewardship called “Governance Lite” which presents one way to balance the need for some governance with knowledge capture requirements is explored. In the process, this chapter investigates some of the unique features of the knowledge capture culture as it pertains to governance. The role of publicity in encouraging people to share their valuable knowledge is also discussed. Individual knowledge capture is revisited, and practical ideas are presented to help one be more productive in capturing one's moments of brilliance and insight so one can remember them later. "

One key development, dating from about 2009, is the desire by senior politicians for the public to become more involved with government through online interaction. Taken to its extreme, theoretically, all major decisions could be made by citizens effectively instantaneously, by online voting. The information technology that is the subject of this book is Web 2.0, which concerns the ability to share information on the web, for users, especially the general public, to collaborate. The significance of Web 2.0 is outlined, and the participation–collaboration pattern, the declarative living pattern and the tag gardening pattern are explained.

Major areas where corporations are looking at e-discovery and changes to its landscape include: focus on litigation preparedness, emergence of better enterprise searches, centralization of e-discovery activities and actions, insourcing the e-discovery review process, emergence of folksonomies, record accessibility and retention policies, centralization of e-discovery activities and actions, and complications from “e-discovery trolls.” In corporations worldwide, but especially in the United States, there is an increased focus on being prepared to respond to and vigorously defend matters surrounding pending litigation. Particularly with regard to the recently amended Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and the new requirements in e-discovery, counsel and companies are paying new attention to both how to avoid and how to respond to lawsuits. New enterprise search platform features are emerging to integrate with litigation support software to help corporations get their arms around their data. These platforms are offering advances such as conceptual search, automatic categorization, and advanced algorithms. E-discovery trolls are emerging and making up a newly significant threat to firms. This really hinges on the emergence of the new \{FRCP\} code as it pertains to e-discovery. Folksonomic tagging allows users to create their own tags, which are freely chosen and not part of a strictly controlled vocabulary. This type of social tagging is sure to make e-discovery search and review efforts easier. The spiraling costs of e-discovery are prompting more corporate legal teams—the in-house counsel—to do more e-discovery work in-house. Another trend for e-discovery in the coming few years is automated review. "

Information is provided to assist the researcher to identify the optimal tag for their species and size range and to develop and execute an optimal tagging procedure and program that is tailored to the study objectives and the nature of the fishery including the tag-recovery phase. This chapter discusses a range of articles that have utilized conventional and radio frequency identification tags in stock identification and movement studies across a range of crustacean, mollusk, and finfish species with an emphasis on the latter. Information is also provided on recent advances in tagging data analysis for movement rate studies. "

This results in post-hoc metadata with each user contributing, via a network effect, to metadata diversity. However, standards-based, a priori, metadata restricts users’ involvement and ensures consistent structures and quality. These approaches though, are not necessarily in opposition. Combining both, into a mixed metadata system, unlocks the potential for metadata diversity and scalability whilst maintaining hierarchical and semantic structure. This changes the underlying principles for metadata systems, to consider variable user participation, aggregation and provenance, along with a change in the definition of quality so that it focuses on findability or usefulness.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This article focuses on Semantic Web, which is another important Web development, besides Web 2.0, that has emerged roughly since 2001. Tim Berners-Lee and others wrote in their famous paper “The Semantic Web—A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities” in the Scientific American that the Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data on the Web defined and linked in a way that it can be used by machines not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration, and reuse of data across various applications. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. A comparison of the features available through Web 2.0 technology, in particular, social bookmarking, tagging, and folksonomies, with Semantic Web developments such as taxonomies and ontologies, is presented. The possible augmentations and enhancements to traditional search engines and data integration are the core idea of the Semantic. A considerable number of techniques and approaches to deal with data integration problems, that fall in two basic categories: virtual integration and materialized integration. Materialized systems include search engines with their index, but also data warehouses as used in online analytical processing (OLAP) applications. Virtual systems include meta search engines such as Mamma, multidatabase systems as well as systems building on so called mediated integration. Languages at the core of Semantic Web development include \{RDF\} (the Resource Description Framework), \{RDF\} Schema (RDFS, a schema specification language), and \{OWL\} (Web Ontology Language). "
