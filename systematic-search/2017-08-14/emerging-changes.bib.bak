  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

In this approach learning objectspsila creators use a metadata schema that is extended with new categories as more and more learning objects are tagged. These new categories are made available for the rest of the creatorspsila community. The approach also lets creators restructure metadata schemas. The mechanism is also powerful enough to reify (and therefore to interoperate with) existing metadata specifications (e.g. LOM). We have tested this approach in Chasqui, a system for the production and deployment of repositories of learning objects in specialized domains, where metadata are exploited during navigation and search.},

In this paper, we apply a statistical approach for discovering topic-specific bursts from a popular CTS - del.icio.us. This approach allows trend discovery from different components of the system such as users, tags, and resources. Based on the detected topic bursts, we perform a preliminary analysis of related burst formation patterns. Our findings indicate that users and resources contributing to the bursts can be classified into two categories: old and new, based on their past usage histories. This classification scheme leads to interesting empirical findings. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract  = {We propose a method for the detection of trends in social bookmarking systems. Compared to other work in this emerging field, our approach has a more sound statistical basis. In order to cope with the problem of vanishing probabilities due to data sparsity, we apply smoothing and show that it allows for an easy calibration of our trend detector resulting in better generalization and scalability. We test our approach on a collection of 105, 000, 000 bookmarks collected from the del.icio.us bookmarking service. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of a real world bookmarking service analyzed in this context. The results show that our method outperforms previously proposed methods and successfully detects trends in the data.},
