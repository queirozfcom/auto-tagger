  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

In this approach learning objectspsila creators use a metadata schema that is extended with new categories as more and more learning objects are tagged. These new categories are made available for the rest of the creatorspsila community. The approach also lets creators restructure metadata schemas. The mechanism is also powerful enough to reify (and therefore to interoperate with) existing metadata specifications (e.g. LOM). We have tested this approach in Chasqui, a system for the production and deployment of repositories of learning objects in specialized domains, where metadata are exploited during navigation and search.},

This approach allows trend discovery from different components of the system such as users, tags, and resources. Based on the detected topic bursts, we perform a preliminary analysis of related burst formation patterns. Our findings indicate that users and resources contributing to the bursts can be classified into two categories: old and new, based on their past usage histories. This classification scheme leads to interesting empirical findings. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In order to cope with the problem of vanishing probabilities due to data sparsity, we apply smoothing and show that it allows for an easy calibration of our trend detector resulting in better generalization and scalability. We test our approach on a collection of 105, 000, 000 bookmarks collected from the del.icio.us bookmarking service. To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of a real world bookmarking service analyzed in this context. The results show that our method outperforms previously proposed methods and successfully detects trends in the data.},

The new developments in the collaborative and participatory role of web emerges new knowledge structures driving the need towards Web based indicators for studying the diffusion of knowledge on Web. We present the results of an exploratory case-study investigating the tagging and citing practices for the WWW `06 conference papers. We observed two important patterns: (1) Papers which got heavily tagged in all three applications Delicious, Citeulike and Bibsonomy (average total tags > 6) generally achieved a high number of citations. We also observed that most of the tags were from 2006 and most of the citations were from 2007. This indicated that tags may hold the potential of foretelling the future volume of regenerative diffusion of research. (2) Terms appearing in tag-clouds of highly tagged papers in 2006 reappear frequently in the titles of respective citing papers in 2007. This shows that tag clouds may have the potential of forecasting the context of diffusion as well. It furthermore indicates that the users tag the papers with multiple tags according to their specific contexts of use as well as content of that knowledge artifact. Based on these patterns we propose that tags may be used as a supplementary indicator to model the diffusion of knowledge on Web.},

The proposed methodology is based on the use of bibliometrics; i.e., analysis is conducted using information regarding trends and patterns of publication. While using bibliometric techniques in this way is not a new idea, the proposed approach extends previous studies in a number of important ways. Firstly, instead of being purely exploratory, the focus of our research has been on developing techniques for detecting technologies that are in the early growth phase, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of relevant publications. Secondly, to increase the reliability of the forecasting effort, we propose the use of automatically generated keyword taxonomies, allowing the growth potentials of subordinate technologies to be aggregated into the overall potential of larger technology categories. A proof-of-concept implementation of each component of the framework is presented, and is used to study the domain of renewable energy technologies. Results from this analysis are presented and discussed.},

As social networks become more and more popular and some specialize on certain topics, information about users' music tastes becomes available and easy to exploit. In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},
