  abstract  = {The knowledge contained in digital lectures and articles used in eLearning platforms like Moodle and Blackboard, is creating new demands for intelligent retrieval mechanisms. One basic approach in support of such retrieval mechanisms is the generation of semantic annotation, based on ontologies describing both the field and the structure of the texts themselves. Many current approaches use statistical methods similar to the ones employed by Google to find correlations within the texts. While successful and efficient, this approach fails to take advantage of the additional information provided by the structure of the sources, or, i.e. the upper ontology used by the author. mArachna is based on natural language processing techniques, taking advantage of characteristic linguistic structures defined by the language used in mathematical texts. It creates a knowledge base from the mathematical relations presented in a text, mapping the ontology onto the structure of the knowledge base.},

An interesting outcome is that the characteristic qualities of these systems seem to be inverse to more traditional knowledge structuring approaches like taxonomies or ontologies: The latter provide rich and precise semantics, but suffer - amongst others - from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. An important step towards exploiting the possible synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy. This position paper presents preliminary results of ongoing work to induce hierarchical relationships among tags by analyzing the aggregated data of collaborative tagging systems as a basis for an ontology learning procedure.},

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including whether coherent categorization schemes can emerge from unsupervised tagging by users. This paper uses data from the social bookmarking site delicio. us to examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we examine whether the distribution of the frequency of use of tags for "popular" sites with a long history (many tags and many users) can be described by a power law distribution, often characteristic of what are considered complex systems. We produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to understand the basic dynamics behind tagging, including how a power law distribution of tags could arise. We empirically examine the tagging history of sites in order to determine how this distribution arises over time and to determine the patterns prior to a stable distribution. Lastly, by focusing on the high-frequency tags of a site where the distribution of tags is a stabilized power law, we show how tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags can be used to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags.},

Semantic annotation of the provided information is necessary to support the user in retrieving and filtering requested information. Wide-spread tools like Google have shown both the power and the limitations of statistical methods based on correlations between terms within texts. The KEA system uses a different approach. Natural language processing techniques, taking advantage of characteristic linguistic structures defined by the language used in mathematical texts, are utilized in the automatic extraction of ontologies from mathematical texts. As a result, the system creates a base of the mathematical relations and concepts by mapping the extracted ontologies on the structure of a data base. To support the retrieval and further refinement of the data stored within this mathematical knowledge base, KEA implements a number of Web 2.0 technologies in a desktop style interface. The following article presents the technology and applications of the KEA system.},

For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

The number of these resources has increased enormously within organisations over time and with an increasing variety of quality standards, maturity and granularity of resources, the description of content with metadata becomes more and more challenging. Automatic extraction services and professional metadata authoring tools could not deliver the expected results. Therefore, this research project investigated and discussed collaborative tagging as a means to successfully tag KLR. This paper presents results of an online survey distributed to first-year Information Systems students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The results report on the study's key themes of commitment and convergence towards generally accepted collaborative tags. Commitment and convergence could be confirmed, but there is a need for further exploration with a higher number of participants. Collaborative tagging is suggested as a solution to facilitate the development of ontologies for describing organisational metadata. © 2008 Ronald Maier, Silke Retzer and Stefan Thalmann.},

Conventional tags, meaning freely created tags that are not associated with a structured ontology, are not naturally suited for collaborative processes, due to linguistic and grammatical variations, as well as human typing errors. Additionally, tags reflect personal views of the world by individual users, and are not normalised for synonymy, morphology or any other mapping. Our view is that the conventional approach provides very limited semantic value for collaboration. Moreover, in cases where there is some semantic value, automatically sharing semantics via computer manipulations is extremely problematic. This paper explores these problems by discussing approaches for collaborative tagging activities at a semantic level, and presenting conceptual models for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies. We present criteria for the comparison of existing tag ontologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in relation to these criteria.},

  abstract        = {Social annotation via so-called collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of unstructured keywords to shared content. In this paper, we explore and study social annotations and tagging with regard to their usefulness for web document classification by an analysis of large sets of real-world data. We are interested in finding out which kinds of documents are annotated more by end users than others, how users tend to annotate these documents, and in particular how this user-generated folksonomy compares with a top-down taxonomy maintained by classification experts for the same set of documents. We describe what can be deduced from the results for further research and development in the areas of document classification and information retrieval. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

Such a system can be naturally represented as a tri-partite graph whose nodes represent papers, users and tags connected by individual tag assignments. The semantics of tags is studied here, in order to uncover the hidden relationships between tags. We find that the clustering coefficient can be used to analyze the semantical patterns among tags. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The social semantic Web has recently emerged as a paradigm in which ontologies (aimed at defining, structuring and sharing information) and collaborative software (used for creating and sharing knowledge) have been merged together. Ontologies provide an effective means of capturing and integrating knowledge for feedback provisioning, while using collaborative activities can support pedagogical theories, such as social constructivism. Both technologies have developed separately in the e-learning domain; representing respectively a teacher-centered and a learner-centered approach for learning environments. In this paper we bridge the gap between these two approaches by leveraging the social semantic Web paradigm, and propose a collaborative semantic-rich learning environment in which folksonomies created from studentspsila collaborative tags contribute to ontology maintenance, and teacher-directed feedback.},
