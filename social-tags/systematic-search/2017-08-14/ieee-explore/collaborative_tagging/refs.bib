year={2011},
pages={1-8},
abstract={Despite the regular updates of the existing discovery techniques, the discovery of Web services continues to exacerbate users due to the large number of available Web services on the Internet. Different needs trigger the discovery of Web services such as developing new, value-added composite services and sustaining the high availability of other peers. These needs reveal three types of relationships between Web services, which are substitution, competition, and collaboration. The proposed framework includes tools that capture and update these relationships into social networks so that Web services discovery can be made smooth. Some implementation and simulation details are, also, discussed in this paper.},

abstract={We discuss the results of a study on characterizing interpersonal social relationships in terms of their emotional intensity and valence in the context of several preliminary studies on the representation of social relations and the detection and characterization of individual relationships from online communication. A common aspect of these studies is the conclusion that the in-depth analysis of social relations is a hard problem, which cannot be solved by simple application of methods from the fields of social network analysis, NLP, or machine learning. We attempt to identify the contributing factors to the complexity of the problem, pointing out directions for future research.},

year={2009},
pages={12-22},
abstract={Empirical research on collaborative software development practices indicates that technical and social aspects of software development are often intertwined. The processes followed are tacit and constantly evolving, thus not all of them are amenable to formal tool support. In this paper, we explore how ldquotaggingrdquo, a lightweight social computing mechanism, is used to bridge the gap between technical and social aspects of managing work items. We present the results from an empirical study on how tagging has been adopted and adapted over the past two years of a large project with 175 developers. Our research shows that the tagging mechanism was eagerly adopted by the team, and that it has become a significant part of many informal processes. Our findings indicate that lightweight informal tool support, prevalent in the social computing domain, may play an important role in improving team-based software development practices.},

title={A Probabilistic Topic Model for Mashup Tag Recommendation},
year={2016},
pages={444-451},
abstract={Mashups are prevalent Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) based applications consisting of multiple Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and content. Tags have been extensively used to organize and index mashup services. However, people favor manual tags creation in the past. This approach demands user intervention, which is extremely time-consuming and probes to errors. In this paper we propose a novel Mashup-API-Tag model for automatic mashup tag recommendation. The model simultaneously incorporates the composition relationships between mashups and APIs as well as the annotation relationships between APIs and tags to discover the latent topics. Then the semantic similarity between Web APIs and mashups can be acquired. Subsequently, tags of chosen APIs are recommended to a mashup where the mashup and the APIs are most similar. In addition, we develop a tag filtering algorithm to select the most relevant tags for recommendation. The experimental results on a real world dataset prove that our approach outperforms other methods, including frequency-based methods and the methods that only consider the composition relationships and the annotation relationships separately.},

abstract={A hierarchical multi-agent system that exploits one (or more) semantic lexicon for performing semantic markup of Web resources is presented. Semantic lexicon is considered here as a golden ontology defining taxonomical relations among concepts such as hypernymy, meronymy, holonymy and so forth. The system attempts to annotate Web resources according to the available taxonomical relations using simple annotation schemes. The system is completely autonomous if the chosen golden ontology is provided by linguistic experts as it happens for WordNet.

year={2016},
pages={135-141},
abstract={Most of the file systems today are based on desktop metaphor utilizing hierarchies of folders and sub-folders for information storage and retrieval. A folder is usually assumed to store the semantically related information in the form of files and sub-folders. However, there always exist related files somewhere else in the local file system hierarchy. Users often fail to find these disconnected files or discover the relationship among these. File systems maintain a plain set of metadata items about each file which could be utilized to discover some of the hidden relationships. However, this meta-information is very sparse as most of this metadata is rarely entered by the user. Moreover, files in a file system are mostly private and cannot get the benefit of collaborative tagging. Web of Data, on the other hand also contains information related to the file system objects which could be utilized for linking with information in file systems. The purpose of introducing Linked Data technology was to solve similar issues on the web. This article investigates the exploitation of Linked Data technology in file systems and provides a comprehensive review on the possible use of Linked Data Technology in file systems.},

abstract={Recently it receives extensive concerns that mining tags from WSDL documents, since service tags are widely used for better utilization of web services. However, most WSDL documents lack contents, which lead to great limitation for service tag mining. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to retrieve and extract service tags by leveraging information from the Internet. Our approach retrieves service related web pages by searching online for the URL of the services, then executes a Vector Space Model (VSM) based procedure to fulfill structure analysis and content extraction of the pages, finally mines service related tags together with WSDL documents. Experiments on real web services demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which is able to extract more number of abundant and meaningful tags.},

abstract={The current paper focuses on the evaluation of the contribution of stereo information to feature-based pattern classification for audio semantic analysis. In radio productions, where multiple speakers' voices and music coexist, it is quite important to detect voice and music patterns, in order to achieve efficient classification of the audio content. Recent research confirmed that the process of audio feature extraction and selection is critical for the overall system performance. In the current work, the feature extraction procedure is applied in each audio channel of stereo radio programmes separately in order to exploit the differences of audio information between channels. Feature ranking algorithms are employed, aiming to investigate the saliency of the feature differences. The classification performance of the implemented artificial neural systems revealed that the stereo differences have to be taken into consideration during audio semantic analysis.},

abstract={To leverage large-scale weakly-tagged images for computer vision tasks (such as object detection and scene recognition), a novel cross-modal tag cleansing and junk image filtering algorithm is developed for cleansing the weakly-tagged images and their social tags (i.e., removing irrelevant images and finding the most relevant tags for each image) by integrating both the visual similarity contexts between the images and the semantic similarity contexts between their tags. Our algorithm can address the issues of spams, polysemes and synonyms more effectively and determine the relevance between the images and their social tags more precisely, thus it can allow us to create large amounts of training images with more reliable labels by harvesting from large-scale weakly-tagged images, which can further be used to achieve more effective classifier training for many computer vision tasks.},

year={2014},
volume={26},

pages={2548-2560},
abstract={Social tags inherent in online music services such as Last.fm provide a rich source of information on musical moods. The abundance of social tags makes this data highly beneficial for developing techniques to manage and retrieve mood information, and enables study of the relationships between music content and mood representations with data substantially larger than that available for conventional emotion research. However, no systematic assessment has been done on the accuracy of social tags and derived semantic models at capturing mood information in music. We propose a novel technique called Affective Circumplex Transformation (ACT) for representing the moods of music tracks in an interpretable and robust fashion based on semantic computing of social tags and research in emotion modeling. We validate the technique by predicting listener ratings of moods in music tracks, and compare the results to prediction with the Vector Space Model (VSM), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The results show that ACT consistently outperforms the baseline techniques, and its performance is robust against a low number of track-level mood tags. The results give validity and analytical insights for harnessing millions of music tracks and associated mood data available through social tags in application development.},

abstract={The use of tags to annotate content creates an opportunity to explore alternatives to automate the process of extracting semantics from data sources. Semantic information is needed for many complex tasks like concept extraction and information integration. In order to establish the value of user-generated annotation, this paper presents two experiments on which only user tags are used as input. At the core of semantic extraction is the identification of concepts and relationships that are present in the data. We show, through an experimental study on tagged photographs, how to extract concepts associated with photographs and their relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to extract a concept associated with a photograph with an overall precision score of 80%. Our experiments also show that a variation of the Jaccard similarity coefficient on sets of tags can be used to determine equivalence relationships between the concepts associated with these sets.},

title={An Experimental Analysis of Suggestions in Collaborative Tagging},
year={2009},
volume={1},
pages={108-115},
abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, like a web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the `rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is `compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a `compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems.},

year={2013},
pages={240-249},
abstract={The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

abstract={Tag recommendation systems are either personalized or non-personalized. Personalized tag recommendation utilizes a user's tagging behavior from her tagging history for predictions. Whereas non-personalized recommendation systems recommend what is popular and relevant to the user. In this study, we have analyzed the role of personal tagging history in recommending tags. The experiments are done on three folksonomy datasets: Delicious, Flickr and Bibsonomy. Important results for three popular tag recommendation algorithms: PITF, FolkRank and Adapted PageRank are reported in terms of prediction quality. It is found that users' history usage preferences change across all data sets; hence overall prediction quality of personalized recommendation system may suffer. We discover a generic life cycle of folksonomy users on the basis of their history usage. We propose this life cycle can be used to improve an overall prediction performance of a recommendation system across all folksonomies.},

abstract={Up to now, the problem of ensuring collaborative activities in e-Learning against dishonest students' behaviour has been mainly tackled with technological security solutions. Over the last years, technological security solutions have evolved from isolated security approaches based on specific properties, such as privacy, to holistic models based on technological security comprehensive solutions, such as public key infrastructures, biometric models and multidisciplinary approaches from different research areas. Current technological security solutions are feasible in many e-Learning scenarios but on-line assessment involves certain requirements that usually bear specific security challenges related to e-Learning design. In this context, even the most advanced and comprehensive technological security solutions cannot cope with the whole scope of e-Learning vulnerabilities. To overcome these deficiencies, our previous research aimed at incorporating information security properties and services into on-line collaborative e-Learning by a functional approach based on trustworthiness assessment and prediction. In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer on-line assessment approach carried out in a real on-line course developed in our real e-Learning context of the Open University of Catalonia. The design presented in this paper is conducted by our trustworthiness security methodology with the aim of building peer-to-peer collaborative activities, which enhances security e-Learning requirements. Eventually, peer-to-peer visualizations methods are proposed to manage security e-Learning events, as well as on-line visualization through peer-to-peer tools, intended to analyse collaborative relationship.},

abstract={Computational thinking has recently been widely recognized as a fundamental skill that should be cultivated for everyone and in every field. Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.},

abstract={We consider the problem of managing advertisements (or ads for short) for ad-hoc online videos, such as those generated by end users. We propose a novel ad selection approach based on video tags. We first compute intrinsic values of individual video tags to each ad, called ad-specific weights of tags. The computed weight of a tag indicates the relevance of the tag to a given ad. Then based on the tag weights, we select the ad which is the most relevant to the current video which a user is viewing.Using lab experiments, we show that our tag-based approach is able to select relevant ads. For example, experiments show that 58% of the selected ads are among the top 5 most relevant ads in a pool of 64 candidate ads.},

abstract={While recent progress has been made in understanding the structure and dynamics of social tagging systems, we know little about the users' underlying motivations for tagging, and how these motivations influence the resulting use of tagging systems. In this article, we propose and empirically validate a conceptual model of key factors that affect users' attitude and intention to use social tagging systems. Our findings highlight three new factors and confirm two previous factors. In addition to Perceived Enjoyment and Perceived Ease-of-use, we introduce Content Generation, Information Retrievability, and Information Re-findability as new dimensions affecting the use of social tagging systems. Our goal is to help researchers, designers, and managers of tagging systems and other social systems on the Web understand how to motivate users to increase their use and hence harvest the collaborative and sharing benefits associated with these tools.},

abstract={Social bookmarking and publication sharing systems are essential tools for web resource discovery. The performance and capabilities of search results from research paper bookmarking system are vital. Many researchers use social bookmarking for searching papers related to their topics of interest. This paper proposes a combination of similarity based indexing “tag title and abstract” and static ranking to improve search results. In this particular study, the year of the published paper and type of research paper publication are combined with similarity ranking called (HybridRank). Different weighting scores are employed. The retrieval performance of these weighted combination rankings are evaluated using mean values of NDCG. The results suggest that HybridRank and similarity rank with weight 75:25 has the highest NDCG scores. From the preliminary result of experiment, the combination ranking technique provide more relevant research paper search results. Furthermore the chosen heuristic ranking can improve the efficiency of research paper searching on social bookmarking websites.},

year={2008},
pages={589-596},
abstract={One of the goals of mobile and ubiquitous computing is to enable ad-hoc interactions between different kinds of entities to help end-users perform different kinds of tasks. These entities, which include devices and services, may either be mobile or situated in the surrounding physical environment. However, these interactions require the use of rich semantic models describing the capabilities of the entities, the data exchanged between them and the desires of end-users. These semantic models enable the discovery of entities that satisfy certain constraints as well as the composition of different entities into applications for performing different kinds of tasks. In this paper, we describe two models that we have used in our systems for describing data and entities. The first model is based on OWL ontologies, where all data is described by a set of OWL facts, and component inputs and outputs are described using RDF graph patterns. The second model is based on folksonomies, where all data is described by a set of tags, and component inputs and outputs are also described using sets of tags. The two models have very different properties in terms of expressiveness and ease of use. We present our experiences in using these models for discovery of entities and for the automatic composition of complex flows in response to dynamic end-user goals. We also describe some of the future challenges that lay in the path of semantically-enabled ad-hoc interactions.},

abstract={Information and communication technologies have been widely adopted in most of educational institutions to support e-Learning through different learning methodologies such as computer supported collaborative learning, which has become one of the most influencing learning paradigms. In this context, e-Learning stakeholders, are increasingly demanding new requirements, among them, information security is considered as a critical factor involved in on-line collaborative processes. Information security determines the accurate development of learning activities, especially when a group of students carries out on-line assessment, which conducts to grades or certificates, in these cases, IS is an essential issue that has to be considered. To date, even most advances security technological solutions have drawbacks that impede the development of overall security e-Learning frameworks. For this reason, this paper suggests enhancing technological security models with functional approaches, namely, we propose a functional security model based on trustworthiness and collective intelligence. Both of these topics are closely related to on-line collaborative learning and on-line assessment models. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to discover how security can be enhanced with trustworthiness in an on-line collaborative learning scenario through the study of the collective intelligence processes that occur on on-line assessment activities. To this end, a peer-to-peer public student's profile model, based on trustworthiness is proposed, and the main collective intelligence processes involved in the collaborative on-line assessments activities, are presented.},

year={2011},
pages={884-889},
abstract={The need to identify an approach that recommends items that match users' preferences within social networks has grown in tandem with the increasing number of items appearing within these networks. This research presents a novel technique for item recommendation within social networks that matches user and group interests over time. Users often tag items in social networks with words and phrases that reflect their preferred "vocabulary." As such, these tags provide succinct descriptions of the resource, implicitly reveal user preferences, and, as the tag vocabulary of users tends to change over time, reflect the dynamics of user preferences. Based on evaluation of user and group interests over time, we present a recommendation system employing a modified latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model in which users and tags associated with an item are represented and clustered by topics, and the topic-based representation is combined with the item's timestamp to show time-based topic distribution. By representing users via topics, the model can cluster users to reveal the group interests. Based on this model, we developed a recommendation system that reflects user as well as group interests in a dynamic manner that accounts for time, allowing it to perform in a manner superior to that of static recommendation systems in terms of precision rate.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community Web sites.},

In crowd sourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company's production cost can be greatly reduced. In 2003, Luis von Ahn and his colleagues pioneered the concept of "human computation", which utilizes human abilities to perform computation tasks that are difficult for computers to process. Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis. In this paper, we give a survey on the literature on crowd sourcing which are categorized according to their applications, algorithms, performances and datasets. This paper provides a structured view of the research on crowd sourcing to date.},

abstract={We are teaching a new generation of students, cradled in technologies, communication and abundance of information. The implications are that we need to focus the design of learning technologies to support social learning in context. Instead of designing technologies that ldquoteachrdquo the learner, the new social learning technologies will perform three main roles: 1) support the learner in finding the right content (right for the context, for the particular learner, for the specific purpose of the learner, right pedagogically); 2) support learners to connect with the right people (again right for the context, learner, purpose, educational goal etc.), and 3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. In the pursuit of such environments, new areas of sciences become relevant as a source of methods and techniques: social psychology, economic/game theory, multi-agent systems. The paper illustrates how social learning technologies can be designed using some existing and emerging technologies: ontologies vs. social tagging, exploratory search, collaborative vs. self-managed social recommendations, trust and reputation mechanisms, mechanism design and social visualization.},

However, students in academic institutions, who are categorised as digital native, are familiar in using Web 2.0 tools for their personal life but lack the primary skills to use them academically. This paper addresses the use of one of the most widely known social networking tool, Facebook as a learning tool for higher education students, with emphasis to developing countries such as Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to identify student's perception on using Facebook as a learning tool. Activity theory is adopted as a conceptual framework and analytical tool to demonstrate students' perceptions in using Facebook. Survey was distributed to evaluate on students' perceptions in using Facebook. The outcome of the survey is certainly helpful to determine the future trend of using online social networking tools as a learning tool in higher education.},

pages={87-92},
abstract={In this paper we propose a solution to generate tree-structure outline for lecture videos by analyzing their synchronized slides, by which detailed lecture overview can be automatically provided to E-learning portal users. Starting with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) result, we reconstruct the content of each slide. After that, we explore logical relations between slides, in order to make them hierarchical. And all potential redundant content will also be removed. Our evaluation shows that, based on our test dataset, the final outline achieved retains about 1/4 of the original texts from all slides and is organized well in an up-to-6-level tree structure. Furthermore, the average accuracy of all slide titles, which are undoubtedly the most important information, reaches 86%.},

title={Towards Cleaning-Up Open Data Portals: A Metadata Reconciliation Approach},
year={2016},
pages={71-78},
abstract={This paper presents an approach for metadata reconciliation, curation and linking for Open Governamental Data Portals (ODPs). ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing relations between tags.},

abstract={Users tag resources for a variety of reasons and using a variety of conventions. The tags that they provide are stored in social bookmarking services, so these services can provide a rich gateway to a wide and interesting quantity of web resources. The cognitive effort that has gone into making these tags has presumably added value to the description of the resource. In this work we utilize the quantitative value of these tags for ranking bookmarked web resources in social bookmarking services. Our proposed solution is called CoolRank, a simple and intuitive model to rank bookmarked web resources in a social bookmarking service, such as del.icio.us. CoolRank makes use of both quantitative information, based on the number of people who have bookmarked a web resource, and subjective information, based on the words people have used in their tags.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks. Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost.},

abstract={Folksonomy systems and social bookmarking tools are rapidly spreading on the Web. Their steady increase reveals a trend towards a more dynamic and interactive space, in which users can individually assign terms to online resources. Even though users find tagging easy to use and understand, they need to see, closely, users sharing same interest as them for many reasons (facilitating the information retrieval and confidentiality management, insuring privacy respect, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a new method for automatically creating a new social network, across a popular folksonomy site, where users are clustered according to their domain of interest. We semantically represent these interests by using DBPEDIA ontology as a multi-domain ontology and we propose a methodology for enriching this ontology.},

abstract={Social annotations provide additional document description contributed by online users and they have been explored for improving search performance. However, most existing methods need offline analysis of the whole tagged corpus, which is computationally expensive and cannot fit specific queries well. In this paper, we propose to use tags for document re-ranking. Specifically, we first estimate document similarity by combining words and tags and then adjust the document ranks with the assumption that similar documents should have similar retrieval scores. On similarity estimation, we present a new feature extraction method, called CRMF, from which document similarity can be derived. The CRMF can integrate the content and relation properties of multiple views and mine their correspondence. Besides, it does not require that all the documents to have tags. We tested the proposed approach on collections which are derived from Clue Web and contain Delicious tags. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of tags on document re-ranking, where CRMF is significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods using tags.},

year={2011},
pages={728-733},
abstract={Crowd sourcing has become an popular approach for annotating the large quantities of data required to train machine learning algorithms. However, obtaining labels in this manner poses two important challenges. First, naively labeling all of the data can be prohibitively expensive. Second, a significant fraction of the annotations can be incorrect due to carelessness or limited domain expertise of crowd sourced workers. Active learning provides a natural formulation to address the former issue by affordably selecting an appropriate subset of instances to label. Unfortunately, most active learning strategies are myopic and sensitive to label noise, which leads to poorly trained classifiers. We propose an active learning method that is specifically designed to be robust to such noise. We present an application of our technique in the domain of activity recognition for eldercare and validate the proposed approach using both simulated and real-world experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk.},

pages={934-940},
abstract={It is often essential for people to consult with others and ask them about their past experience and thoughts when making choices. Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social book marking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social book marking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data.},

The semantic similarity of concepts which is measured using the words hierarchy of WordNet combined with relations of concepts extracted from the Wikipedia graph is applied to link the new eLearning concepts to the domain ontology. The generated ontology as an integrated knowledge of eLearning domain can be used to model educational activities and to build, organize, and update specific learning resources.

abstract={The power law distribution of social tag frequency is one of the most important statistic characteristics in social tagging system. Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

pages={147-152},
abstract={Social tagging systems such as del.icio.us and flickr have recently increased in popularity. The easy use of tags, along with the ability to publicly share tags and resources from others, has attracted many users to actively participate. However, more and more users are facing the problem of effectively organizing and browsing the increasing tags and resources in one’s personal tag space. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically group tags in one’s personal tag space into tag clusters thus helping the user organize the large tagged resources effectively. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model one’s personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We also propose a visual interface model for tag browsing by incorporating Tag Cloud and clustering technology, where tags in each cluster are organized as a tag-cloud. Experiments on del.icio.us show that the clustering results are very similar to bundles manually created by users. The presented algorithm not only groups the semantic-related tags into clusters, but also generates meaningful descriptions for each cluster automatically. In addition, the prototype system shows that the grouped Tag Cloud visualization interface improves the visual representation of a typical Tag Cloud layout.},

abstract={Tags pose an efficient and effective way of organization of resources, but they are not always available. A technique called SCM/THD investigated in this paper extracts entities from free-text annotations, and using the Lin similarity measure over the WordNet thesaurus classifies them into a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hypernyms extracted from Wikipedia are used to map uncommon entities to Wordnet synsets. In collaborative environments, users can assign multiple annotations to the same object hence increasing the amount of information available. Assuming that the semantics of the annotations overlap, this redundancy can be exploited to generate higher quality tags. A preliminary experiment presented in the paper evaluates the consistency and quality of tags generated from multiple annotations of the same image. The results obtained on an experimental dataset comprising of 62 annotations from four annotators show that the accuracy of a simple majority vote surpasses the average accuracy obtained through assessing the annotations individually by 18%. A moderate-strength correlation has been found between the quality of generated tags and the consistency of annotations.},

abstract={This paper presents CoScribe, a concept and prototype system for the combined work with printed and digital documents, which supports a large variety of knowledge work settings. It integrates novel pen-and-paper-based interaction techniques that enable users to collaboratively annotate, link and tag both printed and digital documents. CoScribe provides for a very seamless integration of paper with the digital world, as the same digital pen and the same interactions can be used on paper and displays. As our second contribution, we present empirical results of three field studies on learning at universities. These motivated the design of CoScribe and were abstracted to a generic framework for the design of intuitive pen-and-paper user interfaces. The resulting interaction design comprising collaboration support and multiuser visualizations has been implemented and evaluated in user studies. The results indicate that CoScribe imposes only minimal overhead on traditional annotation processes and provides for a more efficient structuring and retrieval of documents.},

title={Planning-based configuration and management of distributed systems},
year={2009},
pages={65-72},
abstract={The configuration and runtime management of distributed systems is often complex due to the presence of a large number of configuration options and dependencies between interacting sub-systems. Inexperienced users usually choose default configurations because they are not aware of the possible configurations and/or their effect on the systems' operation. In doing so, they are unable to take advantage of the potentially wide range of system capabilities. Furthermore, managing inter-dependent sub-systems frequently involves performing a set of actions to get the overall system to the desired final state. In this paper, we propose a new approach for configuring and managing distributed systems based on AI planning. We use a goal-driven, tag-based user interaction paradigm to shield users from the complexities of configuring and managing systems. The key idea behind our approach is to package different configuration options and system management actions into reusable modules that can be automatically composed into workflows based on the user's goals. It also allows capturing the inter-dependencies between different configuration options, management actions and system states. We evaluate our approach in a case study involving three inter-dependent sub-systems. Our initial experiences indicate that this planning-based approach holds great promise in simplifying configuration and management tasks.},

title={Scalable tag recommendation for software information sites},
year={2017},
pages={272-282},
abstract={Software developers can search, share and learn development experience, solutions, bug fixes and open source projects in software information sites such as StackOverflow and Freecode. Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

abstract={With the coming of Web 2.0, folksonomy has emerged to help users share web-based information created by users. The basic components of folksonomy are user-inputted tags, but a major problem is that the semantics of tags are not obvious because there is no hierarchy and no relationships among the tags. To minimize these problems, this paper suggests a user-categorized tag that freely defines the category of the tag when the user inputs it. Based on the user-categorized tags, a structured folksonomy is automatically created. This paper develops a prototype as web-based document management system to describe how a structured folksonomy can be useful.},

There are some Web applications which allow users to annotate the resources besides the content; we call this phenomenon as pervasive annotation.

This paper investigates these pervasive annotation technologies and discusses their usage in the personalized services such as recommendation and presentation. We design and implement a pervasive annotation system (PAS) using service component architecture (SCA). The application of this system shows that PAS can help user manage the Web resources more conveniently and efficiently by pervasive annotation, and get required Web resource recommended through information filtering.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably, the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the “noise.” Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with three-mode tensors, in order to capture the three-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multiway analysis, latent correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Moreover, a hybrid scheme is proposed that additionally considers content-based information that is extracted from items. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Last.fm), against both recent tag-aware and traditional (non tag aware) item recommendation algorithms indicates significant improvements in recommendation quality. Moreover, the experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid scheme.},

In this paper, we study different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation techniques on their applicability and effectiveness in PLE settings. We implement 16 different tag-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, memory based as well as model based, and compare them in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. The results of the conducted offline and user evaluations reveal that the quality of user experience does not correlate with high-recommendation accuracy.},

Competition and the need for innovation imply in ever-changing and emerging needs that result in costly effort to redesign such systems. A flexible knowledge management approach should achieve personalization for organizations by adapting to the domain of the organization, meanwhile simplifying the incorporation of future knowledge retrieval needs. We describe such an approach that employs a knowledge management platform at its core, which supports adding and removing multiple folksonomies, constantly enriches them with semantics and provides domain-specific recommendations and semantic search capabilities. This approach to knowledge retrieval has been applied to the domain of homemade explosives and counter-terrorism efforts as part of the HOMER project.

pages={3629-3632},
abstract={Collaborative tagging systems (CTS) enable Internet users to annotate for resources using custom tags, and the tags reflect the user interest and thus form a user profile. However, the flexibility of tagging brings large number of synonymous and polysemous tags which make the use of these profile information to personalize resource recommendation difficult. We propose to use graph-based clustering to form groups of semantically-related tags in the offline stage. Then in the online stage the tag clusters act as an intermediary between users and resource and are utilized to personalize the query results in CTS. 5-fold cross-validation is performed on two data sets, the results are compared with two other algorithms. Results show that the algorithm proposed demonstrate much better personalization measured by the F-value, whilst the effect is more miraculous in a multi-topic than in a single-topic CTS. This observation suggests that in a multi-topic CTS tag clustering such as proposed in this paper is an important strategy.},

abstract={With the exponential increase of available information, the phenomenon of information overload has received extensive research attentions. Knowledge recommender system (KRS) is an efficient way to decrease information overload, and the user model is very critical for KRS. This paper proposes a method to establish a user model based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In detail, we first select the keywords from knowledge databases, and then represent knowledge items with Vector Space Model (VSM). Next, for a certain user, the VSM of all scanned knowledge items and related scores rated by the user are combined together to be a new matrix, named as Vector Space Model with Rating(VSMR,with dimension of m times n), where the first n-1 columns represent the VSM of the items, and the final column lists the scores given by the user. And then the GMM-based user model is trained with VSMR. Finally, the trained user model is used to predict the user's ratings on the knowledge items and the items with the higher score are considered as user's interest, which will be recommended to the user. The proposed method is validated by two experiments, which indicate that the method works well.},

To overcome this gap we propose a practical method for semantically annotating collections of XML Schemas and Web service interfaces. We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.},

pages={559-570},
abstract={Modern online social platforms allow their members to be involved in a broad range of activities including getting friends, joining groups, posting, and commenting resources. In this paper, we investigate whether a correlation emerges across the different activities a user can take part in. For our analysis, we focused on aNobii, a social platform with a world-wide user base of book readers, who post their readings, give ratings, review books, and discuss them with friends and fellow readers. aNobii presents a heterogeneous structure: 1) part social network, with user-to-user interactions; 2) part interest network, with the management of book collections; and 3) part folksonomy, with books that are tagged by the users. We analyzed a complete snapshot of aNobii and we focused on three specific activities a user can perform, namely tagging behavior, tendency to join groups and aptitude to compile a wishlist of the books one is planning to read. For each user, we create a tag-based, a group-based, and a wishlist-based profile. Experimental analysis, which was carried out with information-theory tools like entropy and mutual information, suggests that tag-based and group-based profiles are in general more informative than wishlist-based ones. Furthermore, we discover that the degree of correlation between the three profiles associated with the same user tend to be small. Hence, user profiling cannot be reduced to considering just any one type of user activity (albeit important) but it is crucial to incorporate multiple dimensions to effectively describe users' preferences and behavior.},

year={2011},
pages={352-361},
abstract={Q&A social media have gained a lot of attention during the recent years. People rely on these sites to obtain information due to a number of advantages they offer as compared to conventional sources of knowledge (e.g., asynchronous and convenient access). However, for the same question one may find highly contradicting answers, causing an ambiguity with respect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/or non-expert users. These two attributes (reliability and expertise) significantly affect the quality of the answer/information provided. We present a novel approach for estimating these user's characteristics relying on human cognitive traits. In brief, we propose each user to monitor the activity of her peers (on the basis of responses to questions asked by her) and observe their compliance with predefined cognitive models. These observations lead to local assessments that can be further fused to obtain a reliability and expertise consensus for every other user in the social network (SN). For the aggregation part we use subjective logic. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of this kind in the context of Q&A SN. Our proposed approach is highly distributed; each user can individually estimate the expertise and the reliability of her peers using her direct interactions with them and our framework. The online SN (OSN), which can be considered as a distributed database, performs continuous data aggregation for users expertise and reliability assessment in order to reach a consensus. We emulate a Q&A SN to examine various performance aspects of our algorithm (e.g., convergence time, responsiveness etc.). Our evaluations indicate that it can accurately assess the reliability and the expertise of a user with a small number of samples and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change, provided that the cognitive traits hold in practice.},

abstract={Knowledge-intensive services are prevalent in B2B environment involving complex problems and custom solutions. As such services consume and generate a large amount of information, knowledge-sharing mechanisms are required to capture, transfer and reuse information across projects. So far, with the advent of the internet, the business community has mainly focused on web-based technologies for knowledge sharing. The most common approach is a web portal through which a practitioner can access the organization's collection of intellectual capital. This approach, however, has notable drawbacks. In particular, they often fail to stimulate active user participation, in terms of both contributing to and using the knowledge base. The problem, as we see it, is largely caused by the separation between the environment of a client engagement and that of knowledge management. In this paper, we propose a knowledge management system that is integrated into the process of delivering a client engagement. The integration is realized at two levels: at the content level, the knowledge is organized by a framework that is central to the client engagement at hand; at the tool level, the knowledge management system is embedded in the software for developing work products for a client engagement The advantages of the proposed integration over existing tools are discussed.},

Which approach should be taken to assist users when searching the information they need is the point. For users, when facing the same resources, they more commonly annotate them or input search queries according to their own perspectives. This process has been already proven as a time-consuming.

title={Cross-Lingual Document Representation and Semantic Similarity Measure: A Fuzzy Set and Rough Set Based Approach},

pages={1098-1111},
abstract={As cross-lingual information retrieval is attracting increasing attention, tools that measure cross-lingual semantic similarity between documents are becoming desirable. In this paper, two aspects of cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated: One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then, Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.},

year={2007},
pages={1-6},
abstract={The massive growth of the Internet has resulted in increased difficulty in organizing and searching through the information present on it. Several strategies have been employed to tackle this problem. With the coming of Web2.0, user-created data and sharing of information among peers, community-based tagging or folksonomy has become the norm for organization of data on the Internet. The loose structure of folksonomy has led to ease in categorization of the huge amounts of information but has also given rise to some serious problems. Users tag information based on their own experiences, preferences and common sense. This leads to difficulties in search and organization of information in the long run. In this paper, we argue that since user common sense has generated both folksonomy and a corpus of machine common sense, it seems appropriate that machine common sense be used for addressing the problem of search in folksonomy. We outline an architecture for such an operation, develop a prototype as a proof of concept and describe how this approach can be extended in the future.},

Recommender system has the access to adopt tagging systems to achieve better performance. In this paper we consider that the items can be categorized into different classifications in which users show different interests. Here we adopt a two-step recommender method called TRSUC (Tagging Recommender Systems by Using Classification) which can be described as Inner-Class Recommender or Global Recommender in which we use tag as the intermediary entity between user and item. The experiment using MovieLens as dataset shows that we acquire better results than the recommender algorithms without classifying the items.},

abstract={Caching of frequently accessed data in multi-hop ad hoc environment is a technique that can improve data access performance and availability. Cooperative caching, which allows sharing and coordination of cached data among several clients, can further enhance the potential of caching techniques. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy cooperative caching scheme in mobile ad hoc networks. The cache management of the proposed caching scheme not only uses adaptively CacheData or CachePath based on data similarity and data utility, but also uses the replacement manager based on data profit. Also, the proposed caching scheme uses a prefetch manager. When the TTL of the cached data expires, the prefetch manager evaluates the popularity index of the data. If the popularity index is larger than a threshold, the data is prefetched. Otherwise, its space is released. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated analytically and is compared to that of other cooperative caching schemes.},

abstract={Tagging technique is widely used to annotate objects in Web 2.0 applications. Tags can support web service understanding, categorizing and discovering, which are important tasks in a service-oriented software system. However, most of existing web services' tags are annotated manually. Manual tagging is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tag web services automatically. Our approach consists of two tagging strategies, tag enriching and tag extraction. In the first strategy, we cluster web services using WSDL documents, and then we enrich tags for a service with the tags of other services in the same cluster. Considering our approach may not generate enough tags by tag enriching, we also extract tags from WSDL documents and related descriptions in the second step. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, a series of experiments are carried out based on web-scale web services. The experimental results show that our tagging method is effective, ensuring the number and quality of generated tags. We also show how to use tagging results to improve the performance of a web service search engine, which can prove that our work in this paper is useful and meaningful.},

year={2007},
pages={309-329},
abstract={Over almost three decades, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has produced a rich and varied literature. Although the focus of attention today is naturally on new work, older contributions that played a role in shaping the trajectory and character of the field have much to tell us. The contributors to HCI Remixed were asked to reflect on a single work at least ten years old that influenced their approach to HCI. The result is this collection of fifty-one short, engaging, and idiosyncratic essays, reflections on a range of works in a variety of forms that chart the emergence of a new field. An article, a demo, a book: any of these can solve a problem, demonstrate the usefulness of a new method, or prompt a shift in perspective. HCI Remixed offers us glimpses of how this comes about. The contributors consider such HCI classics as Sutherland's Sketchpad, Englebart's demo of NLS, and Fitts on Fitts' Law--and such forgotten gems as Pulfer's NRC Music Machine, and Galloway and Rabinowitz's Hole in Space. Others reflect on works somewhere in between classic and forgotten--Kidd's "The Marks Are on the Knowledge Worker," King Beach's "Becoming a Bartender," and others. Some contributors turn to works in neighboring disciplines--Henry Dreyfuss's book on industrial design, for example--and some range farther afield, to Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis and Jane Jacobs's The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Taken together, the essays offer an accessible, lively, and engaging introduction to HCI research that reflects the diversity of the field's beginnings.Thomas Erickson is Research Staff Member at the IBM T.

abstract={Unlimited vocabulary annotation of multimedia documents remains elusive despite progress solving the problem in the case of a small, fixed lexicon. Taking advantage of the repetitive nature of modern information and online media databases with independent annotation instances, we present an approach to automatically annotate multimedia documents that uses mining techniques to discover new annotations from similar documents and to filter existing incorrect annotations. The annotation set is not limited to words that have training data or for which models have been created. It is limited only by the words in the collective annotation vocabulary of all the database documents. A graph reinforcement method driven by a particular modality (e.g., visual) is used to determine the contribution of a similar document to the annotation target. The graph supplies possible annotations of a different modality (e.g., text) that can be mined for annotations of the target. Experiments are performed using videos crawled from YouTube. A customized precision-recall metric shows that the annotations obtained using the proposed method are superior to those originally existing for the document. These extended, filtered tags are also superior to a state-of-the-art semi-supervised technique for graph reinforcement learning on the initial user-supplied annotations.},

The proposed travel recommender system models a tourist's personal needs as a constraint satisfaction problem and helps the user build a personalized travel plan. However, because the existing constraint satisfaction method is often too rigid, this study adopts an approximate constraint satisfaction method by incorporating indifference intervals into constraints. We implement a prototype system and verify the effectiveness and usability of the system.

This paper examines the practice of retweeting as a way by which participants can be "in a conversation."

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular method in social resource sharing system. The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2. Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy.},

abstract={On Stack Overflow, more than 38,000 diverse tags are used to classify posts. The Stack Overflow community provides tag synonyms to reduce the number of tags that have the same or similar meaning. In our previous research, we used those synonym pairs to derive a number of strategies to create tag synonyms automatically. In this work, we continue this line of research and present an approach to group tag synonyms to meaningful topics. We represent our synonyms as directed, weighted graphs, and investigate several graph community detection algorithms to build meaningful groups of tags, also called tag communities. We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities. Our results show that we can cluster the Android tags to 2,481 meaningful tag communities. We also show how these tag communities can be used to derive trends of topics of Android-related questions on Stack Overflow.},

abstract={Social tagging allows users to assign keywords (tags) to resources facilitating their future access by the tag creator, and possibly by other users. In terms of its support for resource discovery, social tagging has both proponents and critics. The goal of this paper investigates if tags are an effective means for helping users locate useful resources. Adopting techniques from text categorization, we downloaded Web pages and their associated tags from del.icio.us, and trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to determine if the documents could be assigned to their associated tags. Results from the classifiers in terms of precision, recall and F1 score were mixed, suggesting that that not all tags could be used by public users for resource discovery. Detailed analyses of our results revealed characteristics of effective and ineffective tags for resource discovery. From these, implications for social tagging systems are discussed.},

title={LDA-Based Unified Topic Modeling for Similar TV User Grouping and TV Program Recommendation},
year={2015},
volume={45},

pages={1476-1490},
abstract={Social TV is a social media service via TV and social networks through which TV users exchange their experiences about TV programs that they are viewing. For social TV service, two technical aspects are envisioned: grouping of similar TV users to create social TV communities and recommending TV programs based on group and personal interests for personalizing TV. In this paper, we propose a unified topic model based on grouping of similar TV users and recommending TV programs as a social TV service. The proposed unified topic model employs two latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models. One is a topic model of TV users, and the other is a topic model of the description words for viewed TV programs. The two LDA models are then integrated via a topic proportion parameter for TV programs, which enforces the grouping of similar TV users and associated description words for watched TV programs at the same time in a unified topic modeling framework. The unified model identifies the semantic relation between TV user groups and TV program description word groups so that more meaningful TV program recommendations can be made. The unified topic model also overcomes an item ramp-up problem such that new TV programs can be reliably recommended to TV users. Furthermore, from the topic model of TV users, TV users with similar tastes can be grouped as topics, which can then be recommended as social TV communities. To verify our proposed method of unified topic-modeling-based TV user grouping and TV program recommendation for social TV services, in our experiments, we used real TV viewing history data and electronic program guide data from a seven-month period collected by a TV poll agency. The experimental results show that the proposed unified topic model yields an average 81.4% precision for 50 topics in TV program recommendation and its performance is an average of 6.5% higher than that of the topic model of TV users only. For TV user prediction with new TV programs, the average - rediction precision was 79.6%. Also, we showed the superiority of our proposed model in terms of both topic modeling performance and recommendation performance compared to two related topic models such as polylingual topic model and bilingual topic model.},

title={On using on-the-fly students' notes in video lecture indexing},
year={2017},
pages={1083-1088},
abstract={The large number of video lectures within digital archives is making critical the indexing and retrieval process. Indeed, most of the systems base the indexing process on few generic text information (e.g., course title and teacher's name) and this creates problems to students who are looking for very specific topics and hence want to browse video in details. Moreover, additional metadata could provide useful information to those users who access the educational materials by means of assistive technologies. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows students to take on-the-fly notes while watching a video lecture and uses these notes to enrich video lectures with metadata that will be helpful to the indexing and retrieval process. In particular, to allow detailed video browsing, our proposed SOcial Learning (SOLE) system defines a set of eight predefined tagnotes and segments the lecture into a sequence of video chapters. Students can use the textual notes to describe and to retrieve the video material, providing hints about its content to users with special needs. To evaluate our approach, we developed a prototype version of SOLE and we asked for volunteer evaluators. Results showed that users feel comfortable in taking notes while watching a video and liked to browse video lectures using notes. According to the results obtained in the evaluation, both students and video lecture providers might appreciate the proposed approach.},

The system uses individual ratings given by the members of community, along-side rating of the games that a particular gamer likes, in order to predict and recommend new games to that gamer. The aim is to recommend games that match the user preferences and then user-based collaborative filtering is applied on the individual ratings of the games for a particular gamer to find similarity between those gamers. Genre-based filter is smeared on the shared rated games. The prediction algorithm is also tested on a larger standard dataset, Movie Lens, in order to verify the prediction accuracy. The results of our collaborative filtering approach is also compared using Mean Absolute Error.

abstract={Nowadays, with development of Information technology, using e-learning for higher quality of education has been increased. On the other hand with the emergence of Web 2.0 and high interest for using its technologies such as tagging, annotating and social networking caused to more users participation than before. In this regard, one of the most popular technologies is Tagging. Usually users used to place tags on the contents as a reminder in future. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to assess the learners' understandings. The mentioned method which is named TagAssessment computes the figure of relationship between the contents and the user's tags and utilizes the obtained results for learner assessment. In this regard, the semantic distance between the tags associated to the content, and the concepts covered by the same content is calculated using WordNet tree ontology. In the evaluation process, ninety learners were asked to place their tags on the contents related to a BSc course to create a data set for further evaluation. The obtained results showed that as the smaller the distance between the learners' tags and the contents are the better comprehension have been achieved.},

title={Fuzzy clustering-based approach to derive hierarchical structures from folksonomies},
year={2013},
pages={1-8},
abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies.},

Experimental results evaluated on 17 subjects with a network of 5 wearable nodes with 5 everyday life activities show that the recognition models can be transferred to a new untrained node replacing a node previously present in the network without a significant loss in the recognition performance.

abstract={Social media hold abundant opportunities for service providers to interact with their clients. Whereas social media as sales channels have been studied extensively in the Marketing literature, much less is known about the ways in which public sector organisations capitalize on this potential. The purpose of this study is to explore how local governments utilize online social networks as a means for external communication. In a content analysis approach, we analyse 2,522 postings on the Facebook profiles of three out of the ten largest cities in Germany. The analysis is mainly based on a coding scheme that was derived both from literature as well as from interviews with experts, and complemented with a quantitative analysis of the Facebook profiles of the 25 largest German cities. We find that public administrations hardly make use of the opportunities these new media offer, yet.},

abstract={With the growing number of Web services available on the Web, finding services that match user's query becomes more difficult. To deal with the problem, numerous approaches employed semantic techniques in terms of annotation (or tagging) and service discovery algorithms. However, the problem of semantic service discovery based on the identification of fine-grained goals of users and services is still challenging due to the lack of semantic information in Web services. To enable the goal-driven semantic service discovery, we propose an automatic functional-goals tagging approach which employs a set of natural language processing (NLP) procedures based on the descriptions of Web services. In addition, to check the effectiveness of the functional-goals tagged, we designed a goal-driven semantic service discovery algorithm and compared it with other approaches: keyword-based, ontology-based, and topic-based service discovery. As results, our proposed goal-driven semantic service discovery achieved 75.7% of precision and 59.6% of recall (finally, F1=62%) that outperform other discovery approaches.},

In this paper we propose a recommendation algorithm, called Fas Tag, that links the relevance of the tags to both their popularity and the opinions of the user's neighbors. Fas Tag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of Fas Tag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, Fas Tag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags. The experiments we did on several datasets show a significant improvement of the accuracy of the recommendations.},

The manual screening of biomedical literature is an important task in the process of systematic reviews. Researchers and curators have the very demanding, time-consuming, and error-prone task of manually identifying documents that should be included in a systematic review concerning a specific problem. We developed a supervised learning approach to support screening tasks, by automatically flagging potentially relevant documents from a list retrieved by a literature database search. To overcome the main issues associated with the automatic literature screening task, we evaluated the use of data sampling, feature combinations, and feature selection methods, generating a total of 105 classification models. The models yielding the best results were composed of a Logistic Model Trees classifier, a fairly balanced training set, and feature combination of Bag-Of-Words and MeSH terms. According to our results, the system correctly labels the great majority of relevant documents, making it usable to support HIV systematic reviews to allow researchers to assess a greater number of documents in less time.},

Service discovery based on semantics of web services is one of the main needs in service integration and composition. The main current approaches for semantic discovery of services are the keyword-based approach and the ontology-based approach. The plain simple keyword matching strategy is time-consuming and has inefficient recall and precision. The ontology-based strategy, on the other hand, is efficient, but may not be practical for the wide public use due to the lack of domain experts. In this paper, we propose a new approach that support semantic service discovery and service backing up in case of service unavailability.

abstract={Recommender system is mainly based on collaborative filtering algorithms in social network, where it takes folksonomy as basic data structure. Collaborative filtering as a classical method of information retrieval has been also used in helping people to deal with information overload in folksonomies system. When context is taken into account, there might be difficulties when it comes to making recommendations to users who are placed in a context other than the usual one, since these main elements of folksonomy are dependent on their context informations. In this paper, a contextual collaborative filtering model is proposed, which produces recommendations based on the context, and may be better solution to folksonomies in the recommender system. In order to solve the contextual problems emerging in the process of recommendational application, this paper offers a feasible means for developers to handle context problems for folksonomy application.},

year={2010},
pages={3447-3454},
abstract={We present a system that automatically recommends tags for YouTube videos solely based on their audiovisual content. We also propose a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of video categories that exploits knowledge mined from the World-Wide Web text documents/searches. First, video content to tag association is learned by training classifiers that map audiovisual content-based features from millions of videos on YouTube.com to existing uploader-supplied tags for these videos. When a new video is uploaded, the labels provided by these classifiers are used to automatically suggest tags deemed relevant to the video. Our system has learned a vocabulary of over 20,000 tags. Secondly, we mined large volumes of Web pages and search queries to discover a set of possible text entity categories and a set of associated is-A relationships that map individual text entities to categories. Finally, we apply these is-A relationships mined from web text on the tags learned from audiovisual content of videos to automatically synthesize a reliable set of categories most relevant to videos - along with a mechanism to predict these categories for new uploads. We then present rigorous rating studies that establish that: (a) the average relevance of tags automatically recommended by our system matches the average relevance of the uploader-supplied tags at the same or better coverage and (b) the average precision@K of video categories discovered by our system is 70% with K = 5.},

abstract={This article presents a method to assess whether folksonomies are useful shared conceptualizations for conceptual modeling. A method based on the tripartite model (actors, concepts and instances) induces from social applications a folksonomy related to a domain of knowledge. The hypothesis of this paper is that if folksonomies are shared conceptualizations, then using them in conceptual modeling should reduce the number of divergences between actors when they elicit terms to be part of a model (a concept map in this article). A controlled experiment of conceptual modeling was performed with experimental groups who received tags inducted from data of categorizations from Delicious and control groups who received terms extracted from Web pages categorized on Delicious. The results show that the experimental groups obtained less divergences (on average) in elicitation of terms when compared to control groups.},

abstract={Modeling and detecting bursts in data streams is an important area of research with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we present a novel method to analyze and identify correlated burst patterns by considering multiple data streams that coevolve over time. The main technical contribution of our research is the use of a dynamic probabilistic network to model the dependency structures observed within these data streams. Such dependencies provide meaningful information concerning the overall system dynamics and should be explicitly integrated into the burst detection process. Using both synthetic scenarios and two real-world datasets, we compare our method with an existing burst-detection algorithm. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach allows for more balanced and accurate burst quantification.},

Crowdsourcing, however, is relatively novel as a methodology within virtual environment studies, in archaeology, and within the heritage domains where this research is focused. The studies that are being conducted are few and far between in comparison to other areas. This paper aims to develop a recent concept in crowdsourcing work termed `crowd behaviour mining' [2] using virtual environments, and to develop a unique concept in crowdsourcing activities that can be applied beyond the case studies presented here and to other domains that involve human behaviour as independent variables. The case studies described here use data from experiments involving separate heritage projects and conducted during two Royal Society Summer Science Exhibitions, in 2012 and 2015 respectively. `Crowd Behaviour Mining' analysis demonstrated a capacity to inform research in respect of potential patterns and trends across space and time as well as preferences between demographic user groups and the influence of experimenters during the experiments.},

abstract={Social networking sites are ingrained in the fabric of our day-to-day lives, with these sites being widely used to exchange personal information and content. Some forms of access control are provided by the sites themselves to protect the user-uploaded content. However, these types of control are limited in that they require the user's input for the effective protection, otherwise a default policy which provides minimal protection is often applied. Towards providing extended content protection, in this paper we propose an approach for automated user-uploaded content control. Automatic enforcement allows us to extend the protection of content for unprotected files, preventing underage viewers from accessing adult content, tracking stolen or misused copyright-free images. This work builds upon the notion of `Web-Traveler policies', previously introduced as a new class of content control policies. In the paper, we also provide a proof of concept implementation of our algorithms for automatic propagation for images in order to prove the applicability and strength of our approach.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of music classification when training data is distributed throughout a network of interconnected agents (e.g. computers, or mobile devices), and it is available in a sequential stream. Under the considered setting, the task is for all the nodes, after receiving any new chunk of training data, to agree on a single classifier in a decentralized fashion, without reliance on a master node. In particular, in this paper we propose a fully decentralized, sequential learning algorithm for a class of neural networks known as Random Vector Functional-Link nets. The proposed algorithm does not require the presence of a single coordinating agent, and it is formulated exclusively in term of local exchanges between neighboring nodes, thus making it useful in a wide range of realistic situations. Experimental simulations on four music classification benchmarks show that the algorithm has comparable performance with respect to a centralized solution, where a single agent collects all the local data from every node and subsequently updates the model.},

Every second, the CTL-model updates a diagnosis of the operator's cognitive state; by integrating this model in a (semi-)autonomous robot, the robot's level of automation and user interface can be attuned to the operator's state. The CTL-model's predictions were tested in an Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) setting. The test showed insufficient workload variations to validate the model. This indicates that participants should be subjected to more “high-pressure” conditions in future trials. These results also suggest that in a realistic environment, an operator's mental workload is affected by high-level coping strategies.},

This paper presents an approach to augment corpus-based ontology learning by considering terms from collaborative tagging systems, social networking platforms, and micro-blogging services. The proposed framework collects information on the domain's terminology from domain documents and a seed ontology in a triple store. Data from social sources such as Delicious, Flickr, Technorati and Twitter provide an outside view of the domain and help incorporate external knowledge into the ontology learning process.

title={The use of social tagging to support the cataloguing of learning objects},
year={2014},
pages={1-7},
abstract={Social networks have become the main media for information dissemination in the so-called Web 2.0. The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.},

title={Who ordered this?: Exploiting implicit user tag order preferences for personalized image tagging},
year={2016},
pages={1-6},
abstract={What makes a person pick certain tags over others when tagging an image? Does the order that a person presents tags for a given image follow an implicit bias that is personal? Can these biases be used to improve existing automated image tagging systems? We show that tag ordering, which has been largely overlooked by the image tagging community, is an important cue in understanding user tagging behavior and can be used to improve auto-tagging systems. Inspired by the assumption that people order their tags, we propose a new way of measuring tag preferences, and also propose a new personalized tagging objective function that explicitly considers a user's preferred tag orderings. We also provide a (partially) greedy algorithm that produces good solutions to our new objective and under certain conditions produces an optimal solution. We validate our method on a subset of Flickr images that spans 5000 users, over 5200 tags, and over 90,000 images. Our experiments show that exploiting personalized tag orders improves the average performance of state-of-art approaches both on per-image and per-user bases.},

Social Computing is a novel and emerging computing paradigm that involves a multi-disciplinary approach in analyzing and modeling social behaviors on different media and platforms to produce intelligent and interactive applications and results. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results.

Our model first extracts keywords from text through a multi-weighting framework, which includes frequency weighting, sentence weighting, speaker weighting and position weighting. Then we get their bigrams through frequent pattern matching. In order to generate more flexible and socialized tags, we expand keywords and their bigrams by exploring tag associations mined from a famous bookmarking web del.icio.us. Finally we rank the three parts of tag candidates under a uniform metric. Unlike previous models used for tag recommendation task, our model needs neither seed tags for source texts nor a complete tag set. It can recommend new tags out of the historical tag set. We evaluate our methods on 10,265 Chinese dialogues. Experimental results show our method outperform previous models like TextRank, TFIDF rank and KNN.},

abstract={Human computation is a new and evolving research area that centers around harnessing human intelligence to solve computational problems that are beyond the scope of existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. With the growth of the Web, human computation systems can now leverage the abilities of an unprecedented number of people via the Web to perform complex computation. There are various genres of human computation applications that exist today. Games with a purpose (e.g., the ESP Game) specifically target online gamers who generate useful data (e.g., image tags) while playing an enjoyable game. Crowdsourcing marketplaces (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) are human computation systems that coordinate workers to perform tasks in exchange for monetary rewards. In identity verification tasks, users perform computation in order to gain access to some online content; an example is reCAPTCHA, which leverages millions of users who solve CAPTCHAs every day to correct words in books that ptical character recognition (OCR) programs fail to recognize with certainty. This book is aimed at achieving four goals: (1) defining human computation as a research area; (2) providing a comprehensive review of existing work; (3) drawing connections to a wide variety of disciplines, including AI, Machine Learning, HCI, Mechanism/Market Design and Psychology, and capturing their unique perspectives on the core research questions in human computation; and (4) suggesting promising research directions for the future.

abstract={eGovernment in the new context of smart cities aims at improving the participation model of citizens that are no longer mere consumers of services designed and offered by public bodies. The availability of (open) data from the PA and third party organizations, which can be made public and widely accessible, introduces a significant paradigm shift from citizen-centric to citizen-driven eGovernment. In this direction, the mashup model (for client-side composition), with the ability to use widespread and relatively simple Web technologies, seems to be a viable approach for simplifying service creation. To ensure an adequate penetration of this new way of service offering, social-aware service discovery techniques assume a crucial role. In the paper, we propose a recommender that offers, in addition to the conventional search techniques, some support for context- aware implicit search of services, based on social information. The ability to leverage the data characterizing the activity of users in the network easies service selection: social relationships and the potential behavioral similarities between people, or in general among users linked by similar interests, enable the inference of further behavior details when they are not directly retrievable from static or even dynamic user profiles.},

abstract={Today, users do not only access learning resources stored in traditional repositories. They use any kind of digital resource, often generated in the context of social media platforms. When trying to improve the learning experience, it is crucial that all resources that are potentially useful are accessible; and that the resources are described in a way that allows to identify what is relevant. We suggest enriching learning resource descriptions by combining metadata generated by experts, user interactions, observation components and machine-generated metadata.

abstract={This paper explores the influences of creating social tags for academic papers by novice users over time. This study distinguishes itself from related studies by examining users' perspectives through three factors - document, social and personal factors. In the study, which was conducted in two time periods, diaries and interviews were employed to elicit the subjects' influences of tags choices. During the two time periods, subjects were asked to collect and tag academic papers. They were requested to fill in their diaries after assigning tags to the papers. Subjects were also interviewed to gain more insights. The outcome from both diaries and interviews were then triangulated, where the themes related to the factors emerged. Themes that emerged include documents usage, document attributes, social ties, opinion expression and organizing strategies. Results showed that the tags assigned by the subjects were influenced by all the factors. The influence from documents usage, document attributes and organizing strategies tended to play a more dominant role than social ties and opinion expression. Also, there did not seem to be any change in the levels of influence between the two time periods. Implications of our findings are discussed.},

abstract={Tagging recommender systems allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy. While the personalization algorithmis successful in both cases.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Recommendation systems have been investigated and implemented in many aspects. Particularly, in case of collaborative filtering system, more important issue is how to manipulate the personalized recommendation results for better user understandability and satisfaction. Collaborative filtering system predicts items of interest for users based on predictive relationship discovered between the item and others. In this paper, the categorization for grouping associative items mining, for the purpose of improving accuracy and performance in the item-based collaborative filtering, is proposed. It is possible that, if the associative item is required to be simultaneously regrouped in all other groups in which they occur, the proposed method regrouped the associative items into the relevant group. In addition, the proposed method can result in improved predictive performance under the sparse data and cold-start circumstance that starts from small items in the collaborative filtering. And this method can increase the prediction accuracy and the scalability because of removing the noise generated by ratings on items of dissimilar content or interest. The approach is empirically evaluated for comparison with k-means, average link, and robust, using the MovieLens dataset. This method was found to significantly outperform the previous method.},

abstract={Forensic analysis of the large filesystems commonly found on current computers requires an effective method for categorizing and prioritizing files in order to avoid overwhelming the investigator. A key technique for this purpose is whitelisting files, i.e., skipping the detailed analysis of files that match files in a well known reference collection of files. Effective use of this technique requires an efficient method to match files, detecting not only exact matches, but also near matches or approximate matches. This paper outlines the requirements for such matching, formalizes them as the bounded best match and approximate bounded near-match problems, and describes methods to solve these problems. In particular, the approximate bounded near-match problem is mapped to the problem of finding near neighbors in a high-dimensional metric space and solved using locality-sensitive hashing.},

abstract={Recently social tagging systems are increasingly becoming popular. These systems allow users to manage, organize and search their required resources. Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy. The experimental results on a real-world dataset, Citeulike, indicate significant improvements in recommendation quality and better performance compared with the existing systems.},

title={User Familiar Degree Aware Recommender System},
year={2015},
pages={385-391},
abstract={In a recommender system, items can be rated across multiple fields by users with varying degrees of familiarity. Hence, the ratings in a recommender system should have different recommended weights. Ratings in fields where in the user has high or low familiarity should be given high or low recommended weights, respectively. However, current recommendation algorithms ignore this problem and use the ratings indiscriminately, thus affecting the accuracy of the recommendation system. In this paper, we provide a focused study of user-familiarity degree-aware recommendation and develop a user-familiarity degree-aware latent factor model for recommendations that considers both user familiarity and item features reflected by the tagging information. We also design a user-familiarity degree-aware probability matrix factorization model, which computes the degree of familiarity of a user with the items he/she has rated. By using the user-familiarity degree, different recommended weights are given to every rating to obtain precise recommendations. The experiment results on real-world datasets show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models and effectively improves the accuracy of the recommendation results.},

title={The Collaborative Nature of Interruption Handling},

pages={1-10},
abstract={Interruptions have become an indispensible and ubiquitous part of multi-project knowledge work. While most existing studies analyze the effects of interruptions from the perspective of the interrupted individual, in this paper I propose to interpret task interruptions as events that are embedded in a rich social context. Handling interruptions therefore becomes a collective activity that depends on the interplay of a variety of actors. Interruption planning and task resumption are portrayed as collaborative processes: the paper presents six corresponding design guidelines for organizational and technological support. By the example of three prototypes, different possibilities to support knowledge workers in handling interruptions are discussed and put to the test.},

abstract={Increasingly developed social sharing websites like Flickr and Youtube allow users to create, share, annotate, and comment medias. The large-scale user-generated metadata not only facilitate users in sharing and organizing multimedia content, but provide useful information to improve media retrieval and management. Personalized search serves as one of such examples where the web search experience is improved by generating the returned list according to the modified user search intents. In this paper, we exploit the social annotations and propose a novel framework simultaneously considering the user and query relevance to learn to personalized image search. The basic premise is to embed the user preference and query-related search intent into user-specific topic spaces. Since the users' original annotation is too sparse for topic modeling, we need to enrich users' annotation pool before user-specific topic spaces construction. The proposed framework contains two components: (1) a ranking-based multicorrelation tensor factorization model is proposed to perform annotation prediction, which is considered as users' potential annotations for the images; (2) we introduce user-specific topic modeling to map the query relevance and user preference into the same user-specific topic space. For performance evaluation, two resources involved with users' social activities are employed. Experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Tag services have recently become one of the most popular Internet services on the World Wide Web. Due to the fact that a Web page can be associate with multiple tags, previous research on tag recommendation mainly focuses on improving its accuracy or efficiency through multi-label learning algorithms. However, as a Web page can also be split into multiple sections and be represented as a bag of instances, multi-instance multi-label learning framework should fit this problem better. In this paper, we improve the performance of tag suggestion by using multi-instance multi-label learning. Each Web page is divided into a bag of instances.

abstract={Web mashup is becoming an approach more and more popular for developing Web applications both for general and enterprise purposes. Mashup development is fueled by Web sites, as Programmable Web and Mashape, offering large, ever growing, catalogues of software components accessible through Web APIs. Developing Web mashup applications requires specialized knowledge about Web APIs, technologies and the way to combine them in a meaningful way. This kind of knowledge is often available but distributed among different experts. In this paper we introduce the LINKSMAN (LINKed data Supported MAshup collaboratioN) approach for expert search in enterprise mashup development. The approach is based on integrating knowledge both internal and external to enterprises. The result is then published as linked data set. We show how typical collaboration patterns among mashup developers can be formalized and implemented on this linked data set to support expert search. A prototype application is also described.},

year={2010},
pages={222-229},
abstract={The rapidly growing amount of available digital documents of various formats and the possibility to access these through internet-based technologies in distributed environments, have led to the necessity to develop solid methods to properly organize and structure documents in large digital libraries and repositories. Specifically, the extremely large size of document collections make it impossible to manually organize such documents. Additionally, most of the document sexist in an unstructured form and do not follow any schemas. Therefore, research efforts in this direction are being dedicated to automatically infer structure and schemas. This is essential in order to better organize huge collections as well as to effectively and efficiently retrieve documents in heterogeneous domains in networked system. This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art methods for inferring structure from documents and schemas in networked environments. The survey is organized around the most important application domains, namely, bio-informatics, sensor networks, social networks, P2Psystems, automation and control, transportation and privacy preserving for which we analyze the recent developments on dealing with unstructured data in such domains.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been widely adopted by social media websites to allow users to describe content with metadata tags. Tagging can greatly improve search results. We propose a cross-language social media retrieval system (CLSMR) to help users retrieve foreign-language tagged media content. We construct a Chinese to Korean CLSMR system that translates Chinese queries into Korean, retrieves content, and then translates the Korean tags in the search results back into Chinese. Our system translates NEs using a dictionary of bilingual NE pairs from Wikipedia and a pattern-based software translator which learns regular NE patterns from the web. The top-10 precision of YouTube retrieved results for our system was 0.39875. The K-C NE tag translation accuracy for the top-10 YouTube results was 77.6%, which shows that our translation method is fairly effective for named entities. A questionnaire given to users showed that automatically translated tags were considered as informative as a human-written summary. With our proposed CLSMR system, Chinese users can retrieve online Korean media files and get a basic understanding of their content with no knowledge of the Korean language.},

In our system a user can perform an ordinary keyword search and browse relevant pages but is also given the ability to broaden the search to more general topics and narrow it to more specific topics. We show that Treelicious indeed provides an intuitive framework that allows for improved and effective discovery of knowledge.},

A number of social Web sites provide tagging functionalities and also offer folksonomies within or across the sites.

To do this, we collect Really Simple Syndication data from blogosphere, find conceptual clusters using formal concept analysis, and then evaluate the significance of these clusters. The results of the empirical evaluation show that we can effectively recommend different collections of tags to an individual or a set of users.},

title={Dynamic enrichment of social users' interests},
year={2014},

abstract={In a social context, the user is more and more an active contributor for producing social information. Then, he needs a tailored information reflecting his current needs and interests in every period of time. This aims to provide a better adaptation while accessing the information space by integrating users' interests dynamic. Indeed, users' interests may change and become “outdated” through time. So, an interest judged as relevant in a period of time may fluctuate in the next period of time. Moreover, analysing the classic user behaviour to deduce his current interests is a difficult task. In fact, his behaviour isn't always reflecting his real interests. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enriching the user profile in an evolutionary environment such as a social network. The enrichment takes into account: i) the social behaviour and more precisely the tagging behaviour (that reflects user's interests) and ii) the temporal information (that reflects the dynamic evolution of users' interests). Our approach focus on the concept of temperature that reflects the importance of a resource in each period of time. This concept is used to infer common interests of users tagging the same “important” resource. The originality of our approach relies on combining information tags, users and resources in a way that guarantees a better enrichment for the social user profile. Our approach has been tested and evaluated with the Delicious social database and shows interesting precision values.},

abstract={Currently Internet usage has increased a lot due to bandwidth availaility and technology advancements. Internet is widely used for knowledge sharing, online review of products etc. Many open forums, blogs are used for this purpose. Since many users are contributing their opinions towards any query submitted by information seeker, there is a possibility of confusion. Often opinions contradict with each other creating confusion in information seeker's mind. In these cases role of Opinion Leader(s) is very prominent. Opinion Leader is a person who has knowledge in the particular field, who's opinion makes difference and who can influence other's opinions. Identification of a person who has great experiences and/or knowledge, in a particular domain, is very helpful and useful in decision making, product marketing etc. This paper presents an approach for identification of Opinion Leader(s) using modified SPEAR (Spamming Resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking) algorithm. The expertise of user is found out on different topics. Modified SPEAR algorithm effectively identifies Opinion Leader(s) by making use of additional influence measures in the form of credit score functions. It also analyses these measures and studies their effects while ranking the Opinion Leader(s) effectively.},

abstract={Edit wars are conflicts among editors of Wikipedia when editors repeatedly overwrite each other's content. Edit wars can last from a few days to several years before reaching consensus often leading to a loss of content quality. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to create an agent-based model of edit wars in order to study the influence of various factors involved in consensus formation. We model the behavior of agents using theories of group stability and reinforcement learning. We show that increasing the number of credible or trustworthy agents and agents with a neutral point of view decreases the time taken to reach consensus, whereas the duration is longest when agents with opposing views are in equal proportion. Our model can be used to study the behavior of members in online communities and to inform policies and guidelines for participation.},

abstract={With the introduction of Web 2.0, there has been an extreme increase in the popularity of social bookmarking systems and folksonomies. In this paper, our motive is to develop a recommender system that is based on user assigned tags and content present on web pages. Although the tag recommendations in social tagging systems can be very accurate and personalized, there exists an issue of risk to the privacy of user's profile, since the social tags are given by a user expose his preferences to other users in contact. To overcome this problem, we have incorporated obfuscation privacy strategies with the well-known Delicious dataset in social tagging based recommender system. We have applied the popular supervised machine-learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours classifier to the dataset that recommends relevant tags to the user. Privacy has been introduced in our tag-based recommender system by hiding some of the necessary tags, bookmarks of a user and replacing them with some random tags and bookmarks. Our experiment results indicate that the recommender system being implemented is highly efficient in terms recall and privacy measure for different values of k. The results and comparisons indicate that we have successfully employed an effective tag recommender system, which also protects the user's privacy without any significant fall in the quality of recommendation.},

year={2015},
pages={56-63},
abstract={Nowadays, developers can be involved in several software developer communities like StackOverflow and Github. Meanwhile, accounts from different communities are usually less connected. Linking these accounts, which is called identity linkage, is a prerequisite of many interesting studies such as investigating activities of one developer in two or more communities. Many researches have been performed on social networks, but very few of them can be adapted to software communities, as information of users provided in these communities has a huge difference to that in social networks. We tackle with the problem by introducing TBIL, a novel tagging-based approach to identity linkage among software communities. The essential idea of this approach is to employ skills (measured by tags), usernames and concerned topics of developers as hints, and to use a decision tree-based algorithm and another heuristic greedy matching algorithm to link user identities. We measure the effectiveness of TBIL on two well-known software communities, i.e., StackOverflow and Github. The results show that our method is feasible and practical in linking developer identities.

title={Facilitating Knowledge Exploration in Folksonomies: Expertise Ranking by Link and Semantic Structures},
year={2010},
pages={459-464},
abstract={We developed user models of knowledge exploration in a social tagging system to test the expertise rankings generated by a link-structure method and a semantic-structure method. The link-structure method assumed a referential definition of expertise, in which experts were users who tagged resources that were frequently tagged by other experts; the semantic-structure method assumed a representational definition of expertise, in which experts were users who had better knowledge of a particular domain and were better at assigning distinctive tags associated with certain domain-specific resources. Simulations results showed that the two methods of expert identification, although based on different assumptions, were in general consistent but did show significant differences. As expected, the link-structure method was better at facilitating exploration of popular “hot” topics than the semantic-structure method. However, the semantic-structure method was better at guiding users to find less popular “cold” topics than the link-structure method. Resources tagged by domain experts could contain cold topics that were associated with high quality tags, but these resources were less likely highlighted by the link-structure method. We argue that to facilitate knowledge exploration in social tagging systems, it is important to keep a good balance between helping user to follow hot topics and to discover cold topics by including expertise rankings generated by both link and semantic structures.},

year={2014},
pages={1-7},
abstract={The Internet has become a large platform where users can interact and share contents. In this context, content distribution systems (CDS) have been designed to satisfy users needs. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems have emerged as a prominent solution to speed up CDS. In this kind of distributed system, a particular interesting challenge refers to mechanisms employed to match user's interests and published contents. The efficacy of CDS depends on the expertise of publishers to properly describe contents, which comprises an important task to guarantee good quality of experience (QoE) to users. Massive attacks may harm CDS if countermeasure mechanisms are not considered to fight content pollution. The main objective of the thesis is to devise a mechanism to provide users a good QoE and reduce the effect of malicious interference. To achieve that, three main steps guided the research work presented in the thesis and summarized in this paper: (i) we proposed a novel strategy that operates conservatively to avoid wide pollution dissemination, (ii) we extended our previous solution to cope with the subjectivity regarding content descriptions, and last, (iii) we proposed a generic model to investigate massive attacks (including content pollution) and conservative approaches.},

abstract={This paper is a follow-up of a previous paper, dedicated to the description of a holistic view of the user experience (UX) model, presenting the refined user experience framework and model within the Experiential Living Labs for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The holistic model of UX was instantiated for six different use case domains appertaining to the Internet of Things (IoT) based services, namely: wellbeing, environment, logistics, energy efficiency, eBusiness and health. These six use cases demonstrate the difficulty to select the appropriate model elements and properties according to the IoT application context as well as to identify proper metrics for measuring UX. However, based on the six use cases experiments, a bottom-up (grounded) UX model applicable to any IoT use case appears to emerge from the empirical results. The experiments conducted within the use cases show the interest of the iterative nature of the Living Lab experiential design process for improving the design until it reaches the highest level of user satisfaction inducing an appropriate technology adoption rate by consumers. Finally, the refined Experiential Design process and UX model are presented with a set of conclusions.},

pages={698-703},
abstract={The lack of labeled training data is a common issue in many machine learning applications. Semi-supervised learning addresses this issue by self-labeling unlabelled examples. Transfer learning tackles it from a different way: borrow labeled examples from a different but related domain (source domain) by assigning weights to those examples based on their suitability on the new domain (target domain). However, it is quite challenging to figure out the suitability. In this paper, we propose a different way for utilizing the labeled examples from source domain. That is, we use them only for labelling the unlabelled examples in the target domain. In this self-labelling, we use the idea of Tri-training. We call our new algorithm: TriTransfer. In TriTransfer, three initial classifiers are generated from the source data and the originally labeled data in the target domain, and an unlabeled example is labeled and added to the labeled data for a classifier if other two classifiers agree on its label. After an expanded labeled data set is obtained, we re-train the classifier. We repeat this process until no more change can be made. At the end, the final classifier, which is a weighted combination of the three classifiers, is output. We conduct an extensive empirical study on 34 UCI datasets, which shows that TriTransfer performs better than the state-of-art algorithms Transfer Boost, Tritraining, and NaiveBayes.},

pages={74-81},
abstract={Assessing the quality of the clustering process is fundamental in unsupervised clustering. In literature we can find three different clustering validity techniques: external criteria, internal criteria and relative criteria. In this paper, we focus on external criteria and present an algorithm that allows the implementation of external measures to assess clustering quality when the structure of the data set is unknown. To obtain an automatic partition of a data set and to reflect how documents must be grouped according to human intuition we use internal information present in data like descriptions provide by the users as tags and the distance between documents. The results show an evident correlation between manual and automatic classes indicating it is acceptable to use an automatic partition. In addition to presenting an alternative to finding the structure of the data set using meta-data such as tags, we also wanted to test the impact of their integration in the k-means++ algorithm and verify how it influences the quality of the formed clusters, suggesting a model of integration based on the occurrence of tags in document content. The experimental results indicate a positive impact when external measures are calculated, although there was no apparent correlation between the weight assigned to the tags and the quality of the obtained clusters.},

title={Tag recommendation in software information sites},
year={2013},
pages={287-296},
abstract={Nowadays, software engineers use a variety of online media to search and become informed of new and interesting technologies, and to learn from and help one another. We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively. Moreover, averaging over StackOverflow and Freecode results, we improve TagRec proposed by Al-Kofahi et al. by 22.65% and 14.95%, and the tag recommendation method proposed by Zangerle et al. by 18.5% and 7.35% for recall@5 and recall@10 scores.},

abstract={Web 2.0 tools and environments have made tagging, the act of assigning keywords to on-line objects, a popular way to annotate shared resources. The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

abstract={Tagging refers to the metadata that many users added in the form of keywords on photos, videos, and other resources for sharing the contents via the internet. However, there are several difficulties with tagging that come from tag variation, tag ambiguity and flat organization. This paper presents the integration of social tagging and the collaborative web search to improve users' or groups of users' satisfaction in search results. The characteristics of collaborative web search enable remote collaboration among small groups of users who are working either synchronously or asynchronously on web search tasks. Our main purpose is to analyze the users' behavior patterns from the search keywords obtained from the same and different groups of users. The patterns of web search behaviors are learned and used for generating the tag-based association rules. The results of analysis can be used to improve the quality of web search for a social search community. We designed and implemented a web application for effective use of tags to improve users' experience on web search. The users are asked to assign weights to the web links based on the relevancy of the web content to the tag. These weights are used to re-rank the original search results so that tags that best serving a user's needs are at the top of the ranked list. When a new user performs a web search, the system will generate a personalized tagging recommendation to the user for selection.},

Moreover, because of the lack of a mechanism to assist teachers in monitoring the running activities and student progress, such that constructive suggestions can be given to the students and tutoring strategies can be improved accordingly. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for calculating semantically meaningful prior knowledge and generating spreading energy for discovering student's reading status in semantic networks using a modified version of Semantic Analysis and Social Network techniques.

abstract={With the proliferation of Web 2.0 applications, user-supplied social tags are commonly available in social media as a means to bridge the semantic gap. On the other hand, the explosive expansion of social web makes an overwhelming number of web videos available, among which there exists a large number of near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective. A novel classifier-free video annotation framework is proposed by first retrieving visual duplicates and then suggesting representative tags. The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},

abstract={Cold-start scenarios in recommender systems are situations in which no prior events, like ratings or clicks, are known for certain users or items. To compute predictions in such cases, additional information about users (user attributes, e.g. gender, age, geographical location, occupation) and items (item attributes, e.g. genres, product categories, keywords) must be used. We describe a method that maps such entity (e.g. user or item) attributes to the latent features of a matrix (or higher-dimensional) factorization model. With such mappings, the factors of a MF model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy. We use the mapping concept to construct an attribute-aware matrix factorization model for item recommendation from implicit, positive-only feedback. Experiments on the new-item problem show that this approach provides good predictive accuracy, while the prediction time only grows by a constant factor.},

abstract={Several approaches to educational web-based content enrichment have been devised. Annotations in form of comments and other types of remarks obviously supply these approaches. Annotations allow enriching the educational materials mainly by retaining key information or comments; they can support visual search and also collaboration. In this paper we present a method for an acquisition of new educational content created by learners. It is based on collaborative questions creation. We let the students to enrich educational materials with questions related to the selected text. We believe that this helps them to learn more effectively. It facilitates a collaboration and explicit rating to gain new quality content. This kind of annotations can be considered also as a source of semantics of the selected text and used for adaptation. To evaluate proposed method we experimented in domain of learning programming. We implemented the method within an existing web-based educational framework ALEF and provided several experiments.},

title={A Cross-Modal Approach for Extracting Semantic Relationships Between Concepts Using Tagged Images},
year={2014},
volume={16},
number={4},
pages={1059-1074},
abstract={This paper presents a cross-modal approach for extracting semantic relationships between concepts using tagged images. In the proposed method, we first project both text and visual features of the tagged images to a latent space using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Then, under the probabilistic interpretation of CCA, we calculate a representative distribution of the latent variables for each concept. Based on the representative distributions of the concepts, we derive two types of measures: the semantic relatedness between the concepts and the abstraction level of each concept. Because these measures are derived from a cross-modal scheme that enables the collaborative use of both text and visual features, the semantic relationships can successfully reflect semantic and visual contexts. Experiments conducted on tagged images collected from Flickr show that our measures are more coherent to human cognition than the conventional measures that use either text or visual features, or the WordNet-based measures. In particular, a new measure of semantic relatedness, which satisfies the triangle inequality, obtains the best results among different distance measures in our framework. The applicability of our measures to multimedia-related tasks such as concept clustering, image annotation and tag recommendation is also shown in the experiments.},

pages={206-213},
abstract={One of the main obstacles for wider adoption of semantic rich e-learning systems is the difficulty in creating and maintaining domain ontologies describing courses. Annotations, such as those resulting from collaborative tagging, provide a new source of information which can be used to ease the process of author-ing and updating domain ontologies. This paper presents an extension to the LOCO-Analyst tool, which leverages student folksonomies to support instructors when revising and updating course domain ontologies. The support is based on a computation of relatedness between ontology concepts and students tags which takes into account the "context" defined by the domain ontology. The computed scores are visualized in a tag cloud along with tag popularity scores, to allow instructors to easily comprehend the emergent feedback of their students. This approach allows for a simple and intuitive method for instructors to associate tags with concepts in their domain ontology.},

abstract={Flickr is a widely-known Web 2.0 photo sharing system that allows users to describe their own photos with tags (aka. folksonomies) for indexing purposes. However, its tag-based photo retrieval function is severely hampered by the inherent nature of folksonomies. As the first step moving towards the alleviation of the problem, this paper, therefore, investigates characterizations of folksonomies on Flickr through its all-time most popular tags. In particular, the study focuses on tag clusters, related tags, and tag categorizations of the all-time most popular tags and compares them with concepts formally defined in ontologies from the Semantic Web. The experimental results imply the feasibilit of employing the Semantic Web technology in searching Flickr photos.},

abstract={Scientific research becomes increasingly reliant on collaborative effort among multiple institutions and interdisciplinary consortia, through sharing scientific experiments and data and collaboration on analysis of data and results. Besides information sharing, there is a growing need to create a framework to enable collaborative, cross-disciplinary research, which can facilitate a research community into a default mode of collaboration, including: i) enabling scientific researchers to dynamically interact with others, collaboratively author, annotate, review, comment on others' data, and discuss their research; ii) providing a dynamic collaboration environment by harnessing collective contributions from a group of researchers; and iii) facilitating broader participation of people into research projects. While traditional data management and integration systems put much focus on passively integrating existing data, the collaboration among data providers and users is quite limited. In this paper, we present a Web-based collaborative platform to dynamically integrate information for scientific research. Besides data integration, the system provides essential collaboration capabilities to boost user participation and collaboration. The system will not only enable users as active information contributors to bring significant new values to the data, but also provide an environment for scientific researchers to do collaborative research in a large research community.},

abstract={Diversifying the query results is an effective approach to obtain an user's underlying query information. Tag as an important recommendation information has drawn more and more attentions, which is also extensively exploited in SN(Social Network). The results generated by the current algorithms often ignore diversity in the recommended results, which seriously affecting the user's experience. In this paper, we address the problem of diversified coverage based tag recommendation. To our best knowledge, it is first proposed in the context of tag recommendation. Since the NP-hardness of the problem, a greedy based diversified coverage tag recommendation algorithm, namely GDC, is proposed. First, it constructs a semantic similarity graph based on the local and global tag co-occurrence matrices, which improves the recommendation accuracy by incorporating both the user's interests and the popularity of tags. Further, GDC recursively searches the MIDS (Minimum Independent Dominating Set) in an efficient manner together with an effective pruning rule. The experiments conducted on the real datasets of MovieLens and Last.fm show that the proposed GDC improve the diversity significantly.},

abstract={Detecting similar applications is a challenging problem, since it implies that similar high-level features and their low-level implementations can be detected and matched automatically. We propose an approach for automatically detecting Closely reLated applications in ANdroid (CLANdroid) by relying on advanced Information Retrieval techniques and five semantic anchors: identifiers, Android APIs, intents, permissions, and sensors. To evaluate CLANdroid we created a benchmark consisting of 14,450 apps along with information on similar apps provided by Google Play. We also compared effectiveness of different semantic anchors for detecting similar apps as perceived by 27 users. The results show that using Android-specific semantic anchors are useful for detecting similar Android apps across different categories. We also measured the impact of third-party libraries and obfuscated code when identifying similar Android apps, and our results suggest that there is significant difference in the accuracy when third-party libraries are excluded.},

abstract={The question of whether intelligence can be attributed to groups or not has been raised in many scientific disciplines. In the field of computer-supported collaborative learning, this question has been examined to understand how computer-mediated environments can augment human cognition and learning on a group level. The era of social computing which represents the emergence of Web 2.0 collaborative technologies and social media has stimulated a wide discussion about collective intelligence and the global brain. This paper reviews the theory of distributed cognition in the light of these concepts in an attempt to analyze and understand the emergence process of intelligence that takes place in the context of computer-mediated collaborative and social media environments. It concludes by showing that the cognitive organization, which occurs within social interactions serves as a catalyst for intelligence to emerge on a group level. Also a process model has been developed to show the process of collaborative knowledge construction in Wikipedia that characterizes such cognitive organization.},

abstract={One of the cornerstones of the Social Web is informal user-generated metadata (or tags) for annotating web objects like pages, images, and videos. However, many real-world domains are currently left out of the social tagging phenomenon due to the lack of a wide-scale tagging-savvy audience - domains like the personal desktop, enterprise intranets, and digital libraries. Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement.},

abstract={Nowadays, many online communities provide means for users to contribute in the evaluation of community created media by tagging, commenting and rating. Judging the users expertise in such collaborative systems is an important issue. As these systems are becoming increasingly popular, they are attackable, e.g. by Sybil Attacks. Thus, an effective expert ranking strategy must be robust to such attacks. In this paper, we propose MHITS, an algorithm to rank users' expertise by exploiting the number of users' fair ratings and direct trust users gain in the online community. We integrate SumUp, a Sybil-resilient algorithm, into MHITS algorithm as a robust ranking strategy. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can ensure that the highly ranked experts are highly trusted users and provide the high number of fair ratings for the relevant media. We contribute to the experimental evaluation of algorithms for online systems, fighting malicious behavior.},

In order to address this concern, human-centered business rule engines are proposed, which integrate data mining support and provide intelligent user interfaces to collaborating users. An underlying ontology is used to specify the vocabulary for the business rules dependent on the business information system. We apply a mapping approach to map the concepts and relationships of the underlying ontology to user-oriented semantic types.

abstract={The wide diffusion of community tagging sites and related folksonomies has made the knowledge discovery and retrieval still much more urgent topic. If tagging systems allow users to add freely keywords to web resources, clicking on a tag has the side effect of a tag-based query, since enables the users to explore related content. The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes. Primary is the role of agents which assist users in the tagging activities as well as the retrieval of resources related to their interest. A user-friendly interface proposes an integrated one-shot view for interacting with a tagging system.},

Book marking is especially important for content not located by the top ranked web pages or easily explored with a traditional search engine. This study investigated the effects that the major context of use (work vs. non-work) has had on experiences with the social book marking service. A within-subject experiment was conducted with 77 subjects. Each took part in both work and non-work information tasks by interacting with six navigation aids. The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues. Understanding how users interact with various way finding cues can enlighten design considerations for refining social navigation functions. For social book marking service providers, the findings of this study offer new insights into user-centered design from an information interaction perspective.},

abstract={Social bookmarking tools are rapidly emerging on the Web as it can be witnessed by the overwhelming number of participants. In such spaces, users annotate resources by means of any keyword or tag that they find relevant, giving raise to lightweight conceptual structures aka folksonomies. In this respect, needless to mention that ontologies can be of benefit for enhancing information retrieval metrics. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ontology learning from a folksonomy, which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations between tags. The main thrust of the introduced approach stands in putting the focus on the discovery of nontaxonomic relationships. The latter are often neglected, even though they are of paramount importance from a semantic point of view. The discovery process heavily relies on triadic concepts to discover and select related tags and to extract and label non-taxonomically relationships between related tags and external sources for tags filtering and non-taxonomic relationships extraction. In addition, we also discuss a new approach to evaluate obtained relations in an automatic way against WordNet repository and presents promising results for a real world folksonomy.},

However, most instructors still typically use social media in the classroom primarily as a platform for developing or sharing information. Taking social media instruction a cautious half-step step further, we report on the use of aggregation techniques in courses of study at both Ryerson and Royal Roads Universities, in support of social media listening to solve the problems of identifying buzz about an issue and discovering trends. By aggregation, we mean identifying, collecting, and curating the top performing syndicated sources in a discourse domain. Buzz, or urgent conversation about a topic or issue, once identified, can be used by communicators to raise the performance of their own social media messaging. Trends, once discovered, can be used to inform the decision-making processes of marketers, planners, or communicators. We also discuss the reports and infographics that participants in our courses of study produce to report their findings across organizational boundaries.},

This tool allows students to collaboratively tag classroom lecture/discussion in real time through synchronized transcription and audio recording. TNT provides a visualization that highlights the important classroom points and we argue facilitates better recall and a deeper understanding of the classroom material. Through our evaluation we were able to prove that all students can benefit from this tool. We also present a case study of one student with ADD and how they benefited. The tool makes the learning experience, particularly for students with special needs like LD and ADD, less stressful while still being active in the note-taking.},

These restrictions make current approaches fail when such information is not available. We propose a novel approach, which overcomes these limitations by using semantic information recovered from byte code and an unsupervised algorithm to assign categories to software systems.

abstract={An emerging technology called Near Field Communication (NFC) is used to enable touch between mobile devices. Near Field Communication (NFC) has become an interesting field in communication industry. It helps users to intuitively establish communication between local devices. Accessing devices such as public terminals raises several security concerns in terms of confidentiality and trust. To overcome several issue, NFC can be used to leverage the trusted-computing protocol of remote attestation. NFC is one of the latest wireless communication technologies, making possible variety of business opportunities. The current paper presents a generalized approach for NFC application development, analyzes several aspects towards development including the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), as well as service providers can make their own application. In recent years instant messaging tools have been successfully introduced to support communication and collaboration processes in work environments. Research suggests that the use of instant messaging tools leads to an increased feeling of connectedness, social presence and awareness within a collaborative group.},

title={Social View Based User Modeling for Recommendation in Tagging Systems by Association Rules},
year={2010},
pages={1-5},
abstract={Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube, del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success. State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed.},

While many aspects of the technology involved, like automatic recording techniques or innovative interfaces for replay, have evolved at a rapid pace, Web lecturing has been independent of other important developments such as Web 2.0.Web 2.0 is an emerging trend that among other things aims at integrating user generated data from different systems in order to enhance the user experience.

It also introduces a prototypical interface for the virtPresenter lecture viewer that enriches Web lectures by Web 2.0 features, such as a specialized player that can be integrated in blog or wiki sites and multi-medial links that can be used to reference arbitrary passages of a Web lecture from an external blog, wiki or forum.},

abstract={Social networking applications have become a very popular means of communication and interaction in recent times and user participation has increased tremendously. It has become a norm that personal information is constantly shared with other social network users. The types of data uploaded and shared on user profiles also include sensitive information that one would rather it was accessible to a select few. The issues of security and privacy although very important seem to be a secondary consideration in the development and extensive usage of social networks. This paper highlights the potential attacks owing to the vast amount of user personal information available on social networks. The paper is concluded with proposing a theoretical model aimed at resolving the problems associated with the current default privacy and wider accessibility design implemented by most social networks.},

abstract={A scheme for identifying the semantic layers of music-related tags is presented. Arguments are provided why the applications of the tags cannot be effectively pursued without a reasonable understanding of their semantic qualities. The identification scheme consists of a set of filters. The first is related with social consensus, user-count ratio, and n-gram properties of tags. The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out with an independent, smaller hand-annotated dataset, in which high agreement between the identification provided by the scheme and annotations was found.},

We explored three sources of information to generate recommendations: users' preference about items (i.e. talks), users' social network and content of items. In order to find out what is the best recommendation approach, we explored a diverse set of algorithms from non-personalized community vote-based recommendations and collaborative filtering recommendations to hybrid recommendations such as social network-based recommendation boosted by content information of items. We found that social network-based recommendations fused with content information and non-personalized community vote-based recommendations performed the best. Moreover, for cold-start users who have insufficient number of items to express their preferences, the recommendations based on their social connections generated significantly better predictions than other approaches.},

abstract={This article investigates the effectiveness of community generated tags as social descriptors of resources uncoordinatedly annotated by community members. Our goal is to demonstrate practically that the aggregated tags applied to resources by the entire community define reasonably well resource meaning. This would allow using them for calculating semantic distance between resources. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed a large amount of data downloaded from del.icio.us. To this end, we developed an algorithm for searching 'similar' URLs based on the similarity of their aggregated tag vectors, which allowed us to identify clusters of similar resources. Our experimental findings demonstrate that massive tagging of resources leads to resource meanings that are defined bottom-up, and they prove the effectiveness of collaborative tagging systems for describing resources.},

We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features from large tag corpora as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events.

abstract={Developers frequently add annotations to source code to help them remember pertinent information and mark locations of interest for future investigation. Finding and refinding these notes is a form of navigation that is integral to software maintenance. Although there is some tool support in modern development environments for authoring and navigating these comments, we have observed that these annotations often fail to remind and are sometimes difficult to find by the programmer. To address these shortcomings, we have designed a new approach for software navigation called tags for software engineering activities (TagSEA). TagSEA combines the notion of waypointing (a mechanism for marking locations in spatial navigation) with social tagging to support programmers in defining semantically rich annotations to source code comments. The tool provides support for creating, editing, navigating, and managing these annotations. We present the results from two empirical studies, where we observed and then analyzed how professional programmers used source code annotations to support their development activities over 24 months. Our findings indicate that the addition of semantic information to annotations can improve their value. We also provide suggestions on how annotation tools in general may be improved.},

year={2013},

pages={673-688},
abstract={In this paper, a novel Tensor Factorization and tag Clustering (TFC) model is presented for item recommendation in social tagging systems. The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf ·idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.},

abstract={The problem of user's interest to item matching is at the core of recommendation systems and search engines. This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36% using the proposed algorithm.},

As a result, increasing number of web services has been developed.

Automatic clustering of web services groups together web services with similar functions. Clustering could greatly boost the power of web service search engines and generate tags to improve the search accuracy of tag-based service recommendation.

abstract={Collaborative (or social tagging) options are being added to many database catalogs on the assumption that not only those who assign tags but also those who use the catalog find such tags beneficial. But no quantitative analyses of collaborative tags exist to support this assumption. Based on questionnaires mixing collaborative tag clouds from http://www.LibraryThing.com and controlled library of congress subject heading (LCSH) strings from the library of congress catalog http://catalog.loc.gov, it was found that controlled vocabulary terms are selected above collaborative terms; that the string format is preferred to the cloud; that strings appear to ldquoperformrdquo better in terms of reflecting book content; and that it is important to users that recall is high (where uncontrolled vocabulary retrieval is generally low). Results were found to be dependent upon particulars of tag cloud or string. The outcome indicates that catalog users would derive fewer information retrieval benefits from the current form of collaborative clouds than from the staid strings of the Library of Congress Subject Headings.},

abstract={Social tagging systems allow collaborative users to annotate shared resources with tags. Since they rely on user contributed content, social tagging systems are vulnerable to spam annotations, which are generated by malicious users to mislead or confuse legitimate users. Thus, mechanisms for spam detection need to be developed to combat the flexible strategies of spammers for the success of social tagging systems. Since annotations are lack of relevant feature, the classical method of training classifier to detect spam is hard to implement. However, with their collaborative nature, knowledge on the tagging scheme do exists in the way numerous participants annotating resources with tags. In this paper, we propose a simple but remarkably effective approach for detecting tag spam in social tagging systems with collaborative knowledge. We harness the wisdom of crowds to discover the knowledge on what should be high quality annotations for resources. This knowledge is then used to tell spam posts from the legitimate ones. A distinct feature of our approach is that, it can be easily extended for user level spam detection and can do well in both levels. The proposed approach is evaluated on data set collected from real-world system. Experimental results show a convincing performance of proposed approach.},

Personalized Image search differs from general Image Search, which returns identical search results to all users for identical queries, regardless of varied user interests and information needs. In this paper we exploit the Social annotations and Novel Framework for considering the user query relevance and user specific-topic to learn personalized image search. The proposed framework contains two techniques: 1) Utility and Prediction model for social annotations. 2) We introduce a Hit Matrix technique for user query relevance and preference into the specific topic space. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed method outperforms the existing method and also shows that the developed model demonstrates the effectives of the Personalized Image Search},

abstract={Inter-social networks operations and functionalities are required in several scenarios (data integration, data enrichment, information retrieval, etc.). To achieve this, matching user profiles is required. Current methods are so restrictive and do not consider all the related problems. Particularly, they assume that two profiles describe the same physical person only if the values of their Inverse Functional Property or IFP (e.g. the email address, homepage, etc.) are the same. However, the observed trend in social networks is not fully compatible with this assumption since users tend to create more than one social network account (for personal use, for work, etc.) while using same or different email addresses. In this work, we address the problem of matching user profiles in its globality by providing a suitable matching framework able to consider all the profile's attributes. Our framework allows users to give more importance to some attributes and assign each attribute a different similarity measure. The set of experiments conducted with our default/recommended attribute/similarity measures shows the superiority of our proposal in comparison with current ones.},

year={2016},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Detecting communities in graphs is a fundamental tool to understand the structure of Web-based systems and predict their evolution. Many community detection algorithms are designed to process undirected graphs (i.e., graphs with bidirectional edges) but many graphs on the Web - e.g. microblogging Web sites, trust networks or the Web graph itself - are often directed. Few community detection algorithms deal with directed graphs but we lack their experimental comparison. In this paper we evaluated some community detection algorithms across accuracy and scalability. A first group of algorithms (Label Propagation and Infomap) are explicitly designed to manage directed graphs while a second group (e.g., WalkTrap) simply ignores edge directionality; finally, a third group of algorithms (e.g., Eigenvector) maps input graphs onto undirected ones and extracts communities from the symmetrized version of the input graph. We ran our tests on both artificial and real graphs and, on artificial graphs, WalkTrap achieved the highest accuracy, closely followed by other algorithms; Label Propagation has outstanding performance in scalability on both artificial and real graphs. The Infomap algorithm showcased the best trade-off between accuracy and computational performance and, therefore, it has to be considered as a promising tool for Web Data Analytics purposes.},

This paper first discussed the potential efficacy and emerging practices of such technologies in the domain of knowledge management. Then a quality model of online social information systems was derived from prior literature on online information service quality and analyses of characteristics of emerging technologies. An online questionnaire was developed and administrated to 168 users. Four quality dimensions that are perceived as important by users were identified by factor analysis and proved to be reliable: system usability, content quality, content exchangeability and accessibility, and sociability. The findings of this research provide implications for developers of both enterprise knowledge management systems and public social Websites, and can facilitate future development of the instrument measuring the quality of online social service from other perspectives.},

abstract={Search functionality and technology is a growing area of research. However, simple search approaches are still frequently used. A simple keyword or thesauri-based search is efficient and can be easily scaled. However, keyword-based search cannot be used to infer what may or may not be relevant to the user and thesauri, or any other expert generated model, is expensive to produce and tends to be of limited applicability. Semantic Component Selection (SemaCS) approach is not tied to any specific domain and does not rely on expert input. SemaCS is based on actual data and statistical semantic distances between words. Information on semantic distances is used for searching and for automated generation of domain model taxonomy. This paper presents SemaCS's means of acquiring these semantic distances - mNGD (2) - and its initial evaluation.},

title={Healthcare information behavior: Implicit collaboration with social tagging systems},
year={2011},
pages={639-639},
abstract={Healthcare consumers in the United States are increasingly turning to the Internet for health information and advice. A majority of Internet users in the United States use the Web to find healthcare information for themselves or others. They are collaborating with other consumers in ways that were impossible before the advent of broadband connections, social media websites, and Web2.0 technologies. Some collaboration is explicit, like the posting of health topics on question answering sites like Yahoo! Answers, or joining a health maintenance discussion board. Other collaborative behaviors are less obvious and may be considered an implicit part of a healthcare consumer's Web activities. One such implicit collaboration is the use of the website Delicious.com to bookmark and tag Web-based healthcare information resources for organization and future retrieval. Tags assigned by an individual are visible to other users, resulting in a peer-created knowledge organization system of information resources. Tags can be created by the user solely for their own use, yet the community benefits from the aggregation of individual efforts. We explore the implicit collaboration through an examination of user contributed tags for consumer health resources on the social tagging website Delicious.com. This work investigates the characteristics of tags for healthcare resources on the web. Tags were collected using two methods. First, we gathered the top 100 published search terms for the consumer health website MedlinePlus, and used these terms to retrieve search results using the Yahoo! BOSS API. We then collected the most frequent Delicious.com tags for the first URL in each search. Second, human users were asked to perform fictional healthcare searches while evaluating a prototype search engine. Returned with search results were Delicious tags we collected and stored for use in guided search and other healthcare information retrieval systems. Evaluation of tags includes user intervi- - ews and comparisons to existing professional medical vocabularies and emerging resources like the Open Access Consumer Health Vocabulary [3]. In the Web2.0 model, peers have emerged as "guides" to health information, minimizing the role of established gatekeepers [4]. Finding credible, high-quality, and comprehensive health information is a continued challenge. Web users also struggle with health literacy and vocabulary gap between clinicians and laypersons. This work may lead to enhanced methods of developing consumer health vocabularies, Web search and browsing guides, and other tools for healthcare information seekers.},

pages={99-105},
abstract={User profiling is a technique aimed at capturing and exploiting significant characteristics of the users towards the provision of personalized services within adaptive systems such as Recommender Systems (RS). In the context of Technology enhanced Learning (TeL), from a teachers' perspective, the unique ICT competence characteristics of individuals have not been considered when providing Learning Object (LO) recommendations, despite their vital contribution to the level of ICT uptake of teachers. Moreover, there is a lack of mechanisms for automatically eliciting and updating such personal characteristics within Learning Object Repositories (LOR) in order to exploit them for enhanced LO recommendations. Towards tackling this issue, this paper proposes a teacher ICT Competence elicitation mechanism utilizing fuzzy logic for inferring teachers' ICT Competences based on their usage patterns within LOR and presents the results of its preliminary accuracy evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides high accuracy and can, therefore, construct reliable depictions of the teachers' ICT Competence Profiles.},

year={2016},
volume={1},
pages={63-72},
abstract={GitHub is a well-known software community where a large number of software repositories are hosted. Since large amounts of documents and code in GitHub repositories are in a mess, users cannot search or understand them efficiently. One solution is to employ a tag system, which annotates each repository with several tags. Thus, the GitHub repositories can be more efficiently accessed and understood. However, GitHub does not provide any automated tools of tagging repositories. In order to tackle this problem, we propose GRETA, a novel graph-based approach to assigning tags for repositories on GitHub. The core insight of GRETA is (1) to construct an Entity-Tag Graph (ETG) for GitHub using the domain knowledge from StackOverflow, and (2) to assign tags for repositories by taking a random walk algorithm. We have implemented GRETA and also developed a repository search engine for GitHub using the tag assignment results of GRETA. We have evaluated GRETA against several baseline methods to investigate its effectiveness of tagging GitHub repositories. The results show GRETA achieves up to 35% of F-Measure, outperforming the baseline methods. Besides, the GRETA-based search engine gains a higher NDCG value than the search engine provided by GitHub, indicating that it significantly enhances the search ability on GitHub with the tagged repositories.},

Given a document, the described algorithm finds similar documents that may be of interest to the user. It exploits the metadata typical for the participatory web. In the adopted model, documents are viewed as objects associated with a set of tags and a set of users who have tagged them, inducing tag-based and user-based similarity. The similarity between two documents is computed as a combination of their tag-base and, user-based cosine similarity and the document recency. We have con-ducted a series of experiments using a CiteULike dump to investigate the properties of the proposed similarity measure. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm exploiting meta-information about the documents provides a good approximation of our understanding of the contextual dependency of the notion of similarity.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have emerged in recent years to become popular tools for organising information on the Web. While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system. In this paper we describe our proposal and some results of our preliminary experiments. We also discuss the significance of the work and how it can be evaluated.},

abstract={Tagging is one of the most popular services in Web 2.0 and folksonomy is a representation of collaborative tagging. Tag cloud has been the one and only visualization of the folksonomy. The tag cloud, however, provides no information about the relations between tags. In this paper, targeting del.icio.us tag data, we propose a technique, FolksoViz, for automatically deriving semantic relations between tags and for visualizing the tags and their relations. In order to find the equivalence, subsumption, and similarity relations, we apply various rules and models based on the Wikipedia corpus. The derived relations are visualized effectively. The experiment shows that the FolksoViz manages to find the correct semantic relations with high accuracy.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular way to organize content. But sometimes it is also used as a way to express opinions, which is normally done through rating- or text review systems. This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags.},

The social dynamics of individuals connected through the Internet is relevant to issues of productivity, viral marketing and the sorting out of useful ideas from the general chatter of a community. This talk will first describe a mechanism for automatically identifying communities of practice from email traffic within organizations as well as patterns in document access. Equally important is how information spreads within communities. This information has recently acquired a new dimension through the phenomenon of collaborative tagging, whereby many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content such as bookmarks, photographs and blogs. There are interesting patterns that emerge within these "folksonomies" specifically; we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given url. A dynamical model of collaborative tagging predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge.},

abstract={Tagging environments have become an interesting topic of research lately, focused mainly on clustering approaches, in order to extract emergent patterns that are derived from tag similarity and involve tag relations or user interconnections. Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

However, free form tags have characteristics that require special treatment when used for searching or recommendation because they show much more variation than controlled keywords.

We introduce second order co-occurrence and a related distance measure measure for tag similarities that is robust against the variation in tags. From this distance measure it is straightforward to derive methods to analyze user interest and compute recommendations.

abstract={In recent years, with the explosive growth of mobile smart phonesnes, the number of Android applications (apps) increases rapidly. Attackers usually leverage the popumobile smart phoneslarity of Android apps by inserting malwares, modifying the original apps, repackaging and releasing them for their own illegal purposes. To avoid repackaged apps from being detected, they usually use sorts of obfuscation and encryption tools. As a result, it's important to detect which apps are repackaged. People often intuitively judge whether two apps are a repackaged pair by executing them and observing their runtime user interface (UI) traces. Hence, we propose layout group graph (LGG) built from UI trances to model those UI behaviors and use LGG as the birthmark of Android apps for identification. Based on LGG, we also implement a dynamic repackaging detection tool, RepDroid. Since our method does not require the apps' source code, it is resilient to app obfuscation and encryption. We conducted an experiment with two data sets. The first set contains 98 pairs of repackaged apps. The original apps and repackaged ones are compared and we can detect all of these repackaged pairs. The second set contains 125 commercial apps. We compared them pair-wisely and the false positive rate was 0.08%.},

abstract={Multimedia and Web 2.0 can meet up. Despite the success they have obtained in last years, these two domains present some important limitations. In particular, current Web 2.0 based technologies, such as wikis, blogs, podcasts, commonly resort to sequential combinations of contents, rather than exploiting dynamic and synchronized compositions of discrete and continuous media resources. On the other hand, tools for multimedia content authoring and distribution usually lack cooperativeness, interactivity, use of adequate metatagging structures and application mash-up. This paper discusses how by merging these two worlds it is possible to inherit the advantages while removing their limitations. We describe a system exemplar we developed for the cooperative creation, manipulation and sharing of rich media contents.},

abstract={Folksonomy, tag, bookmark and social bookmarking are all concepts that refer to recollection in information retrieval (IR). Recollection can be defined as the effort needed to recall an even, an idea or a resource. In IR, when locating an interesting resource, a user can tag it in order to "memorize" it and retrieve it later. The user chooses the tags according to his/her needs or centers of interest. While previous work has addressed the problem of tag exploitation, to our knowledge, an important dimension is missing. None has focused on the tagging activity itself when considering the users point of view. An important open question is the following: will a user be able to remember tags he/she associated with a document in the past in order to retrieve a document again? Our paper tackles this problem. Considering a user study that implied 32 participants, we evaluate some elements (age, time...) that impacts the recognition and the recall of tags used in the past. This result is important specifically as it can be used in order to optimize personalized systems (e.g. user profiling, tag exploitation...).},

pages={355-383},
abstract={The healthcare industry has been slow to join the information technology revolution; handwritten records are still the primary means of organizing patient care. Concerns about patient privacy, the difficulty of developing appropriate computing tools and information technology, high costs, and the resistance of some physicians and nurses have hampered the use of technology in health care. In 2009, the U.S. government committed billions of dollars to health care technology. Many questions remain, however, about how to deploy these resources. In Health Informatics, experts in technology, joined by clinicians, use diabetes--a costly, complex, and widespread disease that involves nearly every facet of the health care system--to examine the challenges of using the tools of information technology to improve patient care. Unlike other books on medical informatics that discuss such topics as computerized order entry and digital medical records, Health Informatics focuses on the patient, charting the information problems patients encounter in different stages of the disease. [Chapters discuss ubiquitous computing as a tool to move diabetes care out of the doctor's office, technology and chronic disease management, educational gaming as a way to help patients understand their disease, patient access to information, and methodological and theoretical concerns.] We need both technologists and providers at the drawing board in order to design and deploy effective digital tools for health care. This book examines and exemplifies this necessary collaboration.},

abstract={With an ever increasing amount of content, we heavily rely on search engine to locate documents. Manual content Tagging can improve search results by allowing search engines to exploit tags generated by content authors. Manual tagging method introduces issues of bias and inconsistency from ad-hoc tagging, and increase burden to the authors. In this paper, we first introduce a semantic tagging engine that automatically generates semantic tags for the given documents. This tagging engine provides the ground for realizing semantic search, based on meanings of search terms and content tags. Then we present a Semantic Knowledge Management Tool (SKMT) as a semantic search and knowledge management platform to search, analyze and manage enterprise content. SKMT can scan different content sources and generate indexes of semantic keywords. Its user-friendly interface allows users to manage various data sources, search, explore and visualize search results at semantic level. Higher precision of semantic search and semantic data visualization are also demonstrated with examples as benefits of SKMT.},

abstract={In this work, we address a novel problem about tag co-occurrence relationship prediction across heterogeneous networks. Although tag co-occurrence has recently become a hot research topic, many studies mainly focus on how to produce the personalized recommendation leveraging the tag co-occurrence relationship and most of them are considered in a homogeneous network. So far, few studies pay attention to how to predict tag co-occurrence relationship across heterogeneous networks. In order to solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel two-step prediction approach. First, weight path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-occurrence relationships. Experiments are performed on real-world dataset, the Flickr network, with comprehensive measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that weight path-based heterogeneous topological features have substantial advantages over commonly used link prediction approaches in predicting co-occurrence relations in information networks.},

Meanwhile, social user tagging is creating rich multimedia content on the Web. In this paper, we propose to combine the two tagging approaches in a search-based framework. For an unlabeled image, we first retrieve its visual neighbors from a large user-tagged image database. We then select relevant tags from the result images to annotate the unlabeled image. To tackle the unreliability and sparsity of user tagging, we introduce a joint-modality tag relevance estimation method which efficiently addresses both textual and visual clues. Experiments on 1.5 million Flickr photos and 10 000 Corel images verify the proposed method.},

abstract={Associating image content with their geographic locations has been increasingly pursued in the computer vision community in recent years. In a recent work, large collections of geotagged images were found to be helpful in estimating geo-locations of query images by simple visual nearest-neighbors search. In this paper, we leverage user tags along with image content to infer the geo-location. Our model builds upon the fact that the visual content and user tags of pictures can provide significant hints about their geo-locations. Using a large collection of over a million geotagged photographs, we build location probability maps of user tags over the entire globe. These maps reflect the picture-taking and tagging behaviors of thousands of users from all over the world, and reveal interesting tag map patterns. Visual content matching is performed using multiple feature descriptors including tiny images, color histograms, GIST features, and bags of textons. The combination of visual content matching and local tag probability maps forms a strong geo-inference engine. Large-scale experiments have shown significant improvements over pure visual content-based geo-location inference.},

This can lead to recommending LOs that are beyond the teachers' current ability to use in their teaching practice. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem and propose, as a first step, a set of mapping rules for aligning teachers' ICT competences and LO metadata elements.

abstract={As an alternative to traditional client-server systems, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems provide major advantages in terms of scalability, autonomy and dynamic behavior of peers, and decentralization of control. Thus, they are well suited for large-scale data sharing in distributed environments. Most of the existing P2P approaches for data sharing rely on either structured networks (e.g., DHTs) for efficient indexing, or unstructured networks for ease of deployment, or some combination. However, these approaches have some limitations, such as lack of freedom for data placement in DHTs, and high latency and high network traffic in unstructured networks. To address these limitations, gossip protocols which are easy to deploy and scale well, can be exploited. In this book, we will give an overview of these different P2P techniques and architectures, discuss their trade-offs, and illustrate their use for decentralizing several large-scale data sharing applications.

abstract={Most explanations of the user behavior while interacting with the web are based on a top-down approach, where the entire Web, viewed as a vast collection of pages and interconnection links, is used to predict how the users interact with it. A prominent example of this approach is the random-surfer model, the core ingredient behind Google's PageRank. This model exploits the linking structure of the Web to estimate the percentage of web surfers viewing any given page. Contrary to the top-down approach, a bottom-up approach starts from the user and incrementally builds the dynamics of the web as the result of the users' interaction with it. The second approach has not being widely investigated, although there are numerous advantages over the top-down approach regarding (at least) personalization and decentralization of the required infrastructure for web tools. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach to study the web dynamics based on web-related data browsed, collected, tagged, and semi-organized by end users. Our approach has been materialized into a hybrid bottom-up search engine that produces search results based solely on user provided web-related data and their sharing among users. We conduct an extensive experimental study to demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of user generated web-related data, their strength, and weaknesses as well as to compare the search results of our bottom-up search engine with those of a traditional one. Our study shows that a bottom-up search engine starts from a core consisting of the most interesting part of the Web (according to user opinions) and incrementally (and measurably) improves its ranking, coverage, and accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be integrated with PageRank, resulting in a new page ranking algorithm that can uniquely combine link analysis with users' preferences.},

abstract={Social tagging is a major characteristic of Web 2.0. A social tagging system can be modeled with a tripartite network of users, resources, and tags. In this paper, we investigate how to enhance Web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method called “Tripartite Clustering” which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering.

abstract={Recommender Systems is one of the effective tools to deal with information overload issue. Similar with the explicit rating and other implicit rating behaviors such as purchase behavior, click streams, and browsing history etc., the tagging information implies userpsilas important personal interests and preferences information, which can be used to recommend personalized items to users. This paper is to explore how to utilize tagging information to do personalized recommendations. Based on the distinctive three dimensional relationships among users, tags and items, a new user profiling and similarity measure method is proposed. The experiments suggest that the proposed approach is better than the traditional collaborative filtering recommender systems using only rating data.},

abstract={The ability of service providers to adequately describe and publish their Web services is a critical factor to the success in their discovery by interested parties. To date, most of the efforts made towards this direction have mainly focused on the use of ontologies. However, the resulted approaches impose centralized control of the ontology vocabularies and/or schemas, suffer from considerable interoperability issues and require complex, heavyweight technologies. In this paper we present our ongoing work on a peer-to-peer platform supporting publication and discovery of Web services in a socially intelligent manner. The novelty of our approach is that it combines the P2P architecture with the principles of the social Web to enable autonomous, decentralized semantic annotation and maintenance of Web service descriptions, through the collective intelligence emerging by the social networking interactions between service providers and requesters.},

abstract={Currently in the Internet many collaborative tagging sites exist, but there is the need for a service to integrate the data from the multiple sites to form a large and unified set of collaborative data from which users can have more accurate and richer information than from a single site. In our paper, we have proposed a collective collaborative tagging (CCT) service architecture in which both service providers and individual users can merge folksonomy data (in the form of keyword tags) stored in different sources to build a larger, unified repository. We have also examined a range of algorithms that can be applied to different problems in folksonomy analysis and information discovery. These algorithms address several common problems for online systems: searching, getting recommendations, finding communities of similar users, and finding interesting new information by trends. Our contributions are to (a) systematically examine the available public algorithms' application to tag-based folksonomies, and (b) to propose a service architecture that can provide these algorithms as online capabilities.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years based on their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. Besides helping user to organize his/her personal collections, a tag also can be regarded as a user's or expert's personal opinion expression. Thus, the tagging information can be used to make recommendations. In this paper, an innovative architecture for a tag-based recommender system dedicated to the e-learning environments is introduced. This system could support learners by recommending tags and learning resources, online learning activities or optimal browsing pathways, based on their preferences, learning style, knowledge level and the browsing history of other learners with similar characteristics.},

abstract={With the popularity of Web 2.0, people start using tags to label web resources, some even go further by applying Semantic Web technologies to tags. While normal tags impose too many limitations thus not powerful enough, semantic tags are too flexible to address issues like efficiency and quality. We present a tagging system that is built upon Semantic Web technologies and a semantic element is only chosen if we have a clear objective. The system can be used in PubMed, a database of over 19 million citations of biomedical articles, as an auxiliary system to improve the article locating ability a lot with acceptable trade off. We describe the system architecture and the optimizations apply to the system, then we present test results of several random generated test cases. The test results show that when running on medium scale tag repository, our system has quick amortized response time and acceptable memory usage. At last we present validation and correction strategies to deal with unreasonable tag relations in our system.},

year={2011},
pages={205-210},
abstract={The Semantic Web was introduced in 1999 as a method of interrelating information to help computers derive conclusions based on the links between data. With the rising popularity of Social Networks though, unconnected pieces of information have only chaotically increased instead of becoming parts of well-organised Taxonomies. In this paper, we suggest a system which will take advantage of the Social Web and put it to work so that it will operate under the common cause of categorising old and new data into an unlimited Semantic Ontology. This ontology will be created gradually and ever-changing, like a versatile encyclopaedia of information compiled from interconnected data. With the addition of a 3D Web interface on top of the ontology management mechanisms, the entire experience will become more user friendly, providing graphical presentation of all opinions and interpretations in a clear and comparable manner.},

Multimedia sensor networks for environmental monitoring present a different scenario. Volumes of data are large and sensors may be located in areas of limited or poor connectivity. Typical cloud solutions do not work. In this paper we present techniques we have used to collect and analyse data from distributed sensors. These include moving some or all data, moving data summaries and moving computation. Where networked bandwidth is low we employ sneaker net to move data from sensors to servers and from servers to volunteers for analysis, in much the same way as advocated by Gray and Szalay.},

abstract={Social bookmarking services allow a user to make her personal collection of favorite web resources accessible by the public. The content of this collection can attract users of “similar minds” and therefore has tremendous potential to enable networking and collaboration. In this research, we analyzed a large dataset collected from one of the most popular social bookmarking services. To understand why there is a large gap between a user's explicit network and her implicit user-user association networks based on common resources or common tags, we compared a users' bookmark resources and tags to those of her explicit network members. Our results suggest that a typical social bookmarking service user does not create her explicit network based on common interests. We discuss the implications behind the gap between a user's explicit network and implicit network and propose solutions to enhance and improve the “social” functions of social bookmarking services.},

abstract={Tags can be used to annotate resources on the web. This enables users to share or browse the resources or retrieve them in future. Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose rarity of a Web page in a category given by a user to find useful information that a few people know. A rare Web page is a page that belongs to a given category and that is atypical in the category. We define a probability that the page is a rare Web page in the given category as a rarity score. The rarity score is a product of a relevancy score and an a typicality score. The relevancy is a probability that a Web page belongs to a category given by a user. The a typicality is a conditional probability that a page is atypical in the category when it belongs to the category. Both probabilities are calculated by using tags of social bookmark services and words in Web pages. We evaluated the proposed relevancy score by classifying whether Web pages belong to a certain category. We also evaluated the proposed rarity as a metric for ranking Web pages, and compared the rankings by relevancy and a typicality. We confirmed usefulness of the rarity score to find relevant and atypical pages.},

abstract={Web page recommender systems provide users with web pages they might be interested in. Users then select some of the recommended web pages that catch their interest by making a relevance judgment. However, if web page recommender systems do not offer enough useful information for the relevance judgment, users would end up reading irrelevant web pages or overlook relevant web pages. To provide information for the relevance judgment, we propose a novel method for generating personalized snippets for web page recommender systems. Our method directly uses the reasons the web pages are recommended to the user. This use of reasons enables snippets to be selected that better reflect the interest of the user. Moreover, our method can work with various web page recommender systems. It also leverages the maximum coverage summarization model to generate personalized snippets. The results of an experiment on a manually created dataset show that our method is more effective than a personalized summarization model.},

abstract={The performance of many emerging communication paradigms depend on high levels of cooperation amongst the peers in the network. Although an individual's best strategy may be to selfishly consume resources without reciprocation, the optimal social performance requires agents in the network to behave in an altruistic manner. This paper considers a P2P data dissemination scenario, and applies an autonomic trust protocol that forms social network structures to incentive cooperation. Trust links are formed according to the simple criterion that `individuals seek to interact with others at least as cooperative as themselves' and these links are used to prioritise the choice of peers to interact with. The success of the protocol is validated through a prisoner's dilemma based simulation which uses the similarity of interest between peers to define pay-offs. While the variation in interests reduces the average payoff (per iteration) received by the most cooperative individuals, only the most `divergent' and uncooperative nodes are heavily affected and ostracized from interaction by other cooperative nodes.},

abstract={Folksonomy, a system for social tagging or collaborative tagging, is popular in Semantic Web research. Folksonomy is applied to items, such as music pieces, which their personalized tags can be annotated by users. Recommendation systems can use these tags to produce meaningful information. Clustering methods, such as the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) method, can be applied in the context of recommendation system. This paper proposes the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (IFAHC) algorithm for recommendation using social tagging. The Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) concept is used to represent tag values which are vague and uncertain. IFAHC can cluster items represented by using IFS into different groups. The application of IFAHC to music recommendation is used to demonstrate the usability of the proposed method.},

abstract={This paper provides a general introduction to the concept of implicit human-centered tagging (IHCT) - the automatic extraction of tags from nonverbal behavioral feedback of media users. The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be "implicit". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented). The paper discusses these issues in detail and provides an overview of pioneering efforts in the field.},

abstract={Social software such as Wikis and WebLogs have enabled global knowledge sharing communities to emerge. As with most of the current Web content, the knowledge captured is for human consumption only and too unstructured to allow automated reasoning. On the other hand, while sharing and reuse of knowledge are often the goal behind the development of a knowledge base or ontology, there is still currently little support even at the level of a version control system that notifies users when a module being checked-in has been edited by someone else. A collaborative learning approach is introduced which extends a combined rule and case based knowledge acquisition technique known as multiple classification ripple down rules to allow multiple users to view, define and refine a knowledge base over time and space.},

abstract={In recent years we have witnessed expansion of Web 2.0. Its main feature is allowing users' collaboration in content creation using various means, e.g. annotations, discussions, wikis, blogs or tags. This approach has influenced also web-based learning, for which the term "Learning 2.0" has been introduced. In this paper we explore using tags in such systems. Tags can be used for improving of searching, categorization of web-documents, creating folksonomies and ontologies or enhancing the user-model. Another aspect of tags is that they act as a bridge between resources and users to create a social network. We integrated tags in a learning framework ALEF and experimentally evaluated their usage in education process.},

abstract={An efficient pedagogical strategy in an Open Social Learning environment is required for effective learning on the web. Increased collaboration among the learners and mentors makes the learning experience efficient. This paper proposes an enhanced Pedagogical strategy for searching content through the use of ontologies and the learner's profile. The proposed system makes use of ontologies and learner profiles for crawling, indexing and organizing content. The content is then filtered based on the learner and "learner like" learners' profile to provide a rich Open Social Learning experience. Natural Language Processing is then used to semantically categorize the learning content. It has been shown that this proposed pedagogical strategy, using the ontologies and user profiles for search, Natural Language Processing for programmatic content categorization and graph database to identify learning styles of the underrepresented learners, provides an enhanced learner centered online learning experience.},

abstract={A lot of tool support for semantic video annotation is already available, supporting users or even automating tasks on different granularity levels in different metadata formats. In some domains like soccer or medicine, highly specialized solutions are even more advanced and create many new business opportunities. Still, support for mobile Web-enabled and collaborative general semantic video annotation is limited, mostly due to the high costs of developing and running such services. SeViAnno is a long-term development addressing in particular such engineering tasks. The current release is based on RESTful Web services enabling much easier integration of new input and output formats on the metadata management level as well as an easier development process of mobile and Web-based clients. This will be demonstrated by different existing prototypes. Together with a cloud computing-oriented open-source strategy this engineering solution is more sustainable and can be exploited with lower costs.},

abstract={Nowadays, when management of requirements is considered one of the principal endeavors causes of success or failure, enterprises need to find a systematic way to promote effective methods for the elicitation of requirements, jointly working in collaboration with stakeholders and developers. However, most of the tools for requirements management are not simple enough to encourage the stakeholders' participation. Contributing towards this goal, this paper responds with a proposal to facilitate collaborative requirements management, which supports the four classical processes of requirements management: elicitation, analysis, specification and validation. The elicitation and analysis of requirements is made with the support of wiki-based front-ends and then, the requirements are specified and handled in an ontology, thus enabling advanced reasoning capabilities able to support the requirements validation and enterprises' resources management (e.g. Prioritize solutions) during the course of products and services development lifecycle.},

title={Evaluating the Impact of Attacks in Collaborative Tagging Environments},
year={2009},
volume={4},
pages={136-143},
abstract={The proliferation of social Web technologies such as collaborative tagging has led to an increasing awareness of their vulnerability to misuse. Attackers may attempt to distort the system's adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. Prior work on recommender systems has shown that studying different attack types, their properties and their impact, can help identify robust algorithms that make these systems more secure and less vulnerable to manipulation.Unlike traditional recommender systems, a tagging system includes multiple retrieval algorithms to facilitate browsing of resources, users and tags. The challenge is, therefore, evaluating the impact of various types of attacks across different navigation options. In this paper we develop a framework for characterizing attacks against tagging systems. We then propose a methodology for evaluating their global impact based on PageRank. Using real data from a popular tagging systems, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of several attack types. Our results help us understand how much effort is needed from an attacker to change the behavior of a tagging system and which attack types are more successful against such systems.},

year={2008},
pages={13-18},
abstract={Social tagging systems have recently became very popular as a means to classify large sets of resources shared among on-line communities over the social Web. However, the folksonomies resulting from the use of these systems revealed limitations : tags are ambiguous and their spelling may vary, and folksonomies are difficult to exploit in order to retrieve or exchange information. This article compares the recent attempts to overcome these limitations and to support the use of folksonomies with formal languages and ontologies from the Semantic Web.},

abstract={With the vast amount of source code that is publicly available today, searching for code has become an integral part of the programming experience. While a few dedicated code search engines are available, we contend in this paper that they have not nearly reached their full potential. Particularly, we believe that it is necessary for code search engines to not merely index code, but also construct a rich network of social-technical information that surrounds that code. With such information, much richer queries can be issued and novel interfaces can be built through which the results of such queries can be explored more intuitively. We make the case for social-technical code search, introduce six categories of social-technical information and how it would enhance search, and briefly introduce CodeExchange, our prototype platform we are developing to explore social-technical code search.},

abstract={The application of information retrieval techniques to search tasks in software engineering is made difficult by the lexical gap between search queries, usually expressed in natural language (e.g. English), and retrieved documents, usually expressed in code (e.g. programming languages). This is often the case in bug and feature location, community question answering, or more generally the communication between technical personnel and non-technical stake holders in a software project. In this paper, we propose bridging the lexical gap by projecting natural language statements and code snippets as meaning vectors in a shared representation space. In the proposed architecture, word embeddings are rst trained on API documents, tutorials, and reference documents, and then aggregated in order to estimate semantic similarities between documents. Empirical evaluations show that the learned vector space embeddings lead to improvements in a previously explored bug localization task and a newly de ned task of linking API documents to computer programming questions.},

Furthermore, in this study, we also introduce the concept of knowledge map, presenting the amount of objective data in graphical interface to reflect the overall system, and general application, distribution and preference of resources, in order to compensate for the disadvantage that the tagging system can only read one-dimensional information.

We have developed a MATLAB toolbox called CTAGGER to enable a user-friendly, semi-structured and expandable strategy for event annotation in dynamic brain imaging and other time-series. To facilitate common labeling and comparison across data collections and laboratories, an individual's annotation can be collected in a common community database to encourage annotation reuse. The tools allow the creation of multiple event overlays to facilitate the reuse and combination of brain imaging data for multiple analyses.},

Given the domain ontology and the analysis results as input, an abduction process is adopted to compute the semantics-based interpretations.

Metadata of that type are invaluable as it is difficult for ordinary computer software to extract equivalent metadata from the Web. Acquiring image metadata such as the type and location of objects in images requires a computer to use machine learning techniques, needing training with sample images and Web search techniques, with the outcome that only limited image metadata are extracted. Furthermore, the semantic image relationship metadata is based upon peoplepsilas image perception, hence user feedback is required to acquire it. KnownStyleNoLife provides a social value to users in return for their explicit annotations. It is a novel approach to harness human power to acquire relevant image metadata.},

title={Detecting similar repositories on GitHub},
year={2017},
pages={13-23},
abstract={GitHub contains millions of repositories among which many are similar with one another (i.e., having similar source codes or implementing similar functionalities). Finding similar repositories on GitHub can be helpful for software engineers as it can help them reuse source code, build prototypes, identify alternative implementations, explore related projects, find projects to contribute to, and discover code theft and plagiarism. Previous studies have proposed techniques to detect similar applications by analyzing API usage patterns and software tags. However, these prior studies either only make use of a limited source of information or use information not available for projects on GitHub. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can effectively detect similar repositories on GitHub. Our approach is designed based on three heuristics leveraging two data sources (i.e., GitHub stars and readme files) which are not considered in previous works. The three heuristics are: repositories whose readme files contain similar contents are likely to be similar with one another, repositories starred by users of similar interests are likely to be similar, and repositories starred together within a short period of time by the same user are likely to be similar. Based on these three heuristics, we compute three relevance scores (i.e., readme-based relevance, stargazer-based relevance, and time-based relevance) to assess the similarity between two repositories. By integrating the three relevance scores, we build a recommendation system called RepoPal to detect similar repositories. We compare RepoPal to a prior state-of-the-art approach CLAN using one thousand Java repositories on GitHub. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RepoPal achieves a higher success rate, precision and confidence over CLAN.},

year={2008},
pages={58-65},
abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed.},

abstract={We present a method to detect social events in a set of pictures from an image hosting service (Flickr). This method relies on the analysis of user-generated tags, by using statistical models trained on both a small set of manually annotated data and a large data set collected from the Internet. Social event modeling relies on multi-span topic model based on LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Experiments are conducted in the experimental setup of MediaEval'2011 evaluation campaign. The proposed system outperforms significantly the best system of this benchmark, reaching a F-measure score of about 71%.},

title={Animated Geo-temporal Clusters for Exploratory Search in Event Data Document Collections},
year={2014},
pages={157-163},
abstract={This paper presents a novel visual analytics technique developed to support exploratory search tasks for event data document collections. The technique supports discovery and exploration by clustering results and overlaying cluster summaries onto coordinated timeline and map views. Users can also explore and interact with search results by selecting clusters to filter and re-cluster the data with animation used to smooth the transition between views. The technique demonstrates a number of advantages over alternative methods for displaying and exploring geo-referenced search results and spatio-temporal data. Firstly, cluster summaries can be presented in a manner that makes them easy to read and scan. Listing representative events from each cluster also helps the process of discovery by preserving the diversity of results. Also, clicking on visual representations of geo-temporal clusters provides a quick and intuitive way to navigate across space and time simultaneously. This removes the need to overload users with the display of too many event labels at any one time. The technique was evaluated with a group of nineteen users and compared with an equivalent text based exploratory search engine.},

pages={669-676},
abstract={As larger and larger amounts of data are harvested, finding just the right piece of information out of this noisy and heterogeneous ocean of data remains challenging. Many widely adopted scientific data search engines continue to be mainly based on text semantics. However, it is not uncommon in scientific big data applications to face collected data that do not possess text information. In this scenario, search engines fail to retrieve potentially relevant data. For instance, even though Pangaea, a digital data library and a publisher for earth system science, contains more than 400,000 datasets, more than 98% lack sufficient text information. In this work, we propose a novel pseudo relevance feedback method based on spatio-temporal and text (STT) information for scientific big data: STT-PRF. Although STT-PRF may simultaneously use STT information, we show that the missing values in space, time or/and the text are handled efficiently. STT-PRF is especially robust even without text information. We tested our STT-PRF method using the Pangaea repository on our Cross-DB Search Platform, which is a search engine for scientific big data based on various latent correlations. Experimental evaluations on such standard metrics as nDCG and Precision/Recall show that STT-PRF outperforms the standard baseline methods.},

abstract={Linked Data is a methodology to publish data on the Web that facilitates the federation of data sources. Following this methodology, a huge quantity of data is being published on the Web of Data, but very little is currently consumed by educational applications. This paper proposes to overcome this situation by relating educational vocabularies to the ones already used on the Web of Data. This way, educational applications can take advantage of the data published on the Web even if such data was not published for educational purposes. As a case study, the vocabulary used by an educational tool search system, called Ontoolsearch, is related to ICT tool descriptions published by DBpedia and Factforge. Evaluation results show that 2905 tool descriptions can be retrieved from the Web of Data to be consumed by Ontoolsearch. In addition, most of these descriptions have a similar quality to the ones manually published by an educational tool expert.},

This paper describes how intelligent web tools can provide new opportunities for knowledge representation, formalization, management and sharing. It firstly introduces the concept of “intelligent web” as a synergic combination of Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies.

abstract={A novel framework for music genre classification, namely the joint sparse low-rank representation (JSLRR) is proposed in order to: 1) smooth the noise in the test samples, and 2) identify the subspaces that the test samples lie onto. An efficient algorithm is proposed for obtaining the JSLRR and a novel classifier is developed, which is referred to as the JSLRR-based classifier. Special cases of the JSLRR-based classifier are the joint sparse representation-based classifier and the low-rank representation-based one. The performance of the three aforementioned classifiers is compared against that of the sparse representation-based classifier, the nearest subspace classifier, the support vector machines, and the nearest neighbor classifier for music genre classification on six manually annotated benchmark datasets. The best classification results reported here are comparable with or slightly superior than those obtained by the state-of-the-art music genre classification methods.},

title={Semantic Stability and Implicit Consensus in Social Tagging Streams},
year={2014},

pages={108-120},
abstract={One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.},

abstract={Today's mobile Internet service portals offer thousands of services and mobile devices can host plenty of applications, documents and web URLs. Hence, for average mobile users there is an increasing cognitive burden in finding the most appropriate service among the many available. On the other hand, methodologies such as bookmarks and resource tagging require a great arranging effort to handle increasing resources. To help mobile users in managing and using this personal information space, new levels of granularity should be introduced in the organization of services, together with some degree of self-awareness. This paper proposes a situation-aware service recommender that helps locating services proactively. In the recommender, a semantic layer determines one or more user current situations by using domain knowledge expressed in terms of ontology and semantic rules. A fuzzy inference layer manages the vagueness of some contextual condition of these rules and outputs an uncertainty degree for each situation. Based on this degree, the recommender proposes a set of specific resources.},

This process can be modelled as a social network, also known as co-tagging network, where the actors are the taggers and the relationships between them are the common tags that they have used. Co-tagging networks have been studied by applying social network analysis (SNA) metrics so as to: (a) draw significant insights about the influence of central users to the (tagging) behaviour of other users and (b) identify clusters of taggers based on the content of the tags that they use. Nevertheless, there are no previous works, which have studied co-tagging networks in the field of Learning Object Repositories (LORs). In this paper we aim to address this issue by studying the co-tagging network of a specific LOR, namely the OpenScienceResources (OSR) Repository.},

The proposed method applies a method that supports car design using the image based collaborative filtering utilizing sensibility as a starting point in the development process. Although a collaborative filtering process can well predict the users' interests and preferences, it cannot efficiently analyze de-sign information while considering the con-tents of specific items. The process extracts features from the image data that the users are interested in to mitigate a problem, which is regarded as an undulated analysis, and then recom-mends an automotive design by combining the image filtering and collaborative filtering that use the static relationship between the users' preference and the image color information. The pro-posed system provides a recommendation by the image based collaborative filtering. Ultimately, this paper suggests empirical applications to verify the adequacy and validity of this system.},

title={Tag Sense Disambiguation for Clarifying the Vocabulary of Social Tags},
year={2009},
volume={4},
pages={729-734},
abstract={Tagging is one of the most popular services in Web 2.0. As a special form of tagging, social tagging is done collaboratively by many users, which forms a so-called folksonomy. As tagging has become widespread on the Web, the tag vocabulary is now very informal, uncontrolled, and personalized. For this reason, many tags are unfamiliar and ambiguous to users so that they fail to understand the meaning of each tag. In this paper, we propose a tag sense disambiguating method, called tag sense disambiguation (TSD), which works in the social tagging environment. TSD can be applied to the vocabulary of social tags, thereby enabling users to understand the meaning of each tag through Wikipedia. To find the correct mappings from del.icio.us tags to Wikipedia articles, we define the local neighbor tags, the global neighbor tags, and finally the neighbor tags that would be the useful key-words for disambiguating the sense of each tag based on the tag co-occurrences. The automatically built mappings are reasonable in most cases. The experiment shows that TSD can find the correct mappings with high accuracy.},

abstract={More and more content on the Web is generated by users. To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

title={TagLearner: A P2P Classifier Learning System from Collaboratively Tagged Text Documents},
year={2009},
pages={495-500},
abstract={The amount of text data on the Internet is growing at a very fast rate. Online text repositories for news agencies, digital libraries and other organizations currently store giga and tera-bytes of data. Large amounts of unstructured text poses a serious challenge for data mining and knowledge extraction. End user participation coupled with distributed computation can play a crucial role in meeting these challenges. In many applications involving classification of text documents, Web users often participate in the tagging process. This collaborative tagging results in the formation of large scale peer-to-peer (P2P) systems which can function, scale and self-organize in the presence of highly transient population of nodes and do not need a central server for co-ordination. In this paper, we describe TagLearner, a P2P classifier learning system for extracting patterns from text data where the end users can participate both in the task of labeling the data and building a distributed classifier on it. We present a novel distributed linear programming based classification algorithm which is asynchronous in nature. The paper also provides extensive empirical results on text data obtained from an online repository - the NSF Abstracts Data.},

abstract={We propose four fuzzy-logic based models of tag recommendation, which are based on the interpretation of word frequency as a fuzzy membership function, and provide experimental results of tag recommendation for a variety of text datasets using different fuzzy logic operators. The novelty of the proposed models is the use of fuzzy logic modeling concepts to define a set of tags, the use of an existing set of tags for the selection of tags to strengthen the selection of most relevant (i.e., commonly used) tags, and the possibility to use an ontology to select semantically generalized tags. A system developed using the proposed models is adaptive (adapts the recommended tags to the existing set of tags), has a feedback (after each tagging, the set of tags and the dictionary are updated), is personalized (each user develops its own set of tags), and is semantics-aware (uses an ontology to refine tags). The models are validated using five sets of texts with different topics (technology, cooking, carrier, scientific, nature) and different length.},

abstract={Most existing systems recommend songs to the user based on the popularity of songs and singers. However, the system proposed in this paper is driven by an emerging and somewhat different need in the music industry-promoting new talents. The system recommends songs based on the novelty of singers (or artists) and their similarity to the user's favorite artists. Novel artists whose popularity is on the rise have a higher priority to be recommended. Specifically, given a user's favorite artists, the system first determines the candidate artists based on their similarity with the favorite artists and then selects those who have a higher novelty score than the favorite artists. Then, the system outputs a playlist composed of the most popular songs of the selected artists. The proposed system can be integrated into most existing systems. Its performance is evaluated using the Spotify Radio Recommender as a reference and a pool of 100 subjects recruited on campus. Experimental results show that our system achieves a high novelty score and a competitive user-preference score.},

Though the current semantic-based service discovery methods enhance the recall rate and precision in a way, most of the semantic-based service discovery methods are based on the new model of the semantic web and the ontology language, the number of the services based on the model of the semantic web and the ontology language is so little that these methods can not been used effectively. In this paper, we bring forward a new service discovery method based on the service tags. In order to discover service based on the services tags, we bring forward the algorithm QEBT and QPBT.

abstract={In collaborative software development projects, work items are used as a mechanism to coordinate tasks and track shared development work. In this paper, we explore how “tagging,” a lightweight social computing mechanism, is used to communicate matters of concern in the management of development tasks. We present the results from two empirical studies over 36 and 12 months, respectively, on how tagging has been adopted and what role it plays in the development processes of several professional development projects with more than 1,000 developers in total. Our research shows that the tagging mechanism was eagerly adopted by the teams, and that it has become a significant part of many informal processes. Different kinds of tags are used by various stakeholders to categorize and organize work items. The tags are used to support finding of tasks, articulation work, and information exchange. Implicit and explicit mechanisms have evolved to manage the tag vocabulary. Our findings indicate that lightweight informal tool support, prevalent in the social computing domain, may play an important role in improving team-based software development practices.},

abstract={Recent research shows the potential of utilizing data collected through Web 2.0 applications to capture domain evolution. Relying on external data sources, however, often introduces delays due to the time spent retrieving data from these sources. The method introduced in this paper streamlines the data acquisition process by applying optimal stopping theory. An extensive evaluation demonstrates how such an optimization improves the processing speed of an ontology refinement component which uses Delicious to refine ontologies constructed from unstructured textual data while having no significant impact on the quality of the refinement process. Domain experts compare the results retrieved from optimal stopping with data obtained from standardized techniques to assess the effect of optimal stopping on data quality and the created domain ontology.},

abstract={The ldquowisdom of the crowdsrdquo is a concept used to describe the utility of harnessing group behaviour, where user opinion evolves over time and the opinion of the masses collectively demonstrates wisdom. Web 2.0 is a new medium where users are not just consumers, but are also contributors. By contributing content to the system, users become part of the network and relationships between users and content can be derived. Example applications are collaborative bookmarking networks such as delicious and file sharing applications such as YouTube and Flickr. These networks rely on user contributed content, described and classified using tags. The wealth of user generated content can be hard to navigate and search due to difficulties in comparing documents with similar tags and the application of traditional information retrieval scoring techniques are limited. Evaluating the time evolving interests of users may be used to derive quality of content. In this paper, we propose a technique to rank documents based on reputation. The reputation is a combination of the number of bookmarkers, the reputation of the bookmarking user and the time dynamics of the document. Experimental results and analysis are presented on a large collaborative IBM bookmarking network called Dogear.},

abstract={Recommender systems, in the collaborative filtering variation, are popular tools used to drive users out of information clutter, by letting them select Â¿interestingÂ¿ items based on the preferences of similarly minded users. In such a system as more users come in to evaluate items (be they information pieces, products or otherwise), a network of users starts to be formed. In this paper we are interested in the dynamics of such a network, in particular we investigate if there is a hidden law that captures the essence of such networks irrespective of their size. The discovery of such a law would allow, among other usages, generation of synthetic data sets, realistic enough to be used for simulation purposes. Furthermore, it would be useful for information-seeking activities such as locating known experts or influential users on a particular subject. Similar work in related fields suggested the existence of power-laws, which seem to be ubiquitous. However, in our work we did not detect the presence of such a law, instead we discovered an exponential relationship between the nodes of a graph representing users, and edges representing similarity between users. In particular the logarithm of the degree of node is linearly related to the ranking of the node in a decreasing order. The above conclusion is justified by extended experiments on two versions of the movie lens data set (one comprised 100,000 user evaluations, while the other comprised 1,000,0000 evaluations).},

We associate each node in this graph with a tag preference vector, which is then refined through a random walk procedure over this graph. The tag preferences of the active user and resource are finally combined to generate the recommended tags. We conduct experiments on the Delicious.

abstract={Using the internet for online information search has become the current main channel of getting information when tourists design a travel plan. However, with the rise of the internet and e-commerce websites, tourists are often submerged in a lot of information search and product selection. According to the customer service information of travel website, design a personalized travel package recommendation approach based on TD-LDA Model. The method uses topic analysis to extract the activities which tourists may interested in. And give full consideration to the duration of travel, the new package generated by travel company and other information to recommend personalized travel packages for tourists. Experimental results on real-world online customer service data show that this method can effectively extract the interests of tourists for travel package recommendation.},

title={Automatic Tag Recommendation for Weblogs},
year={2009},
volume={1},
pages={546-549},
abstract={There have been many researches on how to recommend tags for weblogs. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tag recommendation algorithm, which can be used in the large-scale and real-time data process effectively and efficiently. Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.},

abstract={The emergence of concepts and applications categorized under the Web 2.0 paradigm, along with the rise of social networks and virtual communities, provide an opportunity to enhance the interactive and collaborative dimension of learning. More than before, it is today possible to create virtual "places" where people share their ideas and experience and learn together, developing new skills and competencies. This paper describes a Web-based platform which integrates tools such as blogs, wikis, and folksonomies to create a community of learners and facilitate their personal and professional development. The main features and components of the platform are here illustrated, along with the description of purposefully defined learning processes. The submission to learners of a specific assignment/project to realize, based on management issues and real company cases, is reported as an illustrative example of how the platform leverages the community dimension of Web learning and the competencies development process.},

The paper designed a method which is based on the users' preference that is extracted and analysed from users' historical operating records. A matrix is used for describing the relation between code modules and users' behavior. Two vectors are used to formalize the users' behavior in the dimension of code modules. The two vectors record the information to judge whether the code module needs to be loaded or not. By a series of the calculation, the code modules which are very likely used by the project are selected. Through this method, GIS Software is loaded more efficient.},

title={Tag Meaning Disambiguation through Analysis of Tripartite Structure of Folksonomies},
year={2007},
pages={3-6},
abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy One problem of folksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task.},

abstract={Recent growth in broadband access and proliferation of small personal devices that capture images and videos has led to explosive growth of multimedia content available everywhere - from personal disks to the Web. While digital media capture and upload has become nearly universal with newer device technology, there is still a need for better tools and technologies to search large collections of multimedia data and to find and deliver the right content to a user according to her current needs and preferences. A renewed focus on the subjective dimension in the multimedia lifecycle, from creation, distribution, to delivery and consumption, is required to address this need beyond what is feasible today. Integration of the subjective aspects of the media itself - its affective, perceptual, and physiological potential (both intended and achieved), together with those of the users themselves will allow for personalizing the content access, beyond today's facility. This integration, transforming the traditional multimedia information retrieval (MIR) indexes to more effectively answer specific user needs, will allow a richer degree of personalization predicated on user intention and mode of interaction, relationship to the producer, content of the media, and their history and lifestyle. In this paper, we identify the challenges in achieving this integration, current approaches to interpreting content creation processes, to user modelling and profiling, and to personalized content selection, and we detail future directions. The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section I, we introduce the problem and present some definitions. In Section II, we present a review of the aspects of personalized content and current approaches for the same. Section III discusses the problem of obtaining metadata that is required for personalized media creation and present eMediate as a case study of an integrated media capture environment. Section IV presents the MAGIC system as a case stud- - y of capturing effective descriptive data and putting users first in distributed learning delivery. The aspects of modelling the user are presented as a case study in using user's personality as a way to personalize summaries in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper with a discussion on the emerging challenges and the open problems.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel way of modeling Web services using folksonomies. The key advantage of our model is that it allows a large number of users to participate, easily, in annotating services with tags. This is in contrast to more expressive, logic based models of services, such as semantic Web service models, which require significant expertise for annotation and maintenance. Our folksonomy-based model allows associating semantic constraints on the input and output messages of web service operations using tags obtained from a folksonomy. We show how the model can be used for discovery and composition of services. We also describe a planner that uses this model to compose services and create workflows, automatically. We present performance results for the planner and our experiences in using this model in a sample real-world domain.},

abstract={Social bookmarking and other Web sites allow users submitting their resources and labeling them with arbitrary keywords, called tags, to create folksonomies. These sites usually provide their users tag recommendations in order to help them to find relevant information and resources. However, only very basic techniques are applied for generating recommendations. In this paper, we present a recommender system for a social bookmarking site to generate resource recommendations rather than tag recommendations. Our system is based on two ideas: similar users are interested in similar resources and similar resources have similar tags. Our system generates recommendations by automatically taking into account what resources a user tags and the co-occurrence of tags. Our method is tested on large-scale real life datasets. The experimental results show that our method achieves a good recommendation performance.},

year={2011},
pages={36-43},
abstract={As the collaborative tagging systems such as Delicious, Flickr and Last. fm become more and more popular, a large amount of resources produced by publishers, together with rich semantic metadata, become available. There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy.},

abstract={The idea of using image and video data available in the World-Wide Web (WWW) as training data for classifier construction has received some attention in the past few years. In this paper, we present a novel incremental and scalable web-supervised learning system that continuously learns appearance models for image categories with heterogeneous appearances and improves these models periodically. Simply specifying the name of the concept that has to be learned initializes the proposed system, and there is no further supervision afterwards. Textual and visual information on web sites are used to filter out irrelevant and misleading training images. To obtain a robust, flexible, and updatable way of learning, a novel learning framework is presented that relies on clustering in order to identify visual subclasses before using an ensemble of random forests, called random savanna, for subclass learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed web-supervised learning approach outperforms a support vector machine (SVM), while at the same time being simply parallelizable in the training and testing phases.},

volume={PP},
number={99},
pages={1-13},
abstract={In this paper, we aim at developing a new collaborative filtering recommender system using soft ratings, which is capable of dealing with both imperfect information about user preferences and the sparsity problem. On the one hand, Dempster-Shafer theory is employed for handling the imperfect information due to its advantage in providing not only a flexible framework for modeling uncertain, imprecise, and incomplete information, but also powerful operations for fusion of information from multiple sources. On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones. In the experiments, the developed recommender system is tested on two different data sets; and the experiment results indicate that this system is more effective than CoFiDS, a typical recommender system offering soft ratings.},

pages={1973-1980},
abstract={Social tagging systems allow users to publish different type of resources, such as Web pages or pictures, annotate them using keywords or tags and share their resources with other users. These systems achieved widespread success on the Web on account of the simplicity for organizing resources using open-ended tags. Recently, tag recommendation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problems of ambiguity, syntactic variations and noise in tags cause by the inherent characteristics of natural language. In this work we proposed a content-based approach that generates a list of suggested tags for annotating a given resource starting from an analysis of its textual content exclusively. Thus, the proposed method can be used in situations in which there is not enough information for creating a tag-based user profile or compare the user with others. For extracting the more relevant words different term weighting approaches were evaluated, particularly considering the HTML structure of Web pages and the grammatical category of words in order to determine promising tag candidates. Experimental results of applying this technique to tag recommendation using several term weighting approaches are reported and compared.},

abstract={Mobile devices that are capable of playing Internet videos have become wide-spread in recent years. Because of the enormous offer of video content, the lack of sufficient presentation space on the screen, and the laborious navigation on mobile devices, the video consumption process becomes more complicated for the end-user. To handle this problem, people need new instruments to assist with the hunting, filtering and selection process. We developed a methodology for mobile devices that makes the huge content sources more manageable by creating a user profile and personalizing the offer. This paper reports the structure of the user profile, the user interaction mechanism, and the recommendation algorithm, an improved version of the Bayesian classifier that incorporates aspects of the consumption context (like time, location, and mood of the user) to make the suggestions more accurate.},

The global CouchSurfing network displays a high degree of reciprocal interaction and a large strongly connected component of individuals surfing the globe. This high degree of interaction and reciprocity among participants is enabled by a reputation system that allows individuals to vouch for one another. We find that the strength of a friendship tie is most predictive of whether an individual will vouch for another. However, vouches based on weak ties outnumber those between close friends. We discuss these and other factors that could inform a more robust reputation system.},

Based on focus & context visualization techniques, we enhance facet browser user interfaces with "elastic lists" to make the resulting weighted metadata profiles visually accessible and navigable. The principle is currently developed and tested in several domains.},

pages={586-593},
abstract={Social network plays an important role in information diffusion. Identifying the most influential spreaders can contribute to the prediction of the speed and scale of information dissemination, which is very valuable to business such as advertising delivering. In contrast to common belief that users who are highly connected are most important spreaders, this paper shows that user's social circle play a more important role in information diffusion. In this paper, we firstly define the diversity of a user's social circle, which means the dispersion extent of the user's friend distribution in the network. A method for measuring diversity and broadness of a user's social circle in network is also presented. Preliminary experiment demonstrates that user's social circle does matter in information diffusion. Moreover, a social circle weighted PageRank algorithm which takes both popularity (in-degree) and social circle broadness into account is proposed. Experiments on Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model show that our method in terms of identification of influential spreaders outperforms other methods such as in-degree and PageRank on two real social network datasets.},

abstract={As the number of Web 2.0 sites offering tagging facilities for the users' voluntary content annotation increases, so do the efforts to analyze social phenomena resulting from generated tagging and folksonomies. Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various Web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused.In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data.},

In this work we examine how a folksonomy approach with collaborative location tagging can be used to allow for end users to communicate their whereabouts to others in a way that makes sense within a specific community. The Spots system allows for users to define places based on patterns of WiFi signal strength profiles. The places are tagged with labels describing the place. Different tags can be provided within different communities. A usage study shows a great diversity in how users chose to name places.},

title={Mapping Small Worlds},

pages={219-228},
abstract={Social networks are usually navigable small worlds: individuals are able to find short chains of acquaintances connecting pairs of unrelated nodes. This property can be explained by the fact that nodes are characterized by a series of properties, such as geographical position, work or educational background; the navigation proceeds towards the node that is "most similar" to the destination. Since nodes are likely to be linked with similar individuals, this strategy permits to quickly reach the destination. We approach the problem of creating the information that makes a network navigable. Starting from a given network, and without any other information, we show how nodes can reconstruct, with a scalable and decentralized algorithm, a "network map": a d-dimensional layout that places nodes in a way that reflects the network structure, so that navigability is achieved. Euclidean distance on the layout is used as a measure for node similarity, and efficient routing can be simply achieved by iteratively jumping towards the neighbor that is closest to the destination. The network map provides a means for implementing routing on social networks that can be used in "darknets", that is, anonymous networks where nodes establish connections only if they are mutually trusted. Moreover, the distance between nodes on the network map can be used as a measure of node affinity, and may help in various types of network analysis, for instance to help evaluate reputation in webs of trust, or in order to perform "personalized" ranking.},

abstract={Social image tagging systems mostly suffer from poor performance for image retrieval due to the noisy and incomplete correspondences between user-contributed images and their associated tags. In this letter, we aim to refine tag allocations in the social tagging data provided by these systems. In particular, we propose to harness the tagged and untagged data with a two-stage strategy according to different types of data relations, i.e. item similarity defined by prior knowledge and item co-occurrence learned from data statistics. To solve the sparsity problem, we first introduce a new graph learning (GL) method for enriching the tagging data according to item similarities. Then, we develop a method of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for learning more coherent ternary relations among users, images and tags coupled by the manifold constraints learned from item co-occurrences. Experimental results with the tagging data from the NUS-WIDE dataset have been reported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The social semantic Web has recently emerged as a paradigm in which ontologies (aimed at defining, structuring and sharing information) and collaborative software (used for creating and sharing knowledge) have been merged together. Ontologies provide an effective means of capturing and integrating knowledge for feedback provisioning, while using collaborative activities can support pedagogical theories, such as social constructivism. Both technologies have developed separately in the e-learning domain; representing respectively a teacher-centered and a learner-centered approach for learning environments. In this paper we bridge the gap between these two approaches by leveraging the social semantic Web paradigm, and propose a collaborative semantic-rich learning environment in which folksonomies created from studentspsila collaborative tags contribute to ontology maintenance, and teacher-directed feedback.},

However, the traditional expert-driven development of ontologies is time-consuming and often results in incomplete and inappropriate ontologies.

In this paper, we present a recommendation algorithm in a Web 2.0 platform that supports end users to collaboratively evolve ontologies by suggesting semantic relations between new and existing concepts. We use the Wikipedia category hierarchy to evaluate our algorithm and our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm produces high quality recommendations.},

User tags provide much useful information for user retrieval and precision advertising. However, 64.2% of users in our study have not tagged themselves. This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

abstract={The web is perceived as a new social platform. Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.},

SARVE further incorporates the current context of both the smart conference community and participants in order to model a recommendation process using distributed community detection. Through the integration of the above computations and techniques, we are able to recommend presentation sessions of active participant presenters that may be of high interest to a particular participant.

title={A unified model for stable and temporal topic detection from social media data},
year={2013},
pages={661-672},
abstract={Web 2.0 users generate and spread huge amounts of messages in online social media. Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (e.g., breaking events) and stable topics (e.g., user interests). Due to their different natures, it is important and useful to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However, such a discrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are very short in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporal topics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically, a unified user-temporal mixture model is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model's performance, we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information in a social network, as well as a burst-weighted smoothing scheme that exploits temporal prior information in the time dimension. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposal on two real data sets obtained from Del.icio.us and Twitter. The experimental results verify that our mixture model is able to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in a single detection process. Our mixture model enhanced with the spatial regularization and the burst-weighted smoothing scheme significantly outperforms competitor approaches, in terms of topic detection accuracy and discrimination in stable and temporal topics.},

abstract={The degree of abundance of labeled training data is an important factor in determining the performance of supervised machine learning systems. However, in some applications, labeled data are either costly to collect or easily outdated, resulting in poor generalization of trained machine learners. Nonetheless, there are often related domains where large corpuses of labeled data can be easily obtained. Therefore, we propose a new transfer learning algorithm to adapt a neural network trained on such a related domain to the target domain by grafting additional nodes onto its hidden layer. This neural grafting method is capable of transfering the knowledge embedded in the structures of the trained neural network to the problem in the target domain. Experiments on synthesized and real data sets show that grafted networks achieve good performance with very small amounts of data from the target domain. Compared with existing transfer learning techniques, the proposed neural grafting is easy to tune and computationally simple, with superior performance.},

In this paper, we consider one such platform that was developed for the internal use in a large global enterprise (HP). We present data and analysis of how this social media platform has been used in HP over the past five years. We then present conclusions from this analysis and relate them to work patterns in enterprises with the goal of advancing social media to the next level making them better fit the work context and more relevant for people in their work functions.

abstract={Information Architecture is about organizing and simplifying information, designing and integrating information spaces/systems, and creating ways for people to find and interact with information content. Its goal is to help people understand and manage information and make right decisions accordingly. In the ever-changing social, organizational and technological contexts, Information Architects not only design individual information spaces (e.g., individual websites, software applications, and mobile devices), but also tackle strategic aggregation and integration of multiple information spaces across websites, channels, modalities, and platforms. Not only they create predetermined navigation pathways, but also provide tools and rules for people to organize information on their own and get connected with others. Information Architects work with multi-disciplinary teams to determine the user experience strategy based on user needs and business goals, and make sure the strategy gets carr ed out by following the user-centered design (UCD) process via close collaboration with others. Drawing on the author(s) extensive experience as HCI researchers, User Experience Design practitioner, and Information Architecture instructors, this book provides a balanced view of the IA discipline by applying the IA theories, design principles and guidelines to the IA and UX practices.

abstract={Despite many serious research efforts, personalization in social web is still a challenge. Existing techniques for social networking rely on state of the art Database and Web 2.0 techniques, that don't allow data representation seminally. In this paper we have proposed a method for improving presentation in social web by ontology based knowledge representation that enables semantic profiling in social networking sites. Our ontology bootstraps on mixture of existing semantic web vocabularies involving FOAF, DC and SIOC. Furthermore we have also explained an ontology based architrave for a semantic social networking site. Initially we have selected Academia and Researchers domain for melding ontology.},

title={Self-Calibration: Enabling Self-Management in Autonomous Systems by Preserving Model Fidelity},
year={2012},
pages={308-317},
abstract={Autonomic and autonomous systems exist within a world view of their own. This world view is created from the training data and assumptions that were available at their inception. In most of these systems this world view becomes obsolete over time due to changes in the environment. This brings a level of inaccuracy in the autonomic behavior of the system. When this degradation reaches a certain threshold self-healing or self-optimizing systems generally recreate the world view using current data and assumptions. However, the self-optimization process is akin to kill a fly with a hammer for minor tuning of the world view. Instead we propose the idea of self-calibration for self-managing these systems. We define self-calibration as the ability of the system to perceive the need for and the ability to execute minimal tuning to bridge the gap between system's world view and incoming information about the outside world. In this paper we present a case for considering self-calibration as a self-* enabling property of systems specifically for time-critical systems using data-centric AI technologies. We present our case by discussing three case studies from different domains where self-calibration enables a system to become self-healing or self-optimizing. We then place self-calibration in a generic system and explicitly describe the types of systems in which self-calibration can be implemented and the benefits that one can accrue from its inclusion.},

“Folksonomized Ontology and the 3E Steps Technique to Support Ontology Evolvement”
by Hugo Alves, Andre Santanche
in Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 18, August 2012, pp. 19-30Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions -from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Step- technique - Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution -, which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy - expressed in a FO - to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool.},

title={A multi-level hierarchical index structure for supporting efficient similarity search on tag sets},
year={2012},
pages={1-12},
abstract={Social communication websites has been an emerging type of a Web service that helps users to share their resources. For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

Topic detection has to resolve the problem of its lower quality and large amount of noisy. This paper not only provides a solution for detecting hot topics, but also giving its semantic descriptions as result. Our method integrates two kinds of term features (local features and global features), and use single pass clustering to perform topic detection in a web forum. It's efficient to filter non-topic documents and get readable descriptions of topic in our system. By comparison with baseline and topic model LDA, our method gets better performance and readable result.},

Results of these service matching are not realistic as the matching's done by analyzing description of the web service. In order to realize automatic Service matching accuracy there is a need to adopt web2.0 social participation about the web services into service matching modules to achieve desired result. In this paper we propose a new approach is proposed which use web2.0 social participation on web services and clustering methods. Initially services are clustered based on the semantic similarity score in co-relation with the functional semantic information of service specifications using wordnet2.1 (a Semantic Lexicon database) and tags descriptive of web2.0. Matching is done on clusters on the description generated within WSDL file to get the desired service. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that out approach is more efficient and increases recall ratio towards matching services. Relevance feedback from the user for a specific query are captured which helps in cleansing a query.},

abstract={While collaborative tagging is attractive because of their easy and simple way to tag and search, tag based search suffers from no semantic descriptions for contents. Semantic Web technologies provide a new way to annotating and retrieving images. We address the problems of both folksonomy and semantic Web annotation systems for image retrieval in particular and argue that this can be improved by giving meanings to users' tags. This paper considers using both minimized domain-specific ontology and generic ontology. We show how less detailed ontologies can help end users to annotate and search with the simple user interface. Our prototype system has the capability to describe the semantics for contents of an image. Also, no previous extra work to create instances according to the ontology for later annotations is needed.},

abstract={In this paper, we measure and analyze the graph features of semantic Web (SW) schemas with focus on power-law degree distributions. Our main finding is that the majority of SW schemas with a significant number of properties (respectively, classes) approximate a power law for total-degree (respectively, the number of subsumed classes) distribution. Moreover, our analysis revealed some emerging conceptual modeling practices of SW schema developers: (1) each schema has a few focal classes that have been analyzed in detail (that is, they have numerous properties and subclasses), which are further connected with focal classes defined in other schemas, (2) class subsumption hierarchies are mostly unbalanced (that is, some branches are deep and heavy, while others are shallow and light), (3) most properties have as domain/range classes that are located high at the class subsumption hierarchies, and (4) the number of recursive/multiple properties is significant. The knowledge of these features is essential for guiding synthetic SW schema generation, which is an important step toward benchmarking SW repositories and query language implementations.},

year={2012},
pages={604-607},
abstract={Many software engineering tasks, such as feature location and duplicate bug report detection, leverages similarities among textual corpora. However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good.},

abstract={Personalized service recommendation becomes increasingly essential because of the growing number of services. To enhance the performance of personalized service recommendation in collaborative tagging systems, not only tag information but also time and social relations information should be considered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method aiming at taking advantage of tag, time and users' social relations information for a preferable service recommendation. We first improve a simple tag-based recommendation method by a time-decay function. Then we develop a temporal social-based recommendation method which analyzes user familiarity and user preference similarity between friends. Based on these two steps we integrate them as a temporal tag-and social-based (TTS) recommendation algorithm. Experiment results indicate that our method outperforms general tag-based and social-based recommendation methods.},

abstract={In recommender systems user preferences can be fairly dynamic, as users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users.},

year={2015},
pages={1770-1776},
abstract={With the permission of annotating blog posts with tags, tags has become one of the most important resources used to describe blogger features. However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

year={2013},
volume={15},

pages={1296-1303},
abstract={The great acceptation of the Social Web has converted social networks, blogs and wikis in almost perfect advertising mediums. However, many of the current social publicity strategies do not exploit all the potential of these mediums, since they obviate users' online life: the social contexts in which they are involved. Our proposal to reverse this situation is a model to infer users' social contexts by the application of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining techniques over users' interaction data on Facebook. We take advantage of both Facebook and Groupon APIs to provide a deployment scenario in which knowing users' social life allows ads to target the most potential customers, which is beneficial for both companies and possible customers.},

The objective of this paper is to map out a health research cluster in terms of an ontology. In this way, key relationships and informational exchanges can be captured and which enable more prudent use of critical knowledge assets within the cluster. We proffer an ontology based on our assessment of the healthcare space internationally and distillation of relevant extant literature.},

title={An Improved Similarity Measure Method in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm},
year={2013},
pages={297-303},
abstract={Collaborative filtering recommendation technology is successfully used in personalized recommendation services. Since the magnitudes of users and commodities in E-commerce system has increased dramatically, the user rating data in the entire item space become extremely sparse. There is a certain deviation while using traditional similarity measure methods, which reduces the recommendation accuracy for the recommendation systems. To overcome the shortages of the traditional similarity measures under such conditions, this paper proposes using similarity impact factor to improve similarity measures in collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. The experimental results show that the factor can effectively improve the similarity measure result while user rating data are extremely sparse, and significantly improve the accuracy of the recommendation systems.},

abstract={Q&A social media has gained a great deal of attention during recent years. People rely on these sites to obtain information due to the number of advantages they offer as compared to conventional sources of knowledge (e.g., asynchronous and convenient access). However, for the same question one may find highly contradictory answers, causing ambiguity with respect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/or non-expert users. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating the reliability and expertise of a user based on human cognitive traits. Every user can individually estimate these values based on local pairwise interactions. We examine the convergence performance of our algorithm and we find that it can accurately assess the reliability and the expertise of a user and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change.},

abstract={Several open and closed source repositories group software systems and libraries to allow members of particular organizations or the open source community to take advantage of them. However, to make this possible, it is necessary to have effective ways of searching and browsing the repositories. Software tagging is the process of assigning terms (i.e., tags or labels) to software assets in order to describe features and internal details, making the task of understanding software easier and potentially browsing and searching through a repository more effective. We present Sally, an automatic software tagging approach that is able to produce meaningful tags for Maven-based software projects by analyzing their bytecode and dependency relations without any special requirements from developers. We compared tags generated by Sally to the ones in two widely used online repositories, and the tags generated by a state-of-the-art categorization approach. The results suggest that Sally is able to generate expressive tags without relying on machine learning-based models.},

abstract={We examine the recent information visualization phenomenon known as tag clouds, which are an interesting combination of data visualization, web design element, and social marker. Using qualitative methods, we find evidence that those who use tag clouds do so primarily because they are perceived as having an inherently social or personal component, in that they suggest what a person or a group of people is doing or is interested in, and to some degree how that changes over time; they are visually dynamic and thus suggest activity; they are a compact alternative to a long list; they signal that a site has tags; and they are perceived as being fun, popular, and/or hip. The primary reasons people object to tag clouds are their visual aesthetics, their questionable usability, their popularity among certain design circles, and what is perceived as a bias towards popular ideas and the downgrading of alternative views.},

We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of reusing and integrating contents in different applications, like Websites, e-courses, collaborative portals, and new distribution channels, through the usage of friendly interfaces and intelligent techniques for reducing cataloguing effort. As a result, existing contents will be more accessible and enriched through its reuse and inclusion of internet resources.},

abstract={In this paper we present a study in which we explore the potential use of social tagging in providing access to large information systems. Tags are user-supplied access points for information resources, e.g., short labels that characterize pieces of information. As part of long- term research efforts to assess the usefulness of tags for retrieving content from large information spaces, we set up a first experiment in which we investigate the tags people assign to content. We chose a TV-guide that offers recommendations to users on interesting programs according to their tastes to be our case. Participants were asked to tag a number of TV programs. They were also asked to give a rating for the program. The results show a variety of tags. We composed a category scheme of these tags, which on a high level distinguishes between attitude tags, content tags, and self-reference tags. Tags that reflect the genre, the participant's opinion, and the program's characteristics were assigned most often. Surprisingly, no relationship was found between attitude tags and the rating participants have assigned to the program. We feel that the results can be generalized to other settings such as the field of document design and technical communication, including instructional texts.},

year={2015},
pages={75-79},
abstract={Recommendation is an important problem in the traditional field of data mining. As a consequence, various kinds of algorithms have been proposed in the last few years to improve the recommendation performance. However, many of them overlook users' rating behaviors. In this paper, an improved recommendation algorithm with considering users' habits and rating behaviors will be proposed. Firstly, calculate the ratings entropy for each user via users' rating records which can reflect users' behavioral features. Secondly, widely-used user-based method will be improved by considering rating entropy. Finally, the predicting rate is generated. Experimental results on the three datasets: Movie Lens, Netflix and RYM all suggest that the proposed method can enhance the algorithmic accuracy. Furthermore, since this method can improve those missing value more accurately via users' similarity and rating behaviors which might shed some light on discovering users' purchasing intention and optimizing the performance of recommender systems by human dynamics.},

abstract={Typical tasks of learning groups and knowledge workers include working both with printed and digital documents. We present a pen-based and tangible interaction concept for the linking and tagging of documents in a mixed physical and digital environment. The interaction with printed and electronic documents is unified. We therefore use digital pens, which equally capture physical handwriting on real paper and act as an input device on a specific screen prototype. Links and tags can have variable scopes ranging from small document passages to a collection of several documents. Physical folders along with camera-based marker tracking provide for the tangible definition of document collections. Tags are intuitively defined on a paper tag menu card. We present two visualizations of links and tags (a document-centered viewer and a hyperstructure-centered graph view). These are closely coupled with the physical environment.},

abstract={Real world applications of machine learning in natural language processing can span many different domains and usually require a huge effort for the annotation of domain specific training data. For this reason, domain adaptation techniques have gained a lot of attention in the last years. In order to derive an effective domain adaptation, a good feature representation across domains is crucial as well as the generalisation ability of the predictive model. In this paper we address the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classification by combining deep learning, for acquiring a cross-domain high-level feature representation, and ensemble methods, for reducing the cross-domain generalization error. The proposed adaptation framework has been evaluated on a benchmark dataset composed of reviews of four different Amazon category of products, significantly outperforming the state of the art methods.},

pages={85-85},
abstract={The ability to tag resources with uncontrolled metadata or "folksonomies" is often characterized as one of the central features of "Web 2.0" applications. Folksonomies are said to support emergent classification, where the semantic value of the tags and their relation to one another is worked out through a negotiated process of users applying their selected tags and seeing what others have tagged the same way. Few studies exist to show how folksonomic tagging is actually done, and to what extent users share each other's tagging patterns. In this paper, we present the results of a social network analysis of two months worth of tagging Internet video on the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. The analysis reveals that specific videos are tagged in fairly coherent ways by a relatively tight group of users. However, contrary to our expectations, there does not appear to be much re-use of tags across different content, or even very many users tagging more than a few similar items. Overwhelmingly, specific clusters of tags and users are associated with individual video links. This result suggests that tagging bookmarks is highly local, and the overall collection of tags is unlikely to result in a coherent globally navigable classification system},

To understand social tagging as a trigger for behavioral change, we explored the recent theoretical perspective of connectivism and connected knowledge. In connectivism connection making and sociality are key elements of knowledge work. Using this perspective we explore the realm of social tagging for knowledge workers.},

abstract={Social media have become a global phenomenon affecting people in their private lives and in their personal interactions, particularly among younger people. It is thus not surprising that social media are also being explored in professional contexts such as in large enterprises, where a number of social media platforms and social extensions to existing workgroup and collaboration systems have been emerging. In this paper, we consider one such platform that was developed for the internal use in a large global enterprise. We present data and their analysis for how this social media platform has been used in HP over the past five years. We then present conclusions from this analysis and relate them to work patterns in enterprises with the goal to better adapt social media platforms to the enterprise domain such that they better integrate with the work context people have as well as with IT systems that are used by them. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we present data and usage analysis of our social media platform over the past five years. Second, based on this analysis, we derive enhancements for social media platforms to better fit the work context and that can turn social media into a new generation of productivity platforms for the enterprise.},

abstract={Folksonomy systems and social bookmarking tools are rapidly spreading on the Web. Their steady increase reveals a more dynamic and interactive space, in which users can individually and freely share online resources and assign terms to them. In this paper, we address the problem of how to exploit these rich systems to enrich existing ontologies. Our approach taps into external tools such as the sense inventory WordNet to fix mistakes resulting from the free tagging and takes advantage from semantic relationships between tags to recognize resources' context. We carried out evaluations that mainly paid attention on the particularly challenging problem of resources' ambiguity to prove that not all resources shared in folksonomies are relevant resources for Dbpedia ontology. In this respect, it is worth of mention that our pre-processing step increases precision values to achieve an average precision of 80%.},

title={Unsupervised Software-Specific Morphological Forms Inference from Informal Discussions},
year={2017},
pages={450-461},
abstract={Informal discussions on social platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow) accumulates a large body of programming knowledge in natural language text. Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

abstract={Customer credit scoring is an important concern for numerous domestic and global industries. It is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance by traditional models constructed on the assumption that the training and test data are subject to the same distribution, because the customers usually come from different districts and may be subject to different distributions in reality. This study combines ensemble learning and transfer learning, and proposes a clustering and selecting based dynamic transfer ensemble (CSTE) model to transfer the related source domains to target domain for assisting in modeling. The experimental results in a large customer credit scoring dataset show that CSTE model outperforms two traditional credit scoring models, as well as three existing transfer learning models.},

abstract={Transfer learning aims to improve a targeted learning task using other related auxiliary learning tasks and data. Most current transfer-learning methods focus on scenarios where the auxiliary and the target learning tasks are very similar: either (some of) the auxiliary data can be directly used as training examples for the target task or the auxiliary and the target data share the same representation. However, in many cases the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks can be remote. Only a few features derived from the auxiliary data may be helpful for the target learning. We call such scenario the deep transfer-learning scenario and we introduce a novel transfer-learning method for deep transfer. Our method uses restricted Boltzmann machine to discover a set of hierarchical features from the auxiliary data. We then select from these features a subset that are helpful for the target learning, using a selection criterion based on the concept of kernel-target alignment. Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training. Our experiment results show that this transfer method is effective. It can improve classification accuracy by up to more than 10%, even when the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks is not apparent.},

title={Identify user variants based on user behavior on social media},
year={2015},
pages={1-8},
abstract={In social media, users are allowed to express their opinions by commenting on an item or rating an item with scores. The collection of user reviews would generate a positive or negative influence to the media audience. Some malicious users may create multiple variant accounts on the same social media so as to influence or manipulate public opinions for business or criminal purposes. To maintain good social environment, it is necessary to find those fake users. In this paper, we investigate the user variants identification problem using both user behavior and item related information. We study the characteristics of user behaviors on social media and introduce two concepts visibility and distingushibility to preliminarily quantify whether a fake user can be identified. To better understand user intention and characteristics, we profile a user with apparent and implicit features, which are extracted from three aspects: User Generated Contents (UGC), user behavior context and item information. Based on these features, we propose the user Variants Identification Problem (VIP) and an identification algorithm, which finds the top-k similar variants in a social media. We evaluate our methods against two real datasets MovieLens and Amazon and make comparison on the effectiveness against different features in identifying user variants.},

abstract={The number of digital lecture video recordings has increased dramatically since recording technology became easier to use. The accessibility and ability to search within this large archive are limited and difficult. Manual annotation is time-consuming and therefore useless. A promising approach is based on using the audio layer of a lecture recording to obtain semantic information about the lecture's contents. The speech transcript and the words from the power point slides are sufficient to generate semantic metadata serialized in an OWL file. Two annotation methods are discussed, evaluated and compared to each other and to a perfectly annotated OWL file, as well as to an annotation based on a corrected transcript of the lecture.},

abstract={Folksonomy systems enable users to participate in the Web content creation process by annotating (tagging) resources with freely chosen keywords. Still, it is an open issue how to exploit this user-created content, and how to process and use these emergent semantics effectively. We investigate how the context of Web resources can be utilized to improve recommended strategies in social tagging systems. We focus on the GroupMe! system, which enables users to create groups in order to bundle Web resources. GroupMe! groups form valuable context information for the resources contained in such groups. In this paper we exploit graph-based tag recommendation strategies, evaluate them in the GroupMe! dataset, and benchmark our results against other approaches. In our evaluations we show that graph-based strategies outperform other approaches, and show the immanent benefit of graph-based recommendation strategies which exploit the group context for recommending tags to untagged resources.},

Different countries with different cultures, variations in vocabulary and forms of expression, which can influence in their choice of tags while tagging images.

In this paper we present a study carried out for natives of different Spanish speaking countries, with the objective of providing user support depending on the detected language skills and characteristics of the user. Using the syntactic and semantic factors we can profile users in terms of their skill level and other characteristics, and then we can use these profiles to offer customized support for image tagging in the Spanish language.},

abstract={In this work, we study the task of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging systems. To include candidate tags beyond the existing vocabularies of the query resource and of the query user, we examine recommendation methods that are based on personomy translation, and propose a probabilistic framework for adopting translations from similar users (neighbors). We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

While these packages have improved over the years, they are still not very intuitive but more importantly they are not part of the practice of senior researchers in the field and many researchers who have tried to use this software without support have failed and given up. At the same time, the development of Web 2.0 tools has exploded in recent years. They are intuitive and free or low cost. There are many Web 2.0 tools that would support the analysis of qualitative data - in particular, collaborative analysis in teams. This paper will explore the benefits of using these tools as well as the challenges - especially, issues of privacy, ownership, and lack of affordances offered by current CAQDAS packages.},

In this paper, we analyzed such papers and collected different user representation models. Although there is no study which considers time parameter in user representation, we included the time parameter in one of the models. We evaluated the models for two social bookmarking website datasets by visualizing them as a graph with social network analysis, and by calculating f-measure scores for a tag recommendation system. As a result, tag property is considered as the best property to represent a user in such a website.},

abstract={Several studies demonstrate effectiveness and benefits of using user's social network information to enrich user's profile. In this context, one of our contributions [1] proposes an algorithm enabling to compute user's interests using information from egocentric network extracted communities. Therefore, mining information from a small or a sparse network remains challenging because there is not enough information to enrich a relevant user's profile. So, one of the main lock is to cope with the lack of information that is considered as an important issue to extract a relevant community and could lead to misinterpretations in the user's profile modeling process. We aim to improve the performance of [1], regarding the lack of information problem, in the case of a small and/or a sparse network. We propose to add more information (i.e. relations) into user's network before extracting the data and enriching his profile. To achieve this enrichment, we suggest using snowball sampling technique to identify and add user's distance-2 neighbors (friends of a friend) into the user's egocentric network. Our experimentation conducted in DBLP demonstrates the interest of node integration into small and sparse network. This leads to the study of link prediction that enables us to provide better performances and results compared to the existing work.},

The proposed software architecture comprises two components: a browser add-on, that catches direct or indirect user actions and a centralized database server that collects and aggregates data. We instantiated and tested our architecture by developing an application for collecting user emotional feedbacks during the visualization of videos on YouTube. The developed application is devoted to build up a large assessed database of emotional video stimuli labeled and rated by naive judges (the WWW users).},

abstract={The recent years have witnessed a rapid development in virtual reality technology and computer aided design, which accompanied by a vast amount of 3D content springing up from various domains, has given rise to an emerging need for methods by which they can be efficiently annotated before being searched and retrieved. In this paper a new approach to semantic annotation on 3D content is proposed. In this approach, much of the manual work on annotation is replaced with a semi-automatic process based on prior gathering of domain expertise. The geometric properties of objects and their spatial relationships are first automatically extracted and associated with a general ontology, the result of which is then matched against a set of user-defined rules to create annotations represented in an application ontology. The approach is Web3D oriented so that it can take advantage of features of X3D format. It will be shown using a prototype system how this approach can succeed in accelerating the annotation process.},

The human computation problems are the problems those computers are not good at solving but are trivial for humans. In this paper, we give a survey of various human computation systems which are categorized into initiatory human computation, distributed human computation and social game-based human computation with volunteers, paid engineers and online players. For the existing large number of social games, some previous works defined various types of social games, but the recent developed social games cannot be categorized based on the previous works. In this paper, we define the categories and the characteristics of social games which are suitable for all existing ones. Besides, we present a survey on the performance aspects of human computation system. This paper gives a better understanding on human computation system.},

year={2008},
pages={784-789},
abstract={Intelligent Service Robot (ISR) will grow to provide useful services for human as a need to support household chores and human function spreads and our community goes into an aging society. Self- reconfiguration of ISR is an important factor to change itself without stopping while supporting environment and technology change. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web 2.0 help us reduce integration expenses and increase reuse benefits. In this paper, we present a utilization of semantic Web 2.0 for self-reconfiguration of SOA based agent applications in ISR. The software architecture of ISR consists of service agents which are modules to provide information and knowledge. When ISR meets an irresolvable situation it searches and downloads a necessary service agent from the external service repository, executes the agent, and resolves the situation. The prototype implemented to show the situation has confirmed the validity of our study. Thus this study is expected to contribute to adding more intelligence to robots.},

abstract={With the widely usage of online social networks, people come to realize the necessity of making the social network more semantic. However, the lack of definition of connections hinders the fully applications of online social networks and transform them towards more semantic way. So in this paper, we try to overcome this problem by modeling the social tie connection in online social networks with an object-oriented approach based on extended RDF vocabulary. In our method, the connections are modeled as object entity, with attributes describing their content, and operations defining the legal manipulation upon them. The connections have inheritance relationships between them and thus form an inheritance tree. We presented our consideration in designing the object-oriented model of connection; and developed a prototype to show its advantages over the traditional approach.},

title={On the Navigability of Social Tagging Systems},
year={2010},
pages={161-168},
abstract={It is a widely held belief among designers of social tagging systems that tag clouds represent a useful tool for navigation. This is evident in, for example, the increasing number of tagging systems offering tag clouds for navigational purposes, which hints towards an implicit assumption that tag clouds support efficient navigation. In this paper, we examine and test this assumption from a network-theoretic perspective, and show that in many cases it does not hold. We first model navigation in tagging systems as a bipartite graph of tags and resources and then simulate the navigation process in such a graph. We use network-theoretic properties to analyse the navigability of three tagging datasets with regard to different user interface restrictions imposed by tag clouds. Our results confirm that tag resource networks have efficient navigation properties in theory, but they also show that popular user interface decisions (such as “pagination” combined with reverse-chronological listing of resources) significantly impair the potential of tag clouds as a useful tool for navigation. Based on our findings, we identify a number of avenues for further research and the design of novel tag cloud construction algorithms. Our work is relevant for researchers interested in navigability of emergent hypertext structures, and for engineers seeking to improve the navigability of social tagging systems.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering systems consider users' social environment to predict what each user may like to visit in a social network i.e. they collect and analyze a large amount of information on users' behavior, activities or preferences and then predict or make suggestions to users. These systems use ranks or tags each user assign to different resources to make predictions. Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents, tag, organize, share and search for contents, are becoming more popular. These social tagging systems have a lot of valuable information, but the data expansion in them is very fast and this has led to the need for recommender systems that will predict what each user may like or need make these suggestions to them. One of the problems in these systems is: “how much can we rely on the similar users, are they trustworthy?”. In this article we use trust metric, which we conclude from users' tagging behavior, beside similarities to give suggestions. Results show considering trust in a collaborative system can lead to better performance in generating suggestions.},

abstract={Affective or kansei design is a field of design engineering that concerns with designing emotionally pleasing products. One of the challenging issues in this area is to successfully understand customers' affective needs and to interpret it in terms of product design elements. Previous studies have attempted to obtain customer's affective needs using manual approaches, e.g. survey, which is time-consuming and a costly process. In relation, the study for such a need is usually limited to a number of product features only. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative tagging approach for discovering product features, affective description and their associations from product review analysis. Specifically, we have discussed on the tagging task assignment, tags aggregation and performance analysis of our proposal. A case study on discovering feature-affective associations from car reviews is reported to showcase the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract={These days VLSC (very large-scale conversation) is a particular type of online conversation, that is large scale, public, text-based, many-to-many and persistent. The nature of VLSC allows the accumulation of thousands of conversation in a fraction of time, and it often grows out of userspsila readable capacity. Therefore, extracting dominant public opinion on VLSC is usually impossible without causing an information overload. In this paper, Qtag is proposed to improve the VLSC environment by extracting public opinion easily, enhancing the value of conversation, and increasing the participantspsila willingness to engage. A simulation which mimics reality is built to create a VLSC environment, and two sets of questionnaire are conducted to compare userspsila experiences before and after Qtag trial.},

year={2009},

abstract={Webometrics is concerned with measuring aspects of the web: web sites, web pages, parts of web pages, words in web pages, hyperlinks, web search engine results. The importance of the web itself as a communication medium and for hosting an increasingly wide array of documents, from journal articles to holiday brochures, needs no introduction. Given this huge and easily accessible source of information, there are limitless possibilities for measuring or counting on a huge scale (e.g., the number of web sites, the number of web pages, the number of blogs) or on a smaller scale (e.g., the number of web sites in Ireland, the number of web pages in the CNN web site, the number of blogs mentioning Barack Obama before the 2008 presidential campaign). This book argues that it can be useful for social scientists to measure aspects of the web and explains how this can be achieved on both a small and large scale. The book is intended for social scientists with research topics that are wholly or p rtly online (e.g., social networks, news, political communication) and social scientists with offline research topics with an online reflection, even if this is not a core component (e.g., diaspora communities, consumer culture, linguistic change). The book is also intended for library and information science students in the belief that the knowledge and techniques described will be useful for them to guide and aid other social scientists in their research. In addition, the techniques and issues are all directly relevant to library and information science research problems.

pages={374-384},
abstract={With the wide application of Web_2.0 and social software, there are more and more tag-related studies and applications. Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

abstract={Social tagging systems provide users with the ability to share information and extend their field of knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to explore the tag relations of user interest in these systems and examine the semantic relations of tag usage in terms of user interests. To do this, a classifying method was used to characterize words into seven classes. Experiments were limited to the five areas of interests: music, photography, games, books and videos. Samples were taken from 50 English-language Web pages in the social bookmarking service Delicious. The top 7 tags were extracted from each Web page that was tagged as music, photography, games, books and videos. Via the results of the tag analysis of this study, relationship between tags and user interests were demonstrated. TagReel employed a radial visualization method, which has the advantage of giving an overview of the whole cluster of connection among tags. TagReel can represent the semantic concept of connection between tags and between interests. It can contribute to raising the cognitive power and awareness of tag usage in various categories and show the relative weight of tags.},

In this research, we focus on objects gathered on the Net, and our aim is the reconstruction of the tree of relevant information associated with them. For such objects, there are a lot of relevant information dispersed and stored somewhere on the Net, but it is not easy to retrieve such highly distributed information as a chain of related information.. In order to deal with such drawbacks, our approach is as follows. we extract automatically relevant keywords from the results of the first information retrieval, make the new query with such extracted keywords and do the search again. This process is repeated, and finally a knowledge tree of associated relevant information is constructed In this paper, we take as example the search of information associated with books. When the user search for a particular book, our system shows as complementary information the URL of related information recommended by other users in previous search for the same book title. Thus, our system automatically finds a query and searches the relevant information for a given subject.},

abstract={Tagging systems are particularly vulnerable to tag spam. Although some previous efforts aim to address this problem with detection-based or demotion-based approaches, tricky attacks launched by attackers who can exploit vulnerabilities of spam-resistant mechanisms are still able to invalidate those efforts. Therefore, it is challenging to resist tricky spam attacks in tagging systems. This paper proposes a novel spam-proof tagging system, which can provide high-quality tag search results even under tricky attacks, based on four key insights: demotion-based strategy, reputation, altruistic users and social networking. Specifically, our system upgrades/degrades the ranks of correct/incorrect content items in search results through introducing personalized users' reliability degrees and responsible users, thus avoiding clients pick unwanted content. Experimental results illustrated our system could effectively defend against tricky tag spam attacks and work better than current prevalent tag search models.},

abstract={Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach.},

However, automatic tools for learning information retrieval from these documents based on semantic tags are not yet effective. We propose here a model which aims at automatically annotating texts with semantic metadata. These metadata will allow us to index and extract learning objects from texts. This model is composed of two parts: the first part consists of a semantic annotation of learning objects according to their semantic categories (definition, example, exercise, etc.).

abstract={Designing personalized search engines based on a recommender system that takes into consideration the user situated moment in relation to the subject matter and the context that governs user interest has been largely ignored. In this paper, we present a novel approach to integrating user interests into search within a recommender system that is guided by the semantic representation of the user and the content. In addition, our research tackles two problems of creating any recommender system: (a) the initial stage problem (how to provide recommendations to a user if the system hasn't been used yet) and (b) user context (providing the same user with different recommendations based on the context of their recent activity). Also the design of our recommender system is modular. It integrates and accommodates user's preferences by using User Relevance Feedback. Finally, we describe how the personalization aspects can increase the recommendation quality.},

abstract={The profitability promoted by Google in its brand new video distribution platform YouTube has attracted an increasing number of users. However, such success has also attracted malicious users, which aim to self-promote their videos or disseminate viruses and malwares. Since YouTube offers limited tools for comment moderation, the spam volume is shockingly increasing which lead owners of famous channels to disable the comments section in their videos. Automatic comment spam filtering on YouTube is a challenge even for established classification methods, since the messages are very short and often rife with slangs, symbols and abbreviations. In this work, we have evaluated several top-performance classification techniques for such purpose. The statistical analysis of results indicate that, with 99.9% of confidence level, decision trees, logistic regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, random forests, linear and Gaussian SVMs are statistically equivalent. Based on this, we have also offered the TubeSpam - an accurate online system to filter comments posted on YouTube.},

abstract={A common problem of freely annotated or user contributed audio databases is the high variability of the labels, related to homonyms, synonyms, plurals, etc. Automatically re-labeling audio data based on audio similarity could offer a solution to this problem. This paper studies the relationship between audio and labels in a sound event database, by evaluating semantic similarity of labels of acoustically similar sound event instances. The assumption behind the study is that acoustically similar events are annotated with semantically similar labels. Indeed, for 43% of the tested data, there was at least one in ten acoustically nearest neighbors having a synonym as label, while the closest related term is on average one level higher or lower in the semantic hierarchy.},

year={2015},
volume={17},

pages={1359-1371},
abstract={The concept of “event” emerged in recent years as a key feature to efficiently index and retrieve media. Several approaches have been proposed to analyze the relationship between events and media, enable event discovery, and perform event-based media tagging, indexing, and retrieval. Despite the outstanding work done in this area, a major problem that remains open is how to infer the link between visual concepts and events. In particular, the possibility of understanding which perceptual elements allow a human recognizing the event depicted by an image would open new directions in event media discovery. In this paper we introduce the concept of event saliency to define the above event-revealing perceptual elements, and we propose an original method to detect it by exploiting crowd knowledge through gamification. We propose an adversarial game with a hidden purpose, where users are engaged in competitive roles: masking photos to prevent competitors recognizing the related event, and discovering events in photos masked by other players. Rules and incentives are defined to minimize cheating and force players to focus on details that really matter. A suitable algorithm composes the masks created by different players on the same media, thus producing a saliency map that, different from the traditional concept of saliency, does not focus on perceptual prominence but rather on event-related semantics of media. A thorough validation on public datasets is presented, and initial experiments to apply event saliency in detection tasks are proposed . Furthermore, an event-saliency dataset is disclosed to allow further research.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications innovate traditional informative services providing Web users with a set of tools for publishing and sharing information. Social bookmarking systems are an interesting example of this trend where users generate new contents. Unfortunately, the growing amount of available resources makes hard the task of accessing to relevant information in these environments. Recommender systems face this problem filtering relevant resources connected to users' interests and preferences. In particular, collaborative filtering recommender systems produce suggestions using the opinions of similar users, called the neighbors. The task of finding neighbors is difficult in environment such as social bookmarking systems, since bookmarked resources belong to different domains. In this paper we propose a methodology for partitioning users, tags and resources into domains of interest. Filtering tags and resources in accordance to the specific domains we can select a different set of neighbors for each domain, improving the accuracy of recommendations.},

pages={399-416},
abstract={With the increased presence of digital imaging devices, there also came an explosion in the amount of multimedia content available online. Users have transformed from passive consumers of media into content creators and have started organizing themselves in and around online communities. Flickr has more than 30 million users and over 3 billion photos, and many of them are tagged and public. One very important aspect in Flickr is the ability of users to organize in self-managed communities called groups. This paper examines an unexplored problem, which is jointly analyzing Flickr groups and users. We show that although users and groups are conceptually different, in practice they can be represented in a similar way via a bag-of-tags derived from their photos, which is amenable for probabilistic topic modeling. We then propose a probabilistic topic model representation learned in an unsupervised manner that allows the discovery of similar users and groups beyond direct tag-based strategies, and we demonstrate that higher-level information such as topics of interest are a viable alternative. On a dataset containing users of 10 000 Flickr groups and over 1 milion photos, we show how this common topic-based representation allows for a novel analysis of the groups-users Flickr ecosystem, which results into new insights about the structure of the entities in this social media source. We demonstrate novel practical applications of our topic-based representation, such as similarity-based exploration of entities, or single and multi-topic tag-based search, which address current limitations in the ways Flickr is used today.},

As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, automatically classifying music by genre is a challenging problem. The traditional approaches which solely depending on low-level audio features may not be able to obtain satisfactory results. In recent years, the social tags have emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the web. So, in this paper we propose a novel multi-modal music genre classification approach which uses the acoustic features and the social tags together for classifying music by genre. For the audio content-based classification, we design a new feature selection algorithm called IBFFS (Interaction Based Forward Feature Selection). This algorithm selects the features depending on the pre-computed rules which considering the interaction between the different features. In addition, we are interested in another aspect, that is how performing automatic music genre classification depending on the available tag data. Two classification methods based on the social tags (including music-tags and artist-tags) which crawled from website Last.fm are developed in our work: (1) we use the generative probabilistic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze the music-tags. Then, we can obtain the probability of every tag belonging to each music genre. (2) The starting point of the second method is that music's artist is often associated with music genres more closely. Therefore, we can compute the similarity between the artist-tag vector- to infer which genre the music belongs to. At last, our experimental results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-modal music genre classification approach.},

abstract={Internet users are shifting from searching on traditional media to social network platforms (SNPs) to retrieve up-to-date and valuable information. SNPs have two unique characteristics: frequent content update and small world phenomenon. However, existing works are not able to support these two features simultaneously. To address this problem, we develop a general framework to enable real time personalized top-k query. Our framework is based on a general ranking function that incorporates time freshness, social relevance and textual similarity. To ensure efficient update and query processing, there are two key challenges. The first is to design an index structure that is update-friendly while supporting instant query processing. The second is to efficiently compute the social relevance in a complex graph. To address these challenges, we first design a novel 3D cube inverted index to support efficient pruning on the three dimensions simultaneously. Then we devise a cube based threshold algorithm to retrieve the top-k results, and propose several pruning techniques to optimize the social distance computation, whose cost dominates the query processing. Furthermore, we optimize the 3D index via a hierarchical partition method to enhance our pruning on the social dimension. Extensive experimental results on two real world large datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of our proposed solution.},

abstract={Folksonomies are a widely used tool of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize Internet resources (Web 2.0). The process of annotation and tag management by users of social networks is extremely easy and simple; however, it involves serious problems of navigation and search unlike what happens with taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies. The use of fuzzy similarity measures allows the correct identification of syntactic variations when tag lengths are greater or equal than five symbols, been inadequate for smaller length tags. This article presents a method that combines both fuzzy similarity and cosine measures in order to provide a proper classification of tags even with smaller tag lengths. This method allows the proper classification of the 95% of the syntactic variations of tags analyzed in the experiments.},

title={Investigating the Collaborative Intention and Semantic Structure among Co-occurring Tags Using Graph Theory},
year={2012},
pages={190-195},
abstract={As the number of Web services dramatically increases, it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for user to find the desired Web services. Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between co-occurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results.},

An important and novel aspect of this approach is that our categorization method does not require a training set, which is in contrast to the traditional statistical and probabilistic methods. In the presented method, the ontology, including the domain concepts organized into hierarchies of categories and interconnected by relationships, as well as instances and connections among them, effectively becomes the classifier. Our method focuses on (i) converting a text document into a thematic graph of entities occurring in the document, (ii) ontological classification of the entities in the graph, and (iii) determining the overall categorization of the thematic graph, and as a result, the document itself. In the presented experiments, we used an RDF ontology constructed from the full English version of Wikipedia. Our experiments, conducted on corpora of Reuters news articles, showed that our training-less categorization method achieved a very good overall accuracy.},

There are two major problems, one is that there is a gap between the calculated results and the user's actual interests and is not able to find changes of users' preferences in time. The other problem is cold start.

abstract={The Twitter social network has become a target platform for both promoters and stammers to disseminate their target messages. There are a large number of campaigns containing coordinated spam or promoting accounts in Twitter, which are more harmful than the traditional methods, such as email spamming. Since traditional solutions mainly check individual accounts or messages, it is an urgent task to detect spam and promoting campaigns in Twitter. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework to detect both spam and promoting campaigns. Our framework consists of three steps: firstly linking accounts who post URLs for similar purposes, secondly extracting candidate campaigns which may exist for spam or promoting purpose and finally distinguishing their intents. One salient aspect of the framework is introducing a URL-driven estimation method to measure the similarity between accounts' purposes of posting URLs, the other one is proposing multiple features to distinguish the candidate campaigns based on a machine learning method. Over a large-scale dataset from Twitter, we can extract the actual campaigns with high precision and recall and distinguish the majority of the candidate campaigns correctly.},

abstract={Software tagging has been shown to be an efficient, lightweight social computing mechanism to improve different social and technical aspects of software development. Despite the importance of tags, there exists limited support for automatic tagging for software artifacts, especially during the evolutionary process of software development. We conducted an empirical study on IBM Jazz's repository and found that there are several missing tags in artifacts and more precise tags are desirable. This paper introduces a novel, accurate, automatic tagging recommendation tool that is able to take into account users' feedbacks on tags, and is very efficient in coping with software evolution. The core technique is an automatic tagging algorithm that is based on fuzzy set theory.

abstract={Online social and news media generate rich and timely information about real-world events of all kinds. However, the huge amount of data available, along with the breadth of the user base, requires a substantial effort of information filtering to successfully drill down to relevant topics and events. Trending topic detection is therefore a fundamental building block to monitor and summarize information originating from social sources. There are a wide variety of methods and variables and they greatly affect the quality of results. We compare six topic detection methods on three Twitter datasets related to major events, which differ in their time scale and topic churn rate. We observe how the nature of the event considered, the volume of activity over time, the sampling procedure and the pre-processing of the data all greatly affect the quality of detected topics, which also depends on the type of detection method used. We find that standard natural language processing techniques can perform well for social streams on very focused topics, but novel techniques designed to mine the temporal distribution of concepts are needed to handle more heterogeneous streams containing multiple stories evolving in parallel. One of the novel topic detection methods we propose, based on -grams cooccurrence and topic ranking, consistently achieves the best performance across all these conditions, thus being more reliable than other state-of-the-art techniques.},

Ever since 1994 when the Internet became available to the public and especially in 1995 when the World Wide Web put a usable face on the Internet, the Internet has become a platform of choice for a large number of ever-more sophisticated and innovative Web applications. In just one decade, the Web has evolved from being a repository of pages used primarily for accessing static, mostly scientific, information to a powerful platform for application development and deployment. New Web technologies, languages, and methodologies make it possible to create dynamic applications that represent a new model of cooperation and collaboration among large numbers of users. Web application development has been quick to adopt software engineering techniques of component orientation and standard components. For example, search, syndication, and tagging have become standard components of a new generation of collaborative applications and processes. Future developments in Web applications will be driven by advances in browser technology, Web Internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software engineering methods, and application trends.},

One example of such involvement is a process called tagging: users annotate digital items, called resources, with labels, called tags. Tags used for annotation represent users' categorization and perception of resources. As the result a network of interconnected resources and tags is created. Such a network is meant to simplify a search process for relevant content. The paper introduced the idea of constructing fuzzy sets based on the network of resources and tags. One of possible ways of building fuzzy representation of tags is proposed and described here. It is shown how those fuzzy sets can be used for search purposes.},

The Web 2.0 Toolbar combines the original Web 1.0 web page and additional Web 2.0 information together on the fly. Therefore, the website developers need not to rewrite their websites, and the users will be able to experience additional Web 2.0 functions.

We then carry out an experiment to investigate the tagging practices of 28 student analysts in vetting requirements-to-source-code trace matrices. Our study shows that tagging is readily adopted by analysts, tags produced in tracing follow power laws, and tags greatly enhance the precision of analyst-submitted final trace matrices.

abstract={Existing systems for automatic genre classification follows a supervised framework that extracts genre-specific information from manually-labeled music data and then identifies unknown music data. However, such systems may not be suitable for personal music management, because manually labeling music based on individually-defined genres can be labor intensive and subject to inconsistence from time to time. This work studies an unsupervised paradigm for music genre classification. It is aimed to partition a collection of unknown music recordings into several clusters such that each cluster contains recordings in only one genre, and different clusters represent different genres. This enables users to organize their personal music database without needing specific knowledge about genre. We investigate how to measure the genre similarities between music recordings and estimate the genre population size of a music collection. Our experiment results show the feasibility of clustering music recordings by genre.},

In this study, we propose a new model of flowable services. Its primary purpose is to realize seamless integration and provision of diverse services in an intuitive "flowable" way maximally close to the "flow" of users' activities and thoughts, and as pertinent as possible to their needs, thus gain the most satisfaction.

pages={369-376},
abstract={The Web services research community has proposed a number of approaches for service composition, ranging from manual to semi-automatic to completely automatic. However, it is often difficult to take independently developed services and compose them, since they may not work together correctly. For service composition to occur, the services in question must be designed and developed in a manner that facilitates their composition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for service design and composition that combines top-down and bottom-up elements. Our approach is driven by faceted, tag-based functional requirements provided by end-users. These requirements describe, at a high-level, the families of compositions that end-users desire. The requirements kick off a top-down service development lifecycle, where enterprise architects and service developers design, develop and test workflows and services, possibly reusing existing flows and services in the process. At runtime, end-users can specify goals, which are satisfied through a bottom-up composition of flows from the available services. The composed flows include those explicitly designed by the architects as well as new ones that are assembled in a serendipitous manner from the available services. With examples from a case study in the financial services domain, we demonstrate our approach for designing and developing services that can be composed into myriad workflows based on end-user goals.},

abstract={Tagging and social networks have come into increasing use in concert with the rise of collaborative and interactive on-line media. The focus of tagging is herein twofold: First of all the plain annotation of existing data by a governing instance in order to increase the semantic content of unstructured data, and secondly the application of such meta-information by a community or a group of like minded users. The information contained in such social tagging reflects the point of view and understanding of the community, presenting a valuable source of information for the discovery of community structure,content and intent. This paper proposes an approach aimed at the use of community based tagging to address problems in link prediction and the discovery of complex user groups in a fleeting and unstructured Web-based environment. The ideas presented in this paper are applied to a real world scenario, and the results show a distinct opportunity in community detection and support. This result will be incorporated into emerging knowledge management systems within Siemens AG in the near future.},

However, there are great collections of crisp ontologies developed so far in various domains which are not appropriate for decision making in fuzzy environment. Accordingly, this paper aims at presenting an approach to automatically convert a crisp ontology to fuzzy ontology in the context of social networks. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that the combination of a learning process of crisp ontology with proposed approach, decreases computational complexity of fuzzy ontology learning due to breaking the task to two optimal steps. Accordingly, the approach allows for an advantageous application of various crisp clustering techniques in fuzzy ontology context.},

abstract={Social media has long been a popular resource for sentiment analysis and data mining. In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.},

pages={274-277},
abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, such as Delicious1 and Flickr2, users are allowed to annotate resources (e.g., Web URLs and images) with textual descriptions called tags. Tags have proven to be invaluable building blocks in algorithms for searching, mining and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users, and as a result, most tags are added to the few highly-popular resources, while most of the resources receive few tags. Crucially, this incomplete tagging on resources can severely affect the effectiveness of all tagging applications. We present iTag, an incentive-based tagging system, which aims at improving tagging quality of resources, by incentivizing taggers under budget constraints. Our system is built upon traditional crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In our demonstration, we will show how our system allows users to use simple but powerful strategies to significantly improve the tagging quality of resources.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Analysis of a customer's sensibility and preferences is an important strategy in a market that is becoming increasingly more customer oriented. In this paper, we propose the sensibility ergonomics design recommendation system using weather WebBot (DRS-WB). The proposed method applies sensibility ergonomics to increase the efficiency of merchandising for human-oriented sensible product designs. Development of DRS-WB used a user interface and collaborative filtering for the textile and fashion designs in order to satisfy the user's needs. Collaborative filtering was adopted in order to recommend designs of interest for users based on the predictive relationship discovered between the current user and other previous users. The today weather information is simultaneously acquired from the sensor based smartwear and the weather WebBot (Web Robot Agent). The weather WebBot uses a database of weather forecast information extracted from the web pages and RSS of the Korea Meteorological Administration and collects information from the various links off the main URL. And its signals are transmitted to the connected DRS-WB. It can be easily monitored in real time. We used 60 textile designs and 41 fashion designs in the survey questionnaire. The composition of the questionnaire is 17 sections for 6 designs on a page. 2,830,020 ratings were collected from 1,401 users. The pictures of fashion design details, such as collar type, sleeve type, skirt type, skirt length, and color tone were evaluated in terms of sensibility. Ultimately, this paper suggests empirical applications to verify the adequacy and the validity of this system.},

The idea is to enable a greater degree of task automation and user support than is possible with the current Web. Yet the semantic Web has implications for knowledge publishing and access. An ontology-driven world might lead to the imposition of dominant conceptual viewpoints on formal knowledge production, which might threaten the democratic nature of knowledge publishing on the Web. However, the author argue that this won't necessarily happen, if we fully exploit the inherent flexibility and "smartness" associated with semantic technologies, and we succeed in connecting the semantic Web's construction process to the social dynamics shaping the current Web},

abstract={This book outlines the basic principles of creation and maintenance of taxonomies and thesauri. It also provides step by step instructions for building a taxonomy or thesaurus and discusses the various ways to get started on a taxonomy construction project. Often, the first step is to get management and budgetary approval, so I start this book with a discussion of reasons to embark on the taxonomy journey. From there I move on to a discussion of metadata and how taxonomies and metadata are related, and then consider how, where, and why taxonomies are used. Information architecture has its cornerstone in taxonomies and metadata. While a good discussion of information architecture is beyond the scope of this work, I do provide a brief discussion of the interrelationships among taxonomies, metadata, and information architecture. Moving on to the central focus of this book, I introduce the basics of taxonomies, including a definition of vocabulary control and why it is so important, how i dexing and tagging relate to taxonomies, a few of the types of tagging, and a definition and discussion of post- and pre-coordinate indexing. After that I present the concept of a hierarchical structure for vocabularies and discuss the differences among various kinds of controlled vocabularies, such as taxonomies, thesauri, authority files, and ontologies. Once you have a green light for your project, what is the next step? Here I present a few options for the first phase of taxonomy construction and then a more detailed discussion of metadata and markup languages. I believe that it is important to understand the markup languages (SGML and XML specifically, and HTML to a lesser extent) in relation to information structure, and how taxonomies and metadata feed into that structure. After that, I present the steps required to build a taxonomy, from defining the focus, collecting and organizing terms, analyzing your vocabulary for even coverage over subject areas, filling in gaps, creatin relationships between terms, and applying those terms to your content. Here I offer a cautionary note: don’t believe that your taxonomy is “done!” Regular, scheduled maintenance is an important—critical, really—component of taxonomy construction projects. After you’ve worked through the steps in this book, you will be ready to move on to integrating your taxonomy into the workflow of your organization. This is covered in Book 3 of this series.

pages={247-254},
abstract={Currently, for named entity disambiguation, the short-age of training data is a problem. This paper presents a novel method that overcomes this problem by automatically generating an annotated corpus based on a specific ontology. Then the corpus was enriched with new and informative features extracted from Wikipedia data. Moreover, rather than pursuing rule-based methods as in literature, we employ a machine learning model to not only disambiguate but also identify named entities. In addition, our method explores in details the use of a range of features extracted from texts, a given ontology, and Wikipedia data for disambiguation. This paper also systematically analyzes impacts of the features on disambiguation accuracy by varying their combinations for representing named entities. Empirical evaluation shows that, while the ontology provides basic features of named entities, Wikipedia is a fertile source for additional features to construct accurate and robust named entity disambiguation systems.},

abstract={Social bookmarking systems are used by millions of Web users to tag, save and share items. User-defined tags, however, are so variable in quality that searching on these tags alone is ineffective. One way to improve search in bookmarking systems is by adding more metadata to the user-defined tags to enhance tag quality. Such an approach would add value by incorporating information about the content of the resource while retaining the original user-defined tag. Tags automatically extracted from the resource could be the main source for tag enhancement. This paper describes how users' tags can be enhanced with metadata in the form of additional tags automatically extracted from the original document. An evaluation study shows how the enhanced tag set improved user searching in comparison to using only user-defined tags.},

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of the question labelling practices by contrasting the use of community generated tags in the Live QnA service with the use of topic categories from a fixed taxonomy in the Yahoo! Answers service. We found that community tagging is related to higher levels of social interactions amongst users. Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics. Thus, appropriate care needs to be taken when designing search, browsing, and recommender features for question discovery.},

With this process, social tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. Folksonomy are data created in social tagging. Tags in folksonomy reflect userspsila collaborative cognition on information. They can reveal both the userspsila behavior and resourcespsila properties. In this paper, we will study the vocabulary of userspsila tagging and the relationship between words. We connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a network of folksonomy, and investigate the semantic relatedness between tags within it. The result shows that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness, which is useful for designing future folksonomy-based systems.},

Knowledge discovery from this new genre is quite difficult and challenging as it is totally different from other popular genre of web-applications like World Wide Web (WWW).

abstract={Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing web pages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

abstract={Keywords or tags summarize documents on an abstract level and can also be used for describing code fragments. They might be leveraged for retrieving features of a software system, understanding program functionality, or providing additional context. While automatic approaches at best are only able to retrieve information that is already contained in the source code, manual tagging could add valuable extra information from qualified expertise of the developers. However, tagging code is tedious. To make code tagging more fun, we introduce a social gasification approach: developers independently tag code fragments and are rewarded if their solutions conform to the solution of other developers. We implemented the game as a Facebook plug-in. A pilot user study suggests that the game mechanics are motivating and promote the proposition of reasonable tags.},

abstract={In folksonomy, different users perform diverse tagging behaviors. Although many works have been reported on folksonomy based taxonomy construction, few attentions have been paid to the data preparation for the construction from the behavior perspective. To ensure constructing taxonomy with qualified folksonomy, a method is proposed in the paper to find representative tagging users, so called folksonomy experts, tending to perform representative tagging behaviors. The evaluation confirms that the proposed method is capable of finding folksonomy experts. The method proposed can be utilized to select qualified representative data for the existing folksonomy based taxonomy construction algorithms.},

title={Ontology Learning from User Tagging for Tag Recommendation Making},
year={2011},
volume={3},
pages={310-313},
abstract={Recently, user tagging systems have grown in popularity on the web. The tagging process is quite simple for ordinary users, which contributes to its popularity. However, free vocabulary has lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. It is possible to capture the semantics from user tagging into some form of ontology, but the application of the resulted ontology for recommendation making has not been that flourishing. In this paper we discuss our approach to learn domain ontology from user tagging information and apply the extracted tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment. The initial result shows that by using the tag ontology to re-rank the recommended tags, the accuracy of the tag recommendation can be improved.},

abstract={Although numerous studies have been conducted on learning resources recommendation in E-Learning, research extending this investigation into usage of users' contextual information is rare. This paper presents an innovative architecture of an intelligent personalized context-aware recommendation system in an E-Learning environment. The system offers users by recommending learning materials, tutors, or other learners with common interests combining users' social tags from external social network and tags about learning materials from autologous collaborative tagging system. A Rules Engine is used to manage a set of rules for each user to achieve personalized recommendation. The rules which define the relationship between tags construct the relationship graph model for users and learning resources thus graph-based collaborative filtering recommendation methods can be implemented. The rules will be adjusted depending on the user's feedbacks of previous recommendations.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have been largely adopted by users as useful and powerful tools to organize, browse and share interested resources on the web. All the tags used and resources collected by a user constitute the userpsilas personal tag space, which contains valuable information that can be used for building and enhancing the user model. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine user profile from onepsilas personal tag space. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model onepsilas personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We define several properties for each concept generated to evaluate the degree of such concept to depict the userpsilas interest, and then a novel algorithm is introduced to construct a hierarchical user profile from the built lattice. Experiments are carried out on the dataset collected from delicious and a detailed real-life case study is presented. Results show that the hierarchical user profile can describe the target userpsilas interests well enough, as well as organizing and browsing the tags and collocated resources effectively. Several research issues and technical details are discussed to further improve tag-based user profile for personalized services in the end.},

abstract={As an effective tool for unified representation of concepts, ontology has been applied to developing mechanisms for privacy protection to deal with problems caused by the heterogeneity of data. Although there are a lot of researches in the privacy related ontologies, but they have not been categorized and organized, making the current ontology related privacy protection research no clear line. We first propose a classification method to classifying the ontology used for privacy protection into three categories which are privacy ontology, personal ontology and social network ontology. We then classify the applications of ontology based privacy protection into five types and conduct a comparison analysis on the respective ontologies for the five types of applications. At last, we explicitly analyze the ontologies in terms of their relationships to privacy protection and point out some shortcomings in the current research as well as some future research directions.},

abstract={Tagging has become a common service on Web2.0 application. This kind of service allows users to share and annotate interesting web resources. CiteULike is an example of Web2.0 application that allows its users to share research papers based on their interest. It also allows the users to create annotations or tags attached to the research papers. This paper examined the use of tagging for research paper recommendation. A research paper recommendation mechanism based on tagging was proposed. This mechanism recommends a research paper according a set of tags they have created. The result suggested that tags created by each user could be used as a user individual profile. The profile then compared with research paper index to compute a similarity score. The result of experiment showed that the accuracy of the proposed research paper recommendation is 79% with f-measure value at 82%.},

At the micro level, the tag growth of popular resources in all three tagging systems follows a similar power-law distribution. Moreover, we find that the exponents of tag growth varied in different evolving stages of popular individual resources.},

Web services are being considered an excellent technology to solve distributed computing challenges in the Internet area. So now a days Web Service discovery is an essential element in Service-Oriented Computing. But selecting appropriate web services for the benefits of service consumers is a key issue in service discovery. Web service discovery is based on service functionality and QoS. However, without Web service quality standards and quality-based discovery mechanisms, the trustworthiness of business-to-business interactions can't be guaranteed. Web service discovery spread up into these areas like agent, ontology, semantic, context server. But even though number of techniques, methods proposed for web service is always been a question. We have wide rage of QoS parameters but it is not easy to select the best one. So we are analyzing the QoS parameters and selecting the best service according to the user request. For better decision making the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multiple criteria decision making method, is applied as an underlying mechanism for developing a flexible and effective ranking algorithm.},

volume={46},

pages={908-920},
abstract={The user-generated content (UGC) is a type of dyadic information that provides description of the interaction between users and items (such as rating, purchasing, etc.). Most conventional methods incorporate either a user profile or the item description, which cannot well utilize this kind of content information. Some other works jointly consider user ratings and reviews, but they are based on the factorization technique and have difficulty in providing explanations on generated recommendations. In this study, a coupled topic model (CoTM) for recommendation with UGC is developed. By combining UGC and ratings, the method discussed in this study captures both the content-based preferences and collaborative preferences and, thus, can explain both the user and item latent spaces using the topics discovered from the UGC. The learned topics in CoTM can also serve as proper explanations for the generated recommendations. Experimental results show that the proposed CoTM model yields significant improvements over the compared competitive methods on two typical datasets, that is, MovieLens-10M and Citation-network V1. The topics discovered by CoTM can be used not only to illustrate the topic distributions of users and items, but also to explain the generated user-item recommendations.},

abstract={With the increasing number of Web services available on the Internet, how to recommend Web services to interested users effectively and efficiently remains to be a big challenge. At present, collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used technique in the design of recommender systems to handle information overload. For Web services, however, it is difficult for user to collect personalized QoS (Quality of Service)data and other explicit feedbacks such as ratings. In most cases, only a part of the implicit feedbacks (e.g., watchlist) is available in service registry. In this paper, we leverage implicit feedback from user's watchlist to build a CF-based recommender system for Web service. Our main contribution is to transform implicit feedbacks into explicit ratings to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. More specifically, we first construct binary user-service rating matrix according to the implicit feedback from the watchlist. Then, temporal and tag preference are combined into the original rating matrix to generate a more accurate pseudo rating matrix, which can reflect users' different preference on services in their own watchlists. Finally, we use traditional user-based CF method to produce a personalized service recommendation list with corresponding pseudo ratings.

pages={1909-1913},
abstract={Rating Prediction is a key problem in recommendation system, especially in Bigdata environment with data sparsity. Recently, Factorization Machine (FM) has been proven to be effective in solving the recommendation problem. Whereas, valuable category information of users and items are neglected in basic FM model. In this paper, we fully explore the capabilities of category information to improve the accuracy of rating prediction, and proposed a Category Weight Factorization Machine (CW-FM) based on FM. CW-FM utilizes hierarchical category information to avoid the interaction between feature vectors which have the subordinate relations. Combined with user and item category information, CW-FM is proven to be an effective solutions to reducing the rating error in recommendation systems. The proposed CW-FM is evaluated by extensive experiments with real world datasets. Results show that CW-FM model achieves better iterative efficiency and higher rating accuracy compared to contemporary schemes.},

abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet technology and digital media technology, information dissemination has entered the era of media integration. Meanwhile, the support of big data technologies promotes the deep integration of traditional media and new media. The media industry is undergoing profound changes. The management and dissemination of news are not only faced with opportunities, but also faced many challenges. How to push the news and customized content to users timely and dynamically, so as to save the searching time, becomes a hot area of current research. A news correlation approach based on tags is proposed to provide users with a personalized news service. The system takes advantage of the network information crawling, web-based text mining and personalized recommendations technologies to realize automated extraction of news tag. The innovation of this mode is that the tag contains both categories and keywords. It contains a classification subject to the advantage of clustering, but also includes the theme of keywords intuitive expression. In other words, it matches the user's search habits. Thus, this system can improve the ability to retrieve and manage the news.},

abstract={In this research, we propose a methodology for ontology construction and evolution using tags from tag-cloud to improve availability of analysis and utilization of large scale of data. It is possible to construct semantic relationships among tags. To do this, one way of building of relationships among tags is use of a popularized tag as a thing of ontology. However, it is not easy to select the popularized tag from tag cloud and to build a complete ontology with all of tags in the tag-cloud because tags are timely and dynamically updated added with tremendous numbers of tags. Therefore, we construct Primitive Ontologies (POs). A general tag is used to as a thing of a PO. The general tag is matched into one of requested keywords by users. In addition, we propose a methodology to evolve ontology using tags. To construct and evolve a PO, it defines classes and relationships between given tags by a user. Finally, the constructed several POs are integrated into a Tag-Based integrated Semantic ontology (TBiSont) by building relationships between classes that are included in each different PO. The construction of relationships among tags depends on linked resources into tags. The properties of tags are usually characterized by linked resources. It causes to extract semantic relationships among tags, because tags are comprised of meta-information that represents properties of resources. Thereby, the proposed PO is constructed by a general tag as a best-referring tag and relationships among tags including the general tag. The TBiSont as an integration of POs was applied into data analysis and a search process to verify efficiency of as in application systems. When we applied TBiSont into searching, it shows that TBiSont is more efficient than the other statistical-based search systems to increase accuracy or diversity of search results.},

pages={413-416},
abstract={We propose the Tag Allocation Model (TAM) to model social annotation data. TAM is a probabilistic generative model, its key feature is finding the latent reason for each tag. A latent reason can be any discrete features of the document (such as words) or a global noise variable. Inferring the reason for each tag helps TAM reduce the ambiguity of a document with multiple tags. By introducing noise as a reason, TAM can handle noise tags naturally. We perform experiments on three real world data sets. The results show that TAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both held-out perplexity and tag recommendation accuracy.},

abstract={As a necessary part of our daily life, choose what dishes to cook that is a problem and troubles many people every day. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of multimedia recipe data on the Web 2.0 communities. To assist people to navigate and search on from large amounts of recipes, a suitable recipe model is crucial and indispensable. However, recipes have some distinct characteristics that conventional data models are inadequate to represent them for such data. For example, it is unreasonable and insufficient to measure how similar the cooking procedures of two dishes are only through text descriptions and/or their extracted terms. The main reason is that this raw data (or low-level features extracted from the raw data, e.g. term for text, color for image) do not map to the high-level semantics readily. In this paper, we argue that a recipe model should be semantic-based and behavior-oriented, preferably with domain knowledge support. A hybrid semantic item (HSI) model is next presented for addressing this problem. Based on HSI model, we devise a corresponding approach for recipe search by example. The experiment on our multimedia recipe retrieval system demonstrates that our HSI approach outperforms baseline methods.},

abstract={Content Based Multimedia Retrieval on non-textual documents is often constrained by available metadata. User-generated tags constitute an important source of information about a resource. To enable search scenarios exceeding traditional text-based search, such as exploratory and semantic search, this textual information must be complemented with semantic entities. Due to tag ambiguities and creative neologisms automatic semantic annotation based on user tags represents a major challenge. In this work, we show how to adopt context information and ontological knowledge to automatically assign semantic entities to user-generated tags for video data. Thus, a sophisticated semantic search on semantic entities is enabled. The algorithm combines co-occurence and link graph analysis using Linked Data. Also, a definition of context reliability in audio-visual content is described.},

abstract={Recommender system plays a significant role in reducing the information overload on the sites where users have searched and contented. Existing approaches which deals with such recommendation system apply collaborative filtering techniques to specify the most alike users whom they hope to make recommendations. Collaborative Filtering will significantly show better improvement with the enclosure of real data extraction from the suitable tagging system. In this paper, data from social tagging systems are extracted for every individual considering the correlations between users, items, and tag information. Tag information from users is the most decisive factor to predict the personalized suggestion for web users. Here, we rank the available content based tag information with the inclusion of temporal decay of users' behavior over time and the centrality of every node in the network. Finally, we use the common preference metric for effective personalization. Results have been experimentally demonstrated with the empirical dataset MovieLens and provided the results as an alternative recommendation method with simplicity and efficiency.},

title={Randomized tag recommendation in social networks and classification of spam posts},
year={2010},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Tag recommendation is an integral part of any bookmarking application. With the growing popularity in Web 2.0 usage, recommending tags is of utmost importance in enabling a user to perform bookmarking easily. An issue that most recommendation systems do not consider is that users have a tendency to choose from tags that are suggested to them, which might bias the true popular rankings of tags. In this paper we consider the problem of tag recommendation for bookmarks based on user feedback. We propose an approach for automatic tag recommendation by using a suggestion set and discuss a randomized suggestion rule for learning the true popular tags. As our algorithm depends on the frequency of tag suggestions, the action of spammers and malicious users may result in skewed ranking of tags for a bookmark. Hence, there arises a need to identify malicious users and spam posts to reinforce the efficiency of our algorithm because spammers can easily mislead a system. We have proposed an approach for classifying spammers based on tagging history of users. Our approach basically estimates the probability of a user being a spammer by analyzing previous posts and tags. Our analysis on a dataset of a popular bookmarking site shows that the proposed method is effective in suggesting the true popular tags and identifying spammers.},

abstract={Recent technological advancements have led to a deluge of data from distinctive domains (e.g., health care and scientific sensors, user-generated data, Internet and financial companies, and supply chain systems) over the past two decades. The term big data was coined to capture the meaning of this emerging trend. In addition to its sheer volume, big data also exhibits other unique characteristics as compared with traditional data. For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions. First, we present the definition of big data and discuss big data challenges. Next, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data systems into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics. These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities. In addition, we present the prevalent Hadoop framework for addressing big data challenges. Finally, we outline several evaluation benchmarks and potential research directions for big data systems.},

abstract={As more web services are offered on the Web, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to manage and search for online content, using only flat keyword searching. Users often forget how they tagged their data but may remember generic information such as the location they were in when they took the picture. We describe a framework for personalized context-aware search of ontology-based tagged data. The tag ontology leverages additional information on data coming from a user and a resource, besides the tagged keyword, in order to augment search information. The framework uses general concepts taken from PeCMan, a personal content manager and GloServ, an ontology-based global service discovery system to implement the front-end and back-end of the overall system.},

abstract={Reporting bugs, asking for new features and in general giving any kind of feedback is a common way to contribute to an Open-Source Software (OSS) project. This feedback is generally reported in the form of new issues for the project, managed by the so-called issue-trackers. One of the features provided by most issue-trackers is the possibility to define a set of labels/tags to classify the issues and, at least in theory, facilitate their management. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to confirm that taking the time to categorize new issues has indeed a beneficial impact on the project evolution. In this paper we analyze a population of more than three million of GitHub projects and give some insights on how labels are used in them. Our preliminary results reveal that, even if the label mechanism is scarcely used, using labels favors the resolution of issues. Our analysis also suggests that not all projects use labels in the same way (e.g., for some labels are only a way to prioritize the project while others use them to signal their temporal evolution as they move along in the development workflow). Further research is needed to precisely characterize these label “families” and learn more the ideal application scenarios for each of them.},

abstract={In science, gene provides the instruction for making proteins, while meme is the sociocultural equivalent of a gene containing instructions for carrying out behavior. Taking inspiration from nature, we model the memeplex in search as instructions that specify the coadapted meme complexes of individuals in their lifetime. In particular, this paper presents a study on the conceptual modeling of meme complexes or memeplexes for more effective problem solving in the context of modern stochastic optimization. The memeplex representation, credit assignment criteria for meme coadaptation, and the role of emergent memeplexes in the lifetime learning process of a memetic algorithm in search are presented. A coadapted memetic algorithm that takes the proposed conceptual modeling of memeplexes into actions to solve capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs) of diverse characteristics is then designed. Results showed that adaptive memeplexes provide a means of creating highly robust, self-configuring, and scalable algorithms, thus generating improved or competitive results when benchmarking against several existing adaptive or human-designed state-of-the-art memetic algorithms and metaheuristics, on a plethora of CVRP sets considered.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of automatically extracting perceptive information from acoustic signals, in a supervised classification context. Global labels, i.e., atomic information describing a music title in its entirety, such as its genre, mood, main instruments, or type of vocals, are entered by humans. Classifiers are trained to map audio features to these labels. However, the performances of these classifiers on individual labels are rarely satisfactory. In the case we have to predict several labels simultaneously, we introduce a correction scheme to improve these performances. In this scheme-an instance of the classifier fusion paradigm-an extra layer of classifiers is built to exploit redundancies between labels and correct some of the errors coming from the individual acoustic classifiers. We describe a series of experiments aiming at validating this approach on a large-scale database of music and metadata (about 30 000 titles and 600 labels per title). The experiments show that the approach brings statistically significant improvements.},

abstract={Social tagging has become popular around the Internet as well as in research. The main idea behind tagging is to allow users to provide metadata to the web content from their perspective to facilitate categorization and retrieval. There are many factors that influence users' tag choice. Many studies have been conducted to reveal these factors by analysing tagging data. This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging.},

pages={392-397},
abstract={New developments in the collaborative and participatory role of Web has emerged new web based fast lane information systems like tagging and bookmarking applications. Same authors have shown elsewhere, that for same papers tags and bookmarks appear and gain volume very quickly in time as compared to citations and also hold good correlation with the citations. Studying the rank prediction models based on these systems gives advantage of gaining quick insight and localizing the highly productive and diffusible knowledge very early in time. This shows that it may be interesting to model the citation rank of a paper within the scope of a conference or journal issue, based on the bookmark counts (i-e count representing how many researchers have shown interest in a publication.) We used linear regression model for predicting citation ranks and compared both predicted citation rank models of bookmark counts and coauthor network counts for the papers of WWW06 conference. The results show that the rank prediction model based on bookmark counts is far better than the one based on coauthor network with mean absolute error for the first limited to the range of 5 and mean absolute error for second model above 18. Along with this we also compared the two bookmark prediction models out of which one was based on total citations rank as a dependent variable and the other was based on the adjusted citation rank. The citation rank was adjusted after subtracting the self and coauthor citations from total citations. The comparison reveals a significant improvement in the model and correlation after adjusting the citation rank. This may be interpreted that the bookmarking mechanisms represents the phenomenon similar to global discovery of a publication. While in the coauthor nets the papers are communicated personally and this communication or selection may not be captured within the bookmarking systems.},

abstract={We propose a novel approach to the problem of expertise mining in an enterprise, taking advantage of online social applications deployed within the enterprise. Based on the assumption that the userspsila interactions with such social software reflect to some extent their expertise, we devise a probabilistic method for identifying the main areas of expertise of users based solely on their set of tags extracted from a social bookmarking system. We base our approach on statistical language models, which we adapt to fit our unique setting. We train and validate our model on a real world dataset extracted from two IBM-internal applications. Our results show that our approach provides a viable alternative to other methods that rely on documents extracted from the enterprise corpora.},

title={Web services for supporting the interactions of learners in the Social Web},
year={2010},
pages={128-133},
abstract={Web communication technologies such as instant messaging (chat) and discussion forums have been widely used by learners and people involved in different communities of practice (CoP) in the last few years. With the advent of the Social Web (that is part of Web 2.0), learners have been able to interact and share, exchange, comment and grade resources within their learning community in new ways, especially by using social networking websites and folksonomies. Thus, at this moment learners and members of CoP are connected with their peers and share resources of common interest on different social networking sites and they communicate using technologies such as chats and forums. The main problem is that there is a scarcity of tools designed to analyze and support learners in this new context. In this context, we propose a set of tools that are intended to support learners interacting using chat, forum and social networking platforms. Although the two services are decoupled, they can be used in a coherent scenario as the want proposed in this paper.},

abstract={Image browsing has become an indispensable feature for today's mobile devices. To overcome their limited display size, information systems may benefit from the abundant clickstream provided by mobile users. This implicit feedback turns out to be very informative providing hints on both the visual image content and the relevance of the query results when searching for images. Building on previous works on user attention models, we propose a practical, yet generic platform for web usage tracking. Implicit feedback from the clickstream makes it possible to generate visual attention metadata. These metadata are user interest maps (UIMs) in which regions of interest (ROIs) become highlighted. These UIMs are used to establish and reinforce keyword-to-image relations. A tentative application for semantic annotation is also presented.},

abstract={Relevance is one of the most interesting topics in the information retrieval domain. In this paper, we introduce another method of relevance calculation. We propose to use the implicit opinion of users to calculate relevance. The Implicit judgment of users is injected to the documents by calculating different kinds of weighting. These latter touch several criteria like as user's weight in the query's words, user's profile, user's interest, document's content and the document popularity. In this method, each user is an active element of the system, he searches documents and he makes treatments to provide relevant information to other users in the Network. This is similar as the peer-to-peer systems; unlike that, an element (user) have to manage automatically his data by creating a short view model of his most visited documents, and calculates his relative relevance about each one. The relative relevance is variable according each user, so the final relevance is calculated by the averaging of the elementary relevance of all users. Hence, the name of collaborative relevance.},

pages={356-366},
abstract={Understanding the technology landscape is crucial for the success of the software-engineering project or organization. However, it can be difficult, even for experienced developers, due to the proliferation of similar technologies, the complex and often implicit dependencies among technologies, and the rapid development in which technology landscape evolves. Developers currently rely on online documents such as tutorials and blogs to find out best available technologies, technology correlations, and technology trends. Although helpful, online documents often lack objective, consistent summary of the technology landscape. In this paper, we present the TechLand system for assisting technology landscape inquiries with categorical, relational and trending knowledge of technologies that is aggregated from millions of Stack Overflow questions mentioning the relevant technologies. We implement the TechLand system and evaluate the usefulness of the system against the community answers to 100 technology questions on Stack Overflow and by field deployment and a lab study.

year={2017},
pages={30-39},
abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with modern sensors and sensor-based devices, will significantly stimulate the development of context-aware applications. An effective means to extract higher-level contextual information from sensor data is distributed complex event processing (CEP), which facilitates the analysis of real-time data streams coming from heterogeneous and distributed sources. Considering that user context is inherently sensitive information, the preservation of privacy is critical once the processing of user context takes place over several (possibly malicious) devices, especially in collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a trust-based approach for the placement and execution of CEP operators in a distributed environment. We propose a trust management model based on communication interactions among the users. Furthermore, we incorporate trust recommendations using a cosine-based similarity check in order to overcome collusion and on-off attacks. We developed a smartphone-based distributed CEP system called TrustCEP to evaluate our approach for trust management. Based on the evaluation of TrustCEP, we observe that our approach induces a minimal increase in average battery consumption compared to privacy-negligent approaches.},

title={Automated construction of a software-specific word similarity database},
year={2014},
pages={44-53},
abstract={Many automated software engineering approaches, including code search, bug report categorization, and duplicate bug report detection, measure similarities between two documents by analyzing natural language contents. Often different words are used to express the same meaning and thus measuring similarities using exact matching of words is insufficient. To solve this problem, past studies have shown the need to measure the similarities between pairs of words. To meet this need, the natural language processing community has built WordNet which is a manually constructed lexical database that records semantic relations among words and can be used to measure how similar two words are. However, WordNet is a general purpose resource, and often does not contain software-specific words. Also, the meanings of words in WordNet are often different than when they are used in software engineering context. Thus, there is a need for a software-specific WordNet-like resource that can measure similarities of words. In this work, we propose an automated approach that builds a software-specific WordNet like resource, named WordSimSEDB, by leveraging the textual contents of posts in StackOverflow. Our approach measures the similarity of words by computing the similarities of the weighted co-occurrences of these words with three types of words in the textual corpus. We have evaluated our approach on a set of software-specific words and compared our approach with an existing WordNet-based technique (WordNetres) to return top-k most similar words. Human judges are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two techniques. We find that WordNetres returns no result for 55 % of the queries. For the remaining queries, WordNetres returns significantly poorer results.},

pages={525-531},
abstract={Focused crawlers selectively retrieve Web documents that are relevant to a predefined set of topics. To intelligently make predictions and decisions about relevant URLs and web pages, different topic models have been introduced to represent topic-specific knowledge. Yet it is difficult to support semantic interoperability among different models. Moreover, some manually specified additional semantic information, such as semantic markups and social annotations, could not be effectively used to improve crawling. This paper proposes to boost focused crawling with four kinds of semantic models and semantic information, including thesauruses, categories, ontologies, and folksonomies. A statistical semantic association model is proposed to integrate different semantic models, represent heterogeneous semantic information, and support semantic relevance computation. A focused crawling framework is developed which adopts both keyword based contents and different kinds of additional information for relevance prediction and ranking. Experiments show that the proposed model and framework effectively integrates heterogeneous semantic information for focused crawling.},

abstract={A huge amount of data and metadata emerges from Web 2.0 applications which have transformed the Web to a mass social interaction and collaboration medium. Collaborative tagging systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

pages={944-947},
abstract={Tagging is a process whereby users freely choose keywords to label Web objects in order to share or recover them later. Tags associated to an object by the user depict his viewpoint or perception. The perception of the target user can be enhanced by aggregating and analyzing the tags associated to an object by other users who share at least one tag with the target user in common for that object and recommending tags to him. Most of the existing techniques recommend tags on the basis of their popularity among the users. The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes. To observe the performance of our approach, experiments are carried out on the data collected from delicious, a social book marking site that allows the users to tag URLs and share them with other people.},

abstract={With the growing popularity of Web services, an increasing number of Web services have been integrated into and used by complex service oriented systems. As a result, the management of Web services has gained more importance as Web services management systems can provide useful service information to service consumers, developers and providers. However, current Web service management systems do not provide a holistic view of Web services. These management systems use independent information models covering different aspects of Web services, for instance, QoS, licensing, taxonomy information, to name just a few. In this paper, we address the challenges of (1) integrating available information into a common Web service information model, while (2) providing an extensible information model, and at the same time, (3) keeping track of Web services changes and (4) offering means for complex analysis of Web services. We introduce a Service Evolution Management Framework (SEMF) that addresses the aforementioned challenges using a generic Web service information model. We illustrate how we utilize our proposed Web service information model to manage changes of Web services, and present a case study that shows how our framework could be used in practice.},

year={2014},
pages={440-443},
abstract={Every user has an individual background and a particular aim while searching the information or images on the Web. The goal of Web search personalization is to retrievce the search results to a particular user depends on that user's preferences. These data allows the users not only to facilitate and share the data, but to afford information and improve media retrieval and management. One such examples is personalized image retrieval where user's explicit information is considered to produce exact images using re-ranking results. In this paper, the Tag-Annotation based approach by Re-ranking (TAD-RR) is proposed to generate personalized images. The basic assertion is to collect the images from the user and store it in a database with appropriate tag and annotation. Thereby, semantic search is developed to compare the query with dictionary to find out the relevant tag name. The images are then found from the database by applying TAD-RR procedures. Finally, page refreshing is handled at the time of image downloading. If a particular image is downloaded, the demand will be increased for that image in the server and the page gets reloaded based on the retrieved image annotation by ranking similarly. The experimental results show that the proposed approach accurately retrieves the personalized images.},

abstract={Collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary became valuable lexical semantic resources with a high influence in diverse Natural Language Processing tasks. Although Arabic collaborative knowledge bases are in general poorly informatized and significantly different from traditional linguistic knowledge bases in various respects. Aljazeera.net is professionally edited and has rich semantic structure. It constitutes an asset, an impediment and a challenge for research in Arabic Natural Language Processing. This paper addresses one such major impediment, namely the lack of suitable tools to access the knowledge stored in these large semantic knowledge bases. We present a framework designed for mining the explicit and implicit lexical semantic information impeded in the structure and the content of Aljazeera.net. Furthermore, it provides an efficient and structured access to the resulted semantic graph. This framework will be freely available for research purposes to meet the needs of Arabic Natural Language Processing community.},

title={Community-based user domain model collaborative recommendation algorithm},
year={2013},
volume={18},
number={4},
pages={353-359},
abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O(n).},

year={2012},
volume={1},
pages={292-296},
abstract={Content-based social tagging recommendation, which considers the relationship between the tags and the descriptions contained in resources, is proposed to remedy the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering. There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

title={Enrichment of ontology by exploiting collaborative tagging systems: A contextual semantic approach},
year={2016},
pages={1-6},
abstract={The scale of the social web has integrated users in order to organize shared resources. Users freely associate keywords (tags) to resources. This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems.},

We collected a data set of Web pages that includes both social tags from the del.icio.us website and author-provided metadata crawled from the internet. Based on this data set, we first checked the overlap of user-created tags and author-provided metadata with the title and content of the annotated web pages. Then, we experimented on two clustering methods based on tags and author-provided metadata. The results show that both tags and author-provided metadata add valuable information to existing page content and that social tags are more effective than author-created metadata for enhancing web clustering performance either as an independent information source or as links connecting topically related pages.},

abstract={Recommender systems have emerged as an essential response to the rapidly growing digital information phenomenon in which users are finding it more and more difficult to locate the right information at the right time. Systems under Web2.0 allow users not only to give resources- ratings but also to assign tags to them. Tags play a significant role in Web 2.0. They can be used for navigation, browsing, recommendation and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, which is based on social networks. The social network is established among users and items, taking into account both the information of ratings and tags. We consider users' co-tagging behaviors and add the similarity relationship to the graph to enhance the performance. Our algorithm is based on the Random Walk with Restarts but provides a more natural and efficient way to represent social networks. Having considered the influence of tags, the transition matrix is denser and the recommendation is more accurate. By evaluating our new algorithm and comparing it to the baseline algorithm which is used in many real world recommender systems on a real life dataset, we make the conclusion that our method performs better than the baseline method.},

abstract={Online communities have recently become a popular tool for publishing and searching content, as well as for finding and connecting to other users that share common interests. The content is typically user-generated and includes, for example, personal blogs, bookmarks, and digital photos. A particularly intriguing type of content is user-generated annotations (tags) for content items, as these concise string descriptions allow for reasonings about the interests of the user who created the content, but also about the user who generated the annotations. This paper presents a framework to cast the different entities of such networks into a unified graph model representing the mutual relationships of users, content, and tags. It derives scoring functions for each of the entities and relations. We have performed an experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets (crawled from deli.cio.us and Flickr) where manual user assessments of the query result quality show that our unified graph framework delivers high-quality results on social networks.},

A central repository acts as an information overlay on top of other pre-existing resources to facilitate organization, navigation, annotation and meta-analysis while maintaining synchronization with those resources. An initial population of the central repository is automated using Yahoo! contextual search services. The collected data is organized using semantic web technologies so that the data can be more easily shared and used for innovative analyses.

abstract={We consider the problem of customizing video playlist where a system for constructing a playlist composed of a sequence of videos that attain a specific user profile is proposed. Each video item is represented as a collection of weighted attributes that represent the accompanying features. The proposed solution allows users to construct a sequence of video items by imposing global and transitional constraints. Transitional constraints deal with the similarity between successive video objects while global constraints ensure that the retrieved video attributes attain the proposed user profile. The retrieved sequence of videos is constructed by considering it as a solution to a constrained sequence retrieval problem where constraints represent user preferences. The constrained retrieval problem is then modeled as a network flow model which leads to integer program. Relaxation techniques are then used for complexity reduction. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed model in constructing the playlist according to user needs.},

Recommendation of personalized information / services in location based services has become an attractive trend for success of businesses. A Recommender System attempts to solve the problem of information overload and provides product and service recommendation based on user profile and preferences. The location of the user is an important information item that can be associated to the existing user profile in order to provide efficient recommendations. Also, easy availability of GPS enabled devices brings a large amount of GPS trajectories representing user's mobile logs. These GPS trajectories can be used to mine interesting patterns about users. We have studied the utility and application of information extracted from user's GPS trajectory data in recommender systems. We conceive that recommendation has an intrinsic social component and therefore this work takes a perspective towards the social aspect in location based recommender systems.

We propose to resolve this problem by exploring, experimentally, new ways of inferring knowledge from past IDE-interactions, and of maximizing collaboration among developers. Our approach, called Adinda, revolves around transforming the IDE into a set of integrated services, accessible via a web browser, and enriched with Web 2.0 technologies. Such services will not only help developers perform traditional IDE tasks, but also facilitate the required informal communication and collaboration needs of software development projects. In this paper, we report on our vision, approach and challenges for building Adinda, and initial results.},

abstract={Social information systems - popularized by Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, and other social websites - are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for distributed social-powered information management. While there has been growing interest in these systems by businesses, government agencies, and universities, there remain important open challenges that must be addressed if the potential of these social systems is to be fully realized. For example, the presence of poor quality users and users intent on manipulating the system can disrupt the quality of socially-powered information and knowledge sharing applications. In this paper, we outline the SocialTrust++ project at Texas A&M University. The overall research goal of the SocialTrust++ project is to develop, analyze, deploy, and test algorithms for building, enabling, and leveraging community-based trust in Social Information Systems. Concretely, we are developing a trustworthy community-based information platform so that each user in a Social Information System can have transparent access to the community's trust perspective to enable more effective and efficient social information access.},

abstract={Data sharing services on the web host huge amounts of resources supplied and accessed by millions of users around the world. While the classical approach is a central control over the data set, even if this data set is distributed, there is growing interesting in decentralized solutions, because of good properties (in particularity, privacy and scaling up). In this paper, we explore a machine learning side of this work direction. We propose a novel technique for decentralized estimation of probabilistic mixture models, which are among the most versatile generative models for understanding data sets. More precisely, we demonstrate how to estimate a global mixture model from a set of local models. Our approach accommodates dynamic topology and data sources and is statistically robust, i.e. resilient to the presence of unreliable local models. Such outlier models may arise from local data which are outliers, compared to the global trend, or poor mixture estimation.

abstract={The aim of the present paper is to analyze the user's behavior in Web 2.0 through comparing statistical data from a Web 1.0 site and an online community from Web 2.0. In order to emphasize the difference between the two concepts, we have taken into consideration the following: new vs. returning visitors, visitor loyalty, length as well as the depth of the visit to the site. Analyzing the data, one can observe that the visitor loyalty, their lengthy visits to the site and the pages they view are much higher for the site built on the principles of Web 2.0, compared to the classical sites. Likewise, we developed and implemented a collaborative tagging system that allows every registered user to publish, save and label the content with the help of tags. Therefore, this can help in building a model that not only offers customized content but also adapts the site to user needs by providing a recommendation system and aggregate collective intelligence.},

abstract={Service oriented architecture (SOA) promotes highly standardized, loosely coupled and Web-enabled services to foster rapid, low-cost and easy composition of distribute applications. Critical to SOA software development is to acquire users' requirements and to provide service analysis and design techniques for identifying, conceptualizing, profiling, and rationalising service-enable applications. Semantic-enabled requirements engineering (SRE) for developing service-oriented applications helps to transform disordered users' needs into ordered requirement specifications. It facilitates requirements acquisition with multiple stakeholders' participation. It further enhances semantic-conducted services aggregation and eventually provides customized service productions according to process semantics of requirements. This paper concentrates on user-centric service customization with a paradigm shift from classical provider-centric service provision to user-centric active service production. Subscription and pushing technology of ATOM/RSS is adopted to actively push users' needs to service providers. Semantic description of service requirements is proposed, and characterizes in identifying process (workflow) and service. A customized service production platform is designed to demonstrate its practicability and effectiveness.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging sites allow users to save and annotate their favorite Web contents with tags. These tags provide a novel source of information for collaborative filtering. However, major gap exists in how to integrate tagging information into traditional recommender systems for better recommendation quality, due to the difficulty to quantize these semantic tags. This paper proposes a novel approach to convert this semantic information into quantitative values from a smoothing point of view, taking advantage of the topic-based method, and then make recommendation in a traditional user-based CF fashion based on the smoothed user-item matrix. Experiments on two real-world collaborative tagging datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract={Active learning is an effective way of engaging users to interactively train models for visual recognition. The vast majority of previous works, if not all of them, focused on active learning with a single human oracle. The problem of active learning with multiple oracles in a collaborative setting has not been well explored. Moreover, most of the previous works assume that the labels provided by the human oracles are noise free, which may often be violated in reality. We present a collaborative computational model for active learning with multiple human oracles. It leads to not only an ensemble kernel machine that is robust to label noises, but also a principled label quality measure to online detect irresponsible labelers. Instead of running independent active learning processes for each individual human oracle, our model captures the inherent correlations among the labelers through shared data among them. Our simulation experiments and experiments with real crowd-sourced noisy labels demonstrated the efficacy of our model.},

abstract={For more than a decade, researchers have been proposing various methods and techniques to mine social tagging data and to learn structured knowledge. It is essential to conduct a comprehensive survey on the related work, which would benefit the research community by providing better understanding of the state-of-the-art and insights into the future research directions. The paper first defines the spectrum of Knowledge Organization Systems, from unstructured with less semantics to highly structured with richer semantics. It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories. We summarize the prominent issues with the current research and highlight future directions on learning constantly evolving knowledge from social media data.},

abstract={The global scale and distribution of companies have changed the economy and dynamics of businesses. Web-based collaborations and cross-organizational processes typically require dynamic and context-based interactions between people and services. However, finding the right partner to work on joint tasks or to solve emerging problems in such scenarios is challenging due to scale (number of involved people and services) and the temporary nature of collaborations. Furthermore, actor skills and competencies evolve over time requiring dynamic approaches for the management of actor properties. Web services and SOA are the ideal technical framework to automate interactions spanning people and services. In this paper, we present a novel discovery mechanism based on social trust to support formation and dynamic interactions in service-oriented collaboration networks. We argue that trust between members is essential for successful collaborations. Here we discuss profile similarity-based link establishment to connect disparate network segments.},

On the other hand, the Social Web helps in clustering Web users into communities, and let them be prosumers of their Web experience. Both visions encompass many online applications, including Education. On the question of what is really the next stage of Web developments for Education, authors usually focus on a single of these two facets of the Web.

pages={94-103},
abstract={The amount of diverse tags used to classify posts on Stack Overflow increased in the last years to more than 38,000 tags. Many of these tags have the same or similar meaning. Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags. To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 randomly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

abstract={The folksonomy is the result of free personal information or assignment of tags to an object (determined by the URI) in order to find them. The practice of tagging is done in a collective environment. Folksonomies are self constructed, based on co-occurrence of definitions, rather than a hierarchical structure of the data. The downside of this was that a few sites and applications are able to successfully exploit the sharing of bookmarks. The need for tools that are able to resolve the ambiguity of the definitions is becoming urgent as the need of simple instruments for their visualization, editing and exploitation in web applications still hinders their diffusion and wide adoption. An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces. To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called " Folksodriven" is used in this paper. While it is presented the Folks driven Structure Network (FSN) to resolve the ambiguity of definitions of folksonomy tags suggestions for the user. On this base a Human-Computer Interactive (HCI) systems is developed for the visualization, navigation, updating and maintenance of folksonomies Knowledge Bases - the FSN - through the web. System functionalities as well as its internal architecture will be introduced.},

For tag recommendation, we use an efficient discriminative clustering approach. To develop our self-optimization strategy for this tag recommendation approach, we empirically investigate when and how to update the tag recommender with minimum human intervention. We present a nonlinear optimization model whose solution yields the clustering parameters that maximize the recommendation accuracy within an administrator specified time window. Evaluation on "BibSonomy'' data produces promising results. For example, by using our self-optimization strategy a 6% increase in average F1 score is achieved when the administrator allows up to 2% drop in average F1 score in the last one thousand recommendations.},

abstract={Transfer learning is a new learning paradigm, in which, besides the training data for the targeted learning task, data that are related to the task (often under a different distribution) are also employed to help train a better learner. For example, out-dated data can be used as such related data. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning framework for training neural network (NN) ensembles. The framework has two key features: 1) it uses the well-known negative correlation learning to train an ensemble of diverse neural networks from the related data, fully discovering the knowledge in the data; and 2) a penalized incremental learning scheme is used to adapt the neural networks obtained from negative correlation learning to the training data for the targeted learning task. The adaptation is guided by reference neural networks that measure the relatedness between the training and the related data. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that our framework can achieve classification accuracy competitive to existing ensemble transfer learning methods such as TrAdaBoost and TrBagg. We discuss some characteristics of our framework observed in the experiment and the scenarios under which the framework may have superior performance.},

Web sites allowing resources to be tagged provide a tremendous amount of user-generated taxonomic information. However, information seekers are hindered by the lack of organization within these tags as well as the multitude of domains encompassed within these sites. To address these issues, we propose a multi-step approach for creating domain specific concept hierarchies from collaborative tags. Each concept hierarchy is based on domain specific subject matters, which may span more than one tag, as opposed to related work which are only concerned with the relationships between single tags.},

A recommender system compares user profiles to some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item that they have not yet considered. These characteristics may be considered as content-based approach, collaborative filtering demographic filtering and hybrid recommender systems. Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommender systems. These methods are based on collecting and analyzing the information of a particular user behavior, activity, preferences and will predict the user's interest according to the similarity of other users. In this paper we address the problem of scalability associated with CF and propose a CF framework that combines collaborative tagging with genre interestingness measure for a movie RS. Our experiments on each movie dataset with recent timestamp demonstrate that the proposed CFT -GIM gives more accurate predictions of user's ratings as compared to both CF and CFT.},

abstract={In current Android systems, the application recommendation function is an important feature that users can use to find a similar application to replace a targeted one. The current recommendation system provided through Google and the Google Play store presumably recommends applications similar to a target application while accounting for the popularity of each application. However, it does not take the security features of each application or users preferences into consideration when doing so. In this paper, we propose DroidVisor, an Android tool that provides users with fine-grained and customizable application recommendations. Compared to the Google store recommendation function, DroidVisor does not only use the similarity to a preselected target application, but also considers other metrics such as popularity, security, and usability. More specifically, DroidVisor provides an interface for users to configure the weight of each metric and a recommendation algorithm that generates a list of recommended applications based on the combined scores. We evaluate our proposed criteria and the quality of recommendation through use case studies. Finally, we present our findings through a discussion of accuracy as well as possible ways to improve our recommendation results.},

The design allows users to create food entries either via a traditional database lookup or a streamlined '+1' approach. 24 people used POND to create predefined food entries. We found people preferred different approaches to creating entries, which reflected their self-reported nutrition concerns.

abstract={The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming data.},

abstract={As a social bookmark tool, Folksonomy gives high freedom to users and allows users to share and notate resources. However, many tags applied arbitrarily by users can not really reflect the contents of web pages and lead to ineffectiveness in information retrieval. Moreover, there are still some important tasks about how to eliminate ambiguity more easily and recommend more interested web pages to users. To resolve the above problems, we propose a novel mechanism named SSTAG, and it can recommend a set of Super-tags to users for their choices based on keywords input. As various topics related to the keywords, the Super-tags are selected from different clusters of web pages related to the keywords. A user chooses a Super-tag, which means the user may have chosen an interested topic, and then some more detailed tags in the topic are recommended as Sub-tags. The relationship between Super-tag and Sub-tag is just like navigation and positioning. Likewise, the user can choose one Sub-tag and submit it with the Super-tag. By means of the user's choice, this system can capture users' preference and recommend a series of related web pages. We employ a real world dataset to examine the mechanism, and the experimental results show that this mechanism can eliminate ambiguity efficiently and recommend a set of appropriate tags.},

title={Diverse Dimension Decomposition of an Itemset Space},

pages={725-734},
abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases. A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive item sets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the item set space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and delicious, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains.},

abstract={Software engineers share experiences with modern technologies by means of software information sites, such as Stack Overflow. These sites allow developers to label posted content, referred to as software objects, with short descriptions, known as tags. However, tags assigned to objects tend to be noisy and some objects are not well tagged. To improve the quality of tags in software information sites, we propose EnTagRec, an automatic tag recommender based on historical tag assignments to software objects and we evaluate its performance on four software information sites, Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, and Free code. We observe that that EnTagRec achieves Recall@5 scores of 0.805, 0.815, 0.88 and 0.64, and Recall@10 scores of 0.868, 0.876, 0.944 and 0.753, on Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, and Free code, respectively. In terms of Recall@5 and Recall@10, averaging across the 4 datasets, EnTagRec improves Tag Combine, which is the state of the art approach, by 27.3% and 12.9% respectively.},

abstract={Operational definitions of music preferences are at the core of psychological research exploring individual differences (personality, expertise) and their relation to a variety of musical behaviors. However, the measurement instruments for music preferences mostly rely on subjective likings for genres, a notion known to be problematic in several ways. We present a framework to derive music preferences based on free responses about liked and disliked artists. The framework uti lizes social tags and online databases to aggregate comparable data to the existing genre-based measures. This frame work was tested in a sample of 408 participants, who indicated their musical preferences using a genre-based measure and free textual responses. A comparison of both forms of data suggested that a genre-based measure can be reliably re covered from the free responses using the framework. The framework has the advantage of being ecologically valid and flexible in terms of the possible inputs and outputs.},

abstract={In the context of a project aimed at the development of a cooperative and distributed Authoring System to facilitate the production, sharing, and integration of new and existing content from various domains, this work addresses problems related to locating, annotating and reusing audio and video streams distributed over the Internet. The Authoring System allows partial annotations (applied to a part and not to the whole document) and time-based tagging of audio and video streams (where the semantic information is applied only to portions of the stream) and provides tools to extract partial contents and mixes them, creating new resources. These resources are represented with an envelope composed of many references that point to other contents (whole or portions of) within the Internet. This envelope holds only references where multimedia portions, called fragments, are located and they are stored as a meta-data. In such a way, the Authoring System prevents multimedia element duplications. Both original and newly created content are delivered to clients using the state of the art streaming technology that is integrated into the Authoring System to provide a uniform interface both to consume and produce knowledge.},

With new technologies, such as blogs, twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, people may create and disseminate content as never before. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Additionally, many open-source initiatives have shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. We have been working in this domain for a few years now, mostly focusing on small disaster relief groups and field command. One of the command problems is lack of information about the location where the disaster occurred. We believe some of this information could be crowdsourced, changing current practices and enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for crowdsourcing and present an initial proposal for harnessing collective intelligence for the fire department.},

abstract={A large part of the modern web is characterized by usergenerated content categorized using collaborative tagging or folksonomy. It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results.},

With the help of tagging data, user annotation preference and document topical tendency are substantially coded into the profiles of users or documents. However, obtaining the proper relationship among user, resource and tag is still a challenge in social annotation based recommendation researches. In this paper, we utilize the relationship from between tags and resources and between tags and users to extract group information. With the help of such relationship, we can obtain the Topic-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and resources, and Interest-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and users. The preliminary experiments have been conducted on Movie Lens dataset to compare our proposed approach with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation approach approach in terms of precision, and the result demonstrates that our approach could considerably improve the performance of recommendations.},

abstract={Rapid growth of published Web services makes their discoveries more and more difficult. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keyword based and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged Web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords.},

SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes.},

year={2009},
volume={4},
pages={1060-1065},
abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario.},

pages={1140-1146},
abstract={Nowadays social semantic Web has become one of the most important sources of data. The quality of data is crucial for data integration and annotation in social Linked Open Data (LOD). The main goal of tweets classification and linking is to integrate all tweets that are related semantically in one place on the Web. The data inequality problems exist because authors post tweets and hashtag them based on their own preference. The authors can post tweets in different languages (English-Arabic). Therefore, the hashtags cannot be the only trackback function of the tweet to link it with the related tweets. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop an automated tweet classifier which is not limited by the language or the category of the tweet. The approach can create new suggested multilingual (English, Arabic) hashtags from tweet's content and comments "auto-tagging" in social linked open data (LOD), matching the tweets in the same topic and provides high accuracy and performance using blocking and indexing techniques. The proposed framework has substantial improvements in tweets classification and linking compared to state of the art framework of classifying and linking techniques with better classifying rate which reach 95% in precision and 97% in recall.},

year={2013},
pages={199-208},
abstract={In this paper we investigate the properties of a cognitive heuristics based approach, by way of which the mobile devices of users can become aware of the physical environment surrounding them. Cognitive heuristics are the mental models used in cognitive psychology to describe how human brains efficiently process the huge amount of information constantly coming from the environment around us. As personal mobile devices represent proxies in the cyber world of their human users, we investigate how the same cognitive heuristics can be used by mobile devices to become self-aware of the features of the physical environment around their users. Specifically, we assume that physical locations are described as a network of tags. We consider a self-organising opportunistic network environment, where devices exchange information when meeting directly. We propose algorithms based on cognitive heuristics through which users' nodes obtain tags either directly when coming in proximity of locations, or indirectly through other nodes they meet. We analyse the properties of the networks of tags resulting at individual nodes, as they emerge from this process, as a function of various cognitive parameters. We show that using cognitive heuristics leads, under the same resource constraints, to much more effective information diffusion with respect to other reference solutions. Interestingly, we find critical thresholds for key parameters that discriminate between information diffusion and information loss. Finally, we show that, despite resource constraints, the structure of the network of tags at individual nodes is remarkably close to the ideal that would be obtained with infinite resources.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is one of the most popular services available online, and it allows end user to loosely classify either online or offline resources based on their feedback, expressed in the form of free-text labels (i.e., tags). Although tags may not be per se sensitive information, the wide use of collaborative tagging services increases the risk of cross referencing, thereby seriously compromising user privacy. In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging has been gaining increasing popularity in a large variety of websites. The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature.},

title={FakeMask: A Novel Privacy Preserving Approach for Smartphones},
year={2016},
volume={13},
number={2},
pages={335-348},
abstract={Users can enjoy personalized services provided by various context-aware applications that collect users' contexts through sensor-equipped smartphones. Meanwhile, serious privacy concerns arise due to the lack of privacy preservation mechanisms. Currently, most mechanisms apply passive defense policies in which the released contexts from a privacy preservation system are always real, leading to a great probability with which an adversary infers the hidden sensitive contexts about the users. In this paper, we apply a deception policy for privacy preservation and present a novel technique, FakeMask, in which fake contexts may be released to provably preserve users' privacy. The output sequence of contexts by FakeMask can be accessed by the untrusted context-aware applications or be used to answer queries from those applications. Since the output contexts may be different from the original contexts, an adversary has greater difficulty in inferring the real contexts. Therefore, FakeMask limits what adversaries can learn from the output sequence of contexts about the user being in sensitive contexts, even if the adversaries are powerful enough to have the knowledge about the system and the temporal correlations among the contexts. The essence of FakeMask is a privacy checking algorithm which decides whether to release a fake context for the current context of the user. We present a novel privacy checking algorithm and an efficient one to accelerate the privacy checking process. Extensive evaluation experiments on real smartphone context traces of users demonstrate the improved performance of FakeMask over other approaches.},

abstract={It is difficult to get satisfactory customer churn prediction effect for the traditional model, because the class distribution of customer data is often imbalanced, and the available data in target task is little. This paper combines the transfer learning with the ensemble learning, and proposes a feature selection based transfer ensemble model (FSTE). It utilizes the customer data in both the related source domain and target domain, selects a series of feature subsets, obtains the corresponding training subsets by mapping; further, it trains a number of classifiers and gets the final customer churn prediction result by integrating the prediction results. The empirical results show that FSTE can achieve better customer churn prediction performance compared with the traditional churn prediction model, and some existing transfer learning models such as TFS, TrBagg and TrAdboost.},

There are growing needs to get useful information from Twitter, because an enormous amount of information is transmitted in real time. Twitter users, who play an important role as information sources, typically transmit information about some particular topics which they are interested in. Therefore, to identify useful information, it is very important to know which topics a user tends to transmit. In this paper, we propose a method to discover appropriate topics for a user by using Twitter list. Twitter list is an official functionality to make a"user list, " list members tend to transmit information about the topic represented in the name of the list. From this observation, our idea is to extract tags from list names, and exploit the relationship among lists, tags extracted from the list names, and list members. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The high potential of knowledge to create economies of scale attracted the interest towards understanding the dynamics of its diffusion. The new developments in the collaborative and participatory role of web emerges new knowledge structures driving the need towards Web based indicators for studying the diffusion of knowledge on Web. We present the results of an exploratory case-study investigating the tagging and citing practices for the WWW `06 conference papers. We observed two important patterns: (1) Papers which got heavily tagged in all three applications Delicious, Citeulike and Bibsonomy (average total tags > 6) generally achieved a high number of citations. We also observed that most of the tags were from 2006 and most of the citations were from 2007. This indicated that tags may hold the potential of foretelling the future volume of regenerative diffusion of research. (2) Terms appearing in tag-clouds of highly tagged papers in 2006 reappear frequently in the titles of respective citing papers in 2007. This shows that tag clouds may have the potential of forecasting the context of diffusion as well. It furthermore indicates that the users tag the papers with multiple tags according to their specific contexts of use as well as content of that knowledge artifact. Based on these patterns we propose that tags may be used as a supplementary indicator to model the diffusion of knowledge on Web.},

abstract={The abundance of educational resources available on the Web leads to information overload for the students and the difficulty in finding useful and relevant resources for a specific learning context. The solution that we propose in this paper is a platform called Edu3R (Educational Resources Retrieval and Recommendation), which relies on community filtering: students enrolled in the same course can perform collaborative search through various learning object repositories, bookmark the resources of interest, rate them and share them with peers. The rationale is that resources found and selected by peers are likely to be relevant since the learning community is centered around the same course and the same learning tasks and is relatively homogeneous (classmates generally having common learning backgrounds and completing the same curriculum). Edu3R also relies on social tagging, through which learners annotate resources with meaningful terms that reflect the educational context, provide a personalized classification and facilitate subsequent retrieval. Finally, Edu3R also integrates a collaborative filtering mechanism for recommending learning resources based on student similarity. The paper provides an overview of the system architecture, functionalities and pedagogical rationale, as well as a comparison with similar platforms.},

abstract={We describe a semantic imitation model of social tagging that integrates formal representations of semantics and a stochastic tag choice process to explain and predict emergent behavioral patterns. The model adopts a probabilistic topic model to separately represent external word-topic and internal word-concept relations. These representations are coupled with a tag-based topic inference process that predicts how existing tags may influence the semantic interpretation of a document. The inferred topics influence the choice of tags assigned to a document through a random utility model of tag choices. We show that the model is successful in explaining the stability in tag proportions across time and power-law frequency-rank distributions of tag co-occurrences for semantically general and narrow tags. The model also generates novel predictions on how emergent behavioral patterns may change when users with different domain expertise interact with a social tagging system. The model demonstrates the weaknesses of single-level analyses and highlights the importance of adopting a multi-level modeling approach to explain online social behavior.},

abstract={With ubiquitous access to Web 2.0 applications, users on social networks can now collaboratively author and share hypermedia learning resources, contributing to more engaging learning experiences in Technology-Enhanced Learning outside formal education. Though these resources are ready to be harnessed for educational purposes, they may or may not be educational or may be suitable for some users only. Hence, it is crucial to annotate these resources to personalize these resources to different user needs. We propose to annotate learning resources with folksonomy-derived description metadata for personalization to context profiles of users. A semantic model for folksonomy was formulated to integrate controlled vocabularies in folksonomy. It not only reduces reliance on domain experts in annotating learning resources but also opens new avenues for more comprehensive resource description, compared to numerical ratings in resource recommendation algorithm. The working principle of the resource annotation and recommendation mechanism is demonstrated via a prototype system implemented in a social network environment. A pilot user study shows that learners are positive about the system in terms of aspects apart from accuracy.},

title={Data tagging architecture for system monitoring in dynamic environments},
year={2008},
pages={395-402},
abstract={Large enterprise systems need continuous monitoring at infrastructure, application and business levels to detect and prevent problem situations. Traditionally, automated monitoring solutions are programmed once at setup based on a set of well-defined monitoring objectives and handed over to the operations team. Such solutions have underlying data models that are often complex and semantically rich but in stable environments, this complexity is generally hidden from the operations team, who only need to make minor configuration changes (e.g. setting thresholds) as and when required. However, the situation is now rapidly changing with enterprise data centers being subject to continuous transformations as new software, hardware and process components get deployed or updated. This puts an immense burden on monitoring activity because not only thousands of different parameters need to get monitored but the addition and modification of service level objectives (SLOs) may happen continuously. We describe a monitoring system architecture which simplifies the task of authoring and managing SLOs in such dynamic and heterogeneous environments. At the heart of our approach is a lightweight and extensible data model that is derived from more complex configuration models, so as to only expose data relevant for monitoring to the operations team. Simple string-tags derived from this model are then used to label SLOs and associated data streams. The approach localizes programming to the data-sensor layer and makes authoring simpler than the specification of objects in an alternate richer but complex object-oriented representation. We also describe a tag-driven real-time visualization tool that can organize data streams using their accompanying tags and ease user navigation through large volumes of monitoring data.},

title={Transfer Ensemble Model for Customer Churn Prediction with Imbalanced Class Distribution},
year={2011},
volume={3},
pages={177-181},
abstract={Customer churn prediction is an important issue in customer relationship management. The class distribution of customer data is often imbalanced, which may affect the performance of churn prediction model greatly. This paper combines transfer learning and multiple classifiers ensemble, and proposes a transfer ensemble model for imbalanced data (TEMID). This method focuses on using transfer learning and sampling to enlarge the available training set and balance it respectively. What's more, it also uses multiple classifiers ensemble method to implement the classification. The performance of TEMID and some existing transfer learning algorithms are compared in two class imbalanced datasets. The results show that the TEMID methods can actually improve the performance of the customer churn prediction.},

title={Web 2.0 social bookmark selection for tag clustering},
year={2013},
pages={510-516},
abstract={Tagging is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 web sites. A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper.},

title={Analyzing and retrieving illicit drug-related posts from social media},
year={2016},
pages={1555-1560},
abstract={Illicit drug use is a serious problem around the world. Social media has increasingly become an important tool for analyzing drug use patterns and monitoring emerging drug abuse trends. Accurately retrieving illicit drug-related social media posts is an important step in this research. Frequently, hashtags are used to identify and retrieve posts on a specific topic. However hashtags are highly ambiguous. Posts with the same hashtags are not always on the same topic. Moreover, hashtags are evolving, especially those related to illicit drugs. New street names are introduced constantly to avoid detection. In this paper, we employ topic modeling to disambiguate hashtags and track the changes of hashtags using semantic word embedding. Our preliminary evaluation shows the promise of these methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of how toexploit folksonomy systems and social bookmarking tools toenrich DBpedia ontology while unifying the formal knowledgerepresented by DBpedia ontology with the informal knowledge emerging from tagging. Our approach taps into external tools such as the sense inventory WordNet to correct mistakes resulted from the free tagging and takes advantage from semantic relationships between tags to recognize resources'context. We performed evaluations with focus on the particularly challenging problem of resources' ambiguity to prove that not all resources shared in folksonomies are relevant resources for DBpedia ontology and to show that our pre-processing step increases precision values.},
