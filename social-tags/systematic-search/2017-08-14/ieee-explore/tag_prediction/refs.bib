abstract={Content-based music information retrieval tasks have traditionally been solved using engineered features and shallow processing architectures. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},

abstract={Recent advances in neural network training provide a way to efficiently learn representations from raw data. Good representations are an important requirement for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks to be performed successfully. However, a major problem with neural networks is that training time becomes prohibitive for very large datasets and the learning algorithm can get stuck in local minima for very deep and wide network architectures. In this paper we examine 3 ways to improve feature learning for audio data using neural networks: 1.using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) instead of standard sigmoid units; 2.using a powerful regularisation technique called Dropout; 3.using Hessian-Free (HF) optimisation to improve training of sigmoid nets. We show that these methods provide significant improvements in training time and the features learnt are better than state of the art handcrafted features, with a genre classification accuracy of 83 Â± 1.1% on the Tzanetakis (GTZAN) dataset. We found that the rectifier networks learnt better features than the sigmoid networks. We also demonstrate the capacity of the features to capture relevant information from audio data by applying them to genre classification on the ISMIR 2004 dataset.},

abstract={Image annotation, or prediction of multiple tags for an image, is a challenging task. Most current algorithms are based on large sets of handcrafted features. Deep convolutional neural networks have recently outperformed humans in image classification, and these networks can be used to extract features highly predictive of an image's tags. In this study, we analyze semantic information in features derived from two pre-trained deep network classifiers by evaluating their performance in nearest neighbor-based approaches to tag prediction. We generally exceed performance of the manual features when using the deep features. We also find complementary information in the manual and deep features when used in combination for image annotation.},

abstract={Music genre classification is a challenging task in the field of music information retrieval. Existing approaches usually attempt to extract features only from acoustic aspect. However, spectrogram also provides useful information because it describes the temporal change of energy distribution over frequency bins. In this paper, we propose the use of Gabor filters to generate effective visual features that can capture the characteristics of a spectrogram's texture patterns. On the other hand, acoustic features are extracted using universal background model and maximum a posteriori adaptation. Based on these two types of features, we then employ SVM to perform the final classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that combining visual and acoustic features can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy on two widely used datasets.},

abstract={Tag recommendation systems are either personalized or non-personalized. Personalized tag recommendation utilizes a user's tagging behavior from her tagging history for predictions. Whereas non-personalized recommendation systems recommend what is popular and relevant to the user. In this study, we have analyzed the role of personal tagging history in recommending tags. The experiments are done on three folksonomy datasets: Delicious, Flickr and Bibsonomy. Important results for three popular tag recommendation algorithms: PITF, FolkRank and Adapted PageRank are reported in terms of prediction quality. It is found that users' history usage preferences change across all data sets; hence overall prediction quality of personalized recommendation system may suffer. We discover a generic life cycle of folksonomy users on the basis of their history usage. We propose this life cycle can be used to improve an overall prediction performance of a recommendation system across all folksonomies.},

abstract={With an increasing number of images that are available in social media, image annotation has emerged as an important research topic due to its application in image matching and retrieval. Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

abstract={Automatic tag annotation is one of the most important problems in multimedia information retrieval. It has been motivated by the large amount of unstructured tag annotation data provided by internet users and can be viewed as a variation of multi-label classification with special characteristics and constraints. Stacking is a technique in which the outputs (binary or probabilistic) of a set of binary classifiers (one for each tag) are used as input to a second stage of classification that attempts to exploit latent relationships between tags. This technique (known under a variety of names) has been used in a variety of multimedia tag annotation systems. In this paper we survey these approaches, clarify how stacking system are structured, and empirically investigate stacking using a variety of classifier combinations in the context of tagging pieces of music.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks. Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost.},

abstract={One of the characteristics of tag prediction mechanisms is that, typically, all user models are constructed with the same granularity. In this paper we hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that in order to increase tag prediction accuracy, the granularity of each user model has to be adapted to the level of usage of each particular user. We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

year={2017},
pages={272-282},
abstract={Software developers can search, share and learn development experience, solutions, bug fixes and open source projects in software information sites such as StackOverflow and Freecode. Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

abstract={Image representation learning is a fundamental problem in understanding semantics of images. However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

abstract={Web-based platforms, such as social networks, review web-sites, and e-commerce web-sites, commonly use recommendation systems to serve their users. The common practice is to have each platform captures and maintains data related to its own users. Later the data is analyzed to produce user specific recommendations. We argue that recommendations could be enriched by considering data consolidated from multiple sources instead of limiting the analysis to data captured from a single source. Integrating data from multiple sources is analogous to watching the behavior and preferences of each user on multiple platforms instead of a limited one platform based vision. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which utilizes user specific data collected from multiple platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming to make recommendations by consulting multiple social networks to produce a rich modeling of user behavior. For this purpose, we collected and anonymized a specific dataset that contains information from BlogCatalog, Twitter and Flickr web-sites. We implemented several different types of recommendation methodologies to observe their performances while using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources. The conducted experiments showed that using multiple features from multiple social networks produces a wider perspective of user behavior and preferences leading to improved recommendation outcome.},

abstract={Online social networking sites such as Flickr and Facebook provide a diverse range of functionalities that foster online communities to create and share media content. In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

abstract={Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags.

In this paper, we exploit three-level of memory hierarchy to break the data dependency and reduce the number of access for external memory.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems with user generated content have become a fundamental element of websites such as Delicious, Flickr or CiteULike. By sharing common knowledge, massively linked semantic data sets are generated that provide new challenges for data mining. In this paper, we reduce the data complexity in these systems by finding meaningful topics that serve to group similar users and serve to recommend tags or resources to users. We propose a well-founded probabilistic approach that can model every aspect of a collaborative tagging system.

year={2014},
pages={545-552},
abstract={Tags, as high quality semantic descriptors, are used in categorization, clustering and efficient retrieval of various items in the web corpus. Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common items which are tagged either manually or in a semiautomatic manner. However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).},

In contrast to existing video synopsis approaches that rely on visual cues alone, we propose a novel multi-source synopsis framework capable of correlating visual data and independent non-visual auxiliary information to better describe and summarise subtle physical events in complex scenes. Specifically, our unsupervised framework is capable of seamlessly uncovering latent correlations among heterogeneous types of data sources, despite the non-trivial heteroscedasticity and dimensionality discrepancy problems. Additionally, the proposed model is robust to partial or missing non-visual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on two crowded public surveillance datasets.},

abstract={TnT is an efficient statistical Parts-of-speech (POS) Tagger based on Hidden Markov Model. TnT stands for Trigrams`n'Tags. Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the best tag sequence for a given observation sequence of words. TnT performs well on known word sequences. But, the performance degrades with increase in the number of unknown words. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome this performance degradation using fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rule based model is designed to provide TnT with sufficient information about the tag of unknown words without degrading the performance of TnT. When TnT with fuzzy rule based learning encounters an unknown word, the TnT generates a set of possible tags for the given word, based on the fuzzy rules matched by the word. If the word does not match any fuzzy rule, then the model depends upon the probability distribution of the suffix. This approach guarantees that the performance of TnT will only be improved from its normal performance.},

abstract={Application domains such as scientific networks, blogs, and groups share information in a huge amount; this information is usually unstructured data in text documents. Document annotation is one of the popular methods, where metadata present in document is used to search documents from a large text documents database. Attribute-value pair annotations use either content or querying value of attributes or both for annotation. Using content and querying value together increases the visibility of documents more efficiently than using them individually. Selection of attributes for annotation is called as âAttribute Suggestion Problemâ. Various methods like information extraction and query forms have been used for this purpose, but they are expensive and inaccurate. We present an alternative approach, which will provide relevant attributes for annotation, having high content and querying value, with speed and accuracy.},

The documents, words, and tags are represented as low-dimensional vectors and are jointly learned with a multi-layered neural language model.

In the second stage, we use thus obtained document and tags representations to learn user representations. We utilize these jointly trained vector representations for personalized tag recommendation tasks. Our experiments on two widely used bookmarking datasets show a significant improvements for quality of recommendations. These continuous vector representations has the added advantages of conceptually meaningful which we show by our qualitative analysis on tag suggestion tasks.},

year={2014},
volume={16},

pages={1986-1998},
abstract={An image in social media, termed a social image, exhibits characteristics different from images widely discussed in image processing. They can be described by both content and social related attributes, called social image attributes, including visual contents, users, tags, and timestamps. There are strong coupling relationships between social image attributes, which make social images not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). By analyzing the relationships among these attributes, we can better understand the semantic activities conducted on such non-IID social images, hence enabling new applications including content organization, recommendation, and social activity understanding. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to analyze the coupling relationships between social images, which involves not only intra-coupled similarity within a social image attribute, but also inter-coupled similarity between attributes, in analyzing the non-IIDness of the similarity between social images. In particular, we propose a multi-entry version of the coupled similarity metric to deal with attributes (i.e., tags) which have a many-to-one relationship with respect to images. Experimental results on a Flickr group dataset show that the proposed algorithm captures coupling relationships and therefore achieves promising results in various applications, including image clustering and tagging.},

Then we get their bigrams through frequent pattern matching. In order to generate more flexible and socialized tags, we expand keywords and their bigrams by exploring tag associations mined from a famous bookmarking web del.icio.us. Finally we rank the three parts of tag candidates under a uniform metric. Unlike previous models used for tag recommendation task, our model needs neither seed tags for source texts nor a complete tag set. It can recommend new tags out of the historical tag set. We evaluate our methods on 10,265 Chinese dialogues. Experimental results show our method outperform previous models like TextRank, TFIDF rank and KNN.},

abstract={An increasingly large portion of scheduler latency is derived from the monolithic content addressable memory arrays accessed during instruction wake-up. The performance of the scheduler can be improved by decreasing the number of tag comparisons necessary to schedule instructions. Using detailed simulation-based analyses, we find that most instructions enter the window with at least one of their input operands already available. By putting these instructions into specialized windows with fewer tag comparators, load capacitance on the scheduler critical path can be reduced, with only very small effects on program throughput. For instructions with multiple unavailable operands, we introduce a last-tag speculation mechanism that eliminates all remaining tag comparators except those for the last arriving input operand. By combining these two tag-reduction schemes, we are able to construct dynamic schedulers with approximately one quarter of the tag comparators found in conventional designs. Conservative circuit-level timing analyses indicate that the optimized designs are 20-45% faster and require 10-20% less power depending on instruction window size},

abstract={The concept of Web 2.0 or "semantic web" has been getting more and more popular during the last half decade. The potential of very subtle yet important emergent semantics hidden in such environments calls for equally elegant and powerful methods to "mine" them. However, much of the previous work on model based recommender systems for folksonomies considered user to resource and resource to tag similarity separately, ignoring the dependency of users' interest to both the tags and the corresponding resources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic personalized recommendation model, Latent Interest Model, that accounts for users, tags and resources jointly. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on real data sets obtained from a popular online bookmarking site using different performance measures for tag and resource recommendation tasks. Our experimental results show that our model captures personal preferences for tag usage and resource selection. Performance evaluation of Latent Interest Model indicates that the proposed personalized method yields significant improvement of recommendation accuracy.},

abstract={Recently social tagging systems are increasingly becoming popular. These systems allow users to manage, organize and search their required resources. Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy. The experimental results on a real-world dataset, Citeulike, indicate significant improvements in recommendation quality and better performance compared with the existing systems.},

abstract={Audio tags correspond to keywords that people use to describe different aspects of a music clip. With the explosive growth of digital music available on the Web, automatic audio tagging, which can be used to annotate unknown music or retrieve desirable music, is becoming increasingly important. This can be achieved by training a binary classifier for each tag based on the labeled music data. Our method that won the MIREX 2009 audio tagging competition is one of this kind of methods. However, since social tags are usually assigned by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation information is useful for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem and propose two solutions to solve it. The experimental results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

year={2014},

abstract={Among cache write-through and write-back policies, write-through policy is more efficient and offers better performance in high performance microprocessors. In write-through policy, write is done synchronously both to cache and main memory. But, write-through policy causes large energy overhead due to frequent lower lever cache accesses during write operations. A new cache architecture called Tag-Bloom cache is proposed in order to reduce the power consumption. Here, a tag is attached to each way in the L2 cache. This way tag is stored in way-tag array in L1 cache. Utilizing these tags, L2 cache can be accessed as a direct mapping cache during subsequent write hits, thereby power consumption is reduced. A Bloom Filter is introduced to accurately predict the cache miss and hot/cold checks. A considerable energy saving is obtained based on SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks along with a small area overhead and no performance degradation. High-performance microprocessors now-a-days use longer addresses and hence cache tag arrays become longer. This concept of Tag-Bloom can be applied to other existing cache design techniques to achieve further power reduction.},

In the retrieval systems, text description/tags play a key role to bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and higher-level concepts, and so guarantee the reliable search. However, in practice manual tags are usually noisy and incomplete, resulting in a limited performance of image retrieval. To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic topic model to formalize the correlation of tags with visual features via the latent semantic topics. Our proposed approach allows us to effectively annotate and refine tags based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm for approximate inference. Moreover, we present a measuring scheme using the refined tags and extracted topics for ranking the images. The experimental results from two large benchmark datasets show that our approach provides promising accuracy.},

year={2011},
pages={353-360},
abstract={Folksonomy systems provide a way for users to share and organize bookmarks. The social relationship among users has become stronger with the rapid development of new technologies. Finding the leading objects has become an important topic. These research topics are always centered around finding the most popular pages or experts. In this paper, we propose a new notion of expertise, which we call user insight. User insight denotes the user's expertise in finding Web pages that are useful or have the potential to be popular pages before other users find them. To address the issue, we refer to three major types of Web pages, namely, isolated, well-known, and burgeoning. Burgeoning pages are exceptionally useful and attractive for users in a folksonomy system. In our paper, we build a time-based algorithm to estimate user insight. In addition, we discuss the social relationship within fan networks, and we propose a link-based algorithm called CAIS (Community-based Annotation Insight Search) to realize the reinforcement between users, communities and pages. Finally, we design several experiments to evaluate the performance of CAIS and compare it to other approaches. We prove that CAIS has a better performance for the user ranking of simulated data and real data from Delicious.},

abstract={Nowadays high-performance microprocessors make use of cache write-through policy for performance improvement and achieving good tolerance to soft errors in on-chip cache. However write through policy incurs large power utilization, while accessing the cache at low level (L2 cache) during write operation. In existing method, way_tagged cache was used under write-through policy, it's consumed more energy. A new cache architecture has a partial tag enhanced-bloom filter is used to improve the accuracy of cache miss prediction. By maintaining the wag tag of L2 cache in the L1 cache during read operation. The proposed technique enables L2 cache to work in direct mapping manner during write hit and reducing tag comparison of cache miss prediction, if cache miss is predicted there is no need to access the L2 cache. So that significant portion of energy will be reduced, without performance degradation. Simulation results are obtained both L1 and L2 cache configuration. The proposed technique achieves 63% energy saving in L2 cache on average with only 0.02% area overhead and no performance degradation, when compare with existing methods.},

pages={628-631},
abstract={Social tagging enables users of social media sharing platforms to annotate multimedia items by employing arbitrary keywords (i.e., tags), which describe better the multimedia content. Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a âquery and rankingâ manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either â2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.},

abstract={The exponential growth of social networks (SN) currently makes them the standard way to share and explore data where users put informations (images, text, audio,...) and refer to other contents. This creates connected networks whose links provide valuable informations in order to enhance the performance of many tasks in information retrieval including ranking and annotation. We introduce in this paper a novel image retrieval framework based on a new class of kernels referred to as ânetwork-dependentâ. The main contribution of our method includes (i) a variational framework which helps designing a kernel using both the intrinsic image features and the underlying contextual informations resulting from different (e.g. social) links and (ii) the proof of convergence of the kernel to a fixed-point, that is positive definite and thus associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Experiments conducted on different ground truths, including the ImageClef/Flickr set, show the outperformance and the substantial gain of our ranking kernel with respect to the use of classic ânetwork-freeâ kernels.},

title={Tag recommendation in software information sites},
year={2013},
pages={287-296},
abstract={Nowadays, software engineers use a variety of online media to search and become informed of new and interesting technologies, and to learn from and help one another. We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively. Moreover, averaging over StackOverflow and Freecode results, we improve TagRec proposed by Al-Kofahi et al. by 22.65% and 14.95%, and the tag recommendation method proposed by Zangerle et al. by 18.5% and 7.35% for recall@5 and recall@10 scores.},

pages={176-185},
abstract={Cold-start scenarios in recommender systems are situations in which no prior events, like ratings or clicks, are known for certain users or items. To compute predictions in such cases, additional information about users (user attributes, e.g. gender, age, geographical location, occupation) and items (item attributes, e.g. genres, product categories, keywords) must be used. We describe a method that maps such entity (e.g. user or item) attributes to the latent features of a matrix (or higher-dimensional) factorization model. With such mappings, the factors of a MF model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy. We use the mapping concept to construct an attribute-aware matrix factorization model for item recommendation from implicit, positive-only feedback. Experiments on the new-item problem show that this approach provides good predictive accuracy, while the prediction time only grows by a constant factor.},

abstract={Hashtags are useful for categorizing and discovering content and conversations in online social networks. However, assigning hashtags requires additional user effort, hampering their widespread adoption. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach for hashtag recommendation, targeting English language tweets on Twitter. First, we make use of a skip-gram model to learn distributed word representations (word2vec). Next, we make use of the distributed word representations learned to train a deep feed forward neural network. We test our deep neural network by recommending hashtags for tweets with user-assigned hashtags, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the objective function. We also test our deep neural network by recommending hashtags for tweets without user-assigned hashtags. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach recommends hashtags that are specific to the semantics of the tweets and that preserve the linguistic regularity of the tweets. In addition, our experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of generating hashtags that have not been seen before.},

year={2017},
volume={5},
pages={6688-6696},
abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of social image tagging using practical vocabulary for mobile users on the social media. On the social media, images usually have an incomplete or noisy set of social tags provided by the mobile users, and we consider this issue as defective tag assignments. Previous studies on social image tagging have mostly focused on multi-label classification without considering the defective tags. In these studies, the usage of multi-label classification techniques is expected to synergically exploit the linear relations between the image features and the semantic tags. However, these approaches usually aimed to capture the linear relations from the training data while ignoring the helpful information from the test data. In addition, they failed to incorporate the non-linear associations residing in the visual features as well as in the semantic tags. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel approach based on non-linear matrix completion for image tagging task with defective tags. Specifically, we first construct the entire feature-tag matrix based on the visual features with non-linear kernel mapping. Then, we present a formal methodology together with an optimization method under the matrix completion framework to jointly complete the tags of training and test images. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method shows promising results on image tagging task on two benchmark social image datasets with defective tags, and establishes a baseline for such models in this research domain.},

abstract={Being able to predict whether a song can be a hit has important applications in the music industry. Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

abstract={A branch target buffer (BTB) can reduce the performance penalty of branches in pipelined processors by predicting the path of the branch and caching information used by the branch. Two major issues in the design of BTBs that achieves maximum performance with a limited number of bits allocated to the BTB implementation are discussed. The first is BTB management. A method for discarding branches from the BTB is examined. This method discards the branch with the smallest expected value for improving performance; it outperforms the least recently used (LRU) strategy by a small margin, at the cost of additional complexity. The second issue is the question of what information to store in the BTB. A BTB entry can consist of one or more of the following: branch tag, prediction information, the branch target address, and instructions at the branch target. Various BTB designs, with one or more of these fields, are evaluated and compared},

abstract={In this paper, we present a subclass-representation approach that predicts the probability of a social image belonging to one particular class. We explore the co-occurrence of user-contributed tags to find subclasses with a strong connection to the top level class. We then project each image onto the resulting subclass space, generating a subclass representation for the image. The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes. Our contribution is to demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive method for generating sub-class representations has the ability to improve classification results in the case of tag classes that are visually highly heterogenous. The approach is evaluated on a set of 1 million photos with 10 top-level classes, from the dataset released by the ACM Multimedia 2013 Yahoo! Large-scale Flickr-tag Image Classification Grand Challenge. Experiments show that the proposed system delivers sound performance for visually diverse classes compared with methods that directly model top classes.},

abstract={Audio tags describe different types of musical information such as genre, mood, and instrument. This paper aims to automatically annotate audio clips with tags and retrieve relevant clips from a music database by tags. Given an audio clip, we divide it into several homogeneous segments by using an audio novelty curve, and then extract audio features from each segment with respect to various musical information, such as dynamics, rhythm, timbre, pitch, and tonality. The features in frame-based feature vector sequence format are further represented by their mean and standard deviation such that they can be combined with other segment-based features to form a fixed-dimensional feature vector for a segment. We train an ensemble classifier, which consists of SVM and AdaBoost classifiers, for each tag. For the audio annotation task, the individual classifier outputs are transformed into calibrated probability scores such that probability ensemble can be employed.

abstract={This paper addresses recommending presentation sessions at smart conferences to participants. We propose a venue recommendation algorithm: socially aware recommendation of venues and environments (SARVE). SARVE computes correlation and social characteristic information of conference participants. In order to model a recommendation process using distributed community detection, SARVE further integrates the current context of both the smart conference community and participants. SARVE recommends presentation sessions that may be of high interest to each participant. We evaluate SARVE using a real-world dataset. In our experiments, we compare SARVE with two related state-of-the-art methods, namely context-aware mobile recommendation services and conference navigator (recommender) model. Our experimental results show that in terms of the utilized evaluation metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and f-measure, SARVE achieves more reliable and favorable social (relations and context) recommendation results.},

abstract={Web services are considered reusable elements that can be exploited stand-alone or as part of wider, generic or domain-specific, applications. With a vast variety of Web Services being offered by service providers, annotation techniques that add tags to services automatically are frequently exploited with the aim of retrieving relevant services faster. Tagging of Web Services at finer levels of granularity can assist in drawing more detailed conclusions, making their use easier. In this paper, we go beyond global Web Service tagging by proposing a classification technique for the annotation of Web Service sections. The process focuses on port type, operation and message sections of the service description. Service information as offered through WSDL and the provider and user descriptions is considered. The initial evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in providing annotations at these different service levels.},

abstract={An automatic classification system of the music genres is proposed. Based on the timbre features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the spectro-temporal features are obtained to capture the temporal evolution and variation of the spectral characteristics of the music signal. Mean, variance, minimum, and maximum values of the timbre features are calculated. Modulation spectral flatness, crest, contrast, and valley are estimated for both original spectra and timbre-feature vectors. A support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier where an elaborated kernel function is defined. To reduce the computational complexity, an SVM ranker is applied for feature selection.

abstract={In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

In this paper, we propose a Chinese topic-oriented search engine service, named as Foxinfo1.0, which provides a 360 degree view of the topic that interests the users who're seeking it. Different from the original topic-search which employs the keyword-based topic to retrieve and aggregate relevant information, Foxinfo1.0 could organize information from different abstraction level by employing tag to describe the topics of queries and information. Further, in order to predict tags from queries and web documents, a tag prediction algorithm named as CTAG is proposed, which could concern tags from different levels, and performs much better than the baseline method like AutoTag.},

abstract={Automatic and fast tagging of natural sounds in audio collections is a very challenging task due to wide acoustic variations, the large number of possible tags, the incomplete and ambiguous tags provided by different labellers. To handle these problems, we use a co-regularization approach to learn a pair of classifiers on sound and text. The first classifier maps low-level audio features to a true tag list. The second classifier maps actively corrupted tags to the true tags, reducing incorrect mappings caused by low-level acoustic variations in the first classifier, and to augment the tags with additional relevant tags. Training the classifiers is implemented using marginal co-regularization, pair of which draws the two classifiers into agreement by a joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on two sound datasets, Freefield1010 and Task4 of DCASE2016. The results obtained show that marginal co-regularization outperforms the baseline GMM in both efficiency and effectiveness.},

abstract={Visualizing audio signals during playback has long been a fundamental function of music players. However, most visual effects are generated by audio signal processing directly and render meaningless or incomprehensible displays to users. In this paper, we present an intelligent music player called the Playing with Tagging (PWT) music player. By integrating a real-time music tagger, the PWT player can display dynamic tag distributions via a set of tag bars that move in sync with the music. To synchronize the tag distributions, the music tagger must be able to online recognize the music tags. We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played. To evaluate the real-time tagging function, we simulate tag prediction on short music chunks. The results of experiments on the MajorMiner dataset demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed music tagging method.},

title={A Segmented Bloom Filter Algorithm for Efficient Predictors},
year={2008},
pages={123-130},
abstract={Bloom Filters are a technique to reduce the effects of conflicts/interference in hash table-like structures. Conventional hash tables store information in a single location which is susceptible to destructive interference through hash conflicts. A Bloom Filter uses multiple hash functions to store information in several locations, and recombines the information through some voting mechanism. Many microarchitectural predictors use simple single-index hash tables to make binary 0/1 predictions, and Bloom Filters help improve predictor accuracy. However, implementing a true Bloom Filter requires k hash functions, which in turn implies a k-ported hash table, or k sequential accesses. Unfortunately,the area of a hardware table increases quadratically with the port count, increasing costs of area, latency and power consumption. We propose a simple but elegant modification to the Bloom Filter algorithm that uses banking combined with special hash functions that guarantee all hash indexes fall into non-conflicting banks. We evaluate several applications of our Banked Bloom Filter (BBF) prediction in processors: BBF branch prediction, BBF load hit/miss prediction, and BBF last-tag prediction. We show that BBF predictors can provide accurate predictions with substantially less cost than previous techniques.},

abstract={The launch of Xbox Kinect has built a very successful computer vision product and made a big impact on the gaming industry. This sheds lights onto a wide variety of potential applications related to action recognition. The accurate estimation of human poses from the depth image is universally a critical step. However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when facing severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within a specific human action domain. Furthermore, as an extension, we learn a conditional model by incorporation of pose tags to further increase the accuracy of pose correction. In the experiments, significant improvements on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction are observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system. Our experiments for the facial landmark correction also illustrate that our algorithm can improve the accuracy of other detection/estimation systems.},

abstract={Recommending text tags for on-line photos is useful for Internet photo services. Typical solutions to this problem require analysis of the correlation among different attributes of the photos, including the correlation between the textual features and visual features computed from a photo. However, most on-line photos have very few tags or even no tags, and thus they contribute little or none to the analysis of tag-photo correlation, which is a key component in those schemes that rely on such analysis for tag recommendation. To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a dataset of more than 33,000 photos collected from Flickr.},

The results so far are encouraging. Students at BigSE Lab have found numerous "standard' choices for text mining that could be replaced by simpler and less resource intensive methods. Further, that work also found additional text mining choices that could significantly improve the performance of industrial data miners.},

Special cases of the JSLRR-based classifier are the joint sparse representation-based classifier and the low-rank representation-based one. The performance of the three aforementioned classifiers is compared against that of the sparse representation-based classifier, the nearest subspace classifier, the support vector machines, and the nearest neighbor classifier for music genre classification on six manually annotated benchmark datasets.

abstract={While a listener may derive semantic associations for audio clips from direct auditory cues (e.g., hearing âbass guitarâ) as well as from âcontextâ (e.g., inferring âbass guitarâ in the context of a ârockâ song), most state-of-the-art systems for automatic music annotation ignore this context. Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.},

The latent sub-tag information is exploited in our framework to assist the learning of our end goal, i.e., tag prediction. We use the cowatch information to initialize the learning process.

abstract={More and more content on the Web is generated by users. To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

year={2015},
volume={9},

pages={806-813},
abstract={Nowadays, the number of digital images has increased so that the management of this volume of data needs an efficient system for browsing, categorising and searching. Automatic image annotation is designed for assigning tags to images for more accurate retrieval. Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image annotation applications.},

abstract={This paper tackles the geospatial tag estimation problem, which is of critical importance for location-based search, retrieval, and mining applications. However, tag estimation is challenging due to massive sparsity, uncertainty in the tags actually used, as well as diversity across locations and times. Toward overcoming these challenges, we propose a community-based smoothing approach that seeks to uncover hidden conceptual communities which link multiple related locations by their common interests in addition to their proximity. Through extensive experiments over a sample of millions of geotagged Twitter posts, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the smoothing approach and validate the intuition that geo-locations have the tendency to share similar âideasâ in the formation of conceptual communities.},

year={2016},
pages={2452-2457},
abstract={Automatic image annotation has been an important research topic in facilitating large scale image management and retrieval. Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.},

abstract={While Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems, which focus on previous indicate preferences, are known for their traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, most existing approaches use trust as an independent factor from time, in this paper we argue that trust value between users is dynamic; hence it change over time. For this reason we propose a novel temporal-trust based approach to calculate trust values aware of time of friendship. To validate the proposed approach in this paper, we used Delicious data set and compared our approach with traditional CF and trust-based approaches.

abstract={This paper presents a group-aware mobile crowd sensing system called MobiGroup, which supports group activity organization in real-world settings. Acknowledging the complexity and diversity of group activities, this paper introduces a formal concept model to characterize group activities and classifies them into four organizational stages. We then present an intelligent approach to support group activity preparation, including a heuristic rule-based mechanism for advertising public activity and a context-based method for private group formation. In addition, we leverage features extracted from both online and offline communities to recommend ongoing events to attendees with different needs. Compared with the baseline method, people preferred public activities suggested by our heuristic rule-based method. Using a dataset collected from 45 participants, we found that the context-based approach for private group formation can attain a precision and recall of over 80%, and the usage of spatial-temporal contexts and group computing can have more than a 30% performance improvement over considering the interaction frequency between a user and related groups. A case study revealed that, by extracting the features such as dynamic intimacy and static intimacy, our cross-community approach for ongoing event recommendation can meet different user needs.},

abstract={In China, it is free for users to introduce themselves with tags on Sina weibo, the biggest Chinese microblogging platform. User tags provide much useful information for user retrieval and precision advertising. However, 64.2% of users in our study have not tagged themselves. This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

This situation makes it difficult for researchers (especially juniors) to attend the right presentation session(s) for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an innovative venue recommendation algorithm to enhance smart conference participation. Our proposed algorithm, Social Aware Recommendation of Venues and Environments (SARVE), computes the Pearson Correlation and social characteristic information of conference participants. SARVE further incorporates the current context of both the smart conference community and participants in order to model a recommendation process using distributed community detection. Through the integration of the above computations and techniques, we are able to recommend presentation sessions of active participant presenters that may be of high interest to a particular participant. We evaluate SARVE using a real world dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that SARVE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

To exploit the useful interrelatedness between these two heterogeneous prediction tasks, we propose a new correlation guided structured sparse multi-task learning method. We utilize a joint classification and regression model to identify annotation-informative and geotag-relevant image features. We also introduce the tree-structured sparsity regularizations into multi-task learning to integrate the label correlations in multi-label image annotation. Finally we derive an efficient algorithm to optimize our non-smooth objective function. We demonstrate the performance of our method on three real-world geotagged multi-label image data sets for both semantic annotation and geotag prediction.},

We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within specific human action domain. Our algorithm is illustrated on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction.

abstract={Even though small ASR errors might not impact downstream processes that make use of the transcript, larger error segments like those generated by OOVs can have a considerable impact on applications such as speech-to-speech translation and can eventually lead to communication failure between users of the system. This work focuses on error detection in ASR output targeted towards significant error segments that can be recovered using a dialog system. We propose a CRF system trained to recognize error segments with ASR confidence-based, lexical and syntactic features. The most significant error segment is passed to a dialog system for interactive recovery in which rephrased words are reinserted in the original. 22% of utterances can be fully recovered and an interesting by-product is that rewriting error segments as a single token reduces WER by 17% on an adverse corpus.},

year={2012},
pages={1-12},
abstract={Social communication websites has been an emerging type of a Web service that helps users to share their resources. For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naiÌve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

year={2017},

pages={1-14},
abstract={Crowdsourcing systems provide a cost effective and convenient way to collect labels, but they often fail to guarantee the quality of the labels. This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

volume={26},
number={7},
pages={3303-3316},
abstract={Due to the unprecedented growth of unedited videos, finding highlights relevant to a text query in a set of unedited videos has become increasingly important. We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) âviraletsâ, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including usersâ comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.). 1

Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.

abstract={KNN-based image annotation method is proved to be very successful. However, it suffers from two issues: (1) high computational cost; (2) the difficulty of finding semantically similar images. In this paper, we propose a graph-based dimensionality reduction method to solve the two problems by adapting the locality sensitive discriminant analysis method [1] to multi-label setting. We first determine relevant and irrelevant images based on label information and construct relevant and irrelevant graphs by focusing on the visually similar relevant and irrelevant images. A linear feature transformation matrix is derived by considering the two graphs. The transformation can map the images to a low-dimensional subspace in which neighborhood relevant images are pulled closer while irrelevant images are pushed away. Thus the new feature after dimensionality reduction is quite fit for KNN-based image annotation. Experiments on the Corel dataset also demonstrate the effectiveness of our dimensionality reduction method for KNN-based image annotation.},

abstract={We present a multi-layer group sparse coding framework for concurrent image classification and annotation. By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes the image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Then we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. Moreover, we extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) which captures the nonlinearity of features, and further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sport and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.},

year={2014},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Music auto-tagging refers to automatically assigning semantic labels (tags) such as genre, mood and instrument to music so as to facilitate text-based music retrieval. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

Tags are used freely, which leads a random correspondence between the tags and the services, which affects the performance of the tag in the search and applications. We propose a novel scheme for tag predicting based on graph, aiming to automatically sort the tags associated with a given API services according to their relevance to the service content using the theory of random walk. Tag sorting is applied to tag predicting of Web service. We evaluate our methodology through experiment using open data set. Our results show that our approach really boosts the performances of tag predicting.},

year={2013},
pages={219-223},
abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most successful technology for recommender systems. The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

abstract={In this work, we study the task of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging systems. To include candidate tags beyond the existing vocabularies of the query resource and of the query user, we examine recommendation methods that are based on personomy translation, and propose a probabilistic framework for adopting translations from similar users (neighbors). We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

abstract={Previous work has correctly identified that many of the tags that users provide on images are not visually relevant, and subsequently assume such user generated tags are noise or irrelevant. Another assumption about user generated tags is that the order of these tags provides no useful information for the prediction of tags on future images. We challenge the aforementioned assumptions, and provide a machine learning approach to the problem of personalized image tagging with the following contributions: 1.) We reformulate the personalized image tagging problem as a search/retrieval ranking problem, 2.) We leverage the order of tags, which does not always reflect visual relevance, provided by the user in the past as a cue to their tag preferences, similar to click data, 3.) We propose a technique to augment sparse user tag data (semi-supervision), and 4.) We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a subset of Flickr images, showing improvement over our previous methods.},

title={PPP: Joint Pointwise and Pairwise Image Label Prediction},
year={2016},
pages={6005-6013},
abstract={Pointwise label and pairwise label are both widely used in computer vision tasks. For example, supervised image classification and annotation approaches use pointwise label, while attribute-based image relative learning often adopts pairwise labels. These two types of labels are often considered independently and most existing efforts utilize them separately. However, pointwise labels in image classification and tag annotation are inherently related to the pairwise labels. For example, an image labeled with "coast" and annotated with "beach, sea, sand, sky" is more likely to have a higher ranking score in terms of the attribute "open", while "men shoes" ranked highly on the attribute "formal" are likely to be annotated with "leather, lace up" than "buckle, fabric". The existence of potential relations between pointwise labels and pairwise labels motivates us to fuse them together for jointly addressing related vision tasks. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between class labels, tags and attributes, and propose a novel framework PPP(Pointwise and Pairwise image label Prediction), which is based on overlapped group structure extracted from the pointwise-pairwise-label bipartite graph. With experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance on three vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

This categorization is multi-class and multi-tag, which means, a question can be assigned to different topics and can also have several tags. To solve this problem, we propose a 5-way multi-class classifier system. The results obtained by this classification scheme are discussed, by analysing certain score metrics of the classifier system. Competitive results were obtained by the 5-way classifier system, obtaining F1 scores ranging from 0.59 to 0.76.

abstract={Automatic music tagging is addressed by resorting to auditory temporal modulations and Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). The starting point is to represent each music recording by its auditory temporal modulations. Then, an irregular third order tensor is formed. The first slice contains the vectorized training temporal modulations, while the second slice contains the corresponding multi-label vectors. The PARAFAC2 is employed to effectively harness the multi-label information for dimensionality reduction. Any vectorized test auditory representation of temporal modulations is first projected onto the semantic space derived via the PARAFAC2 and the coefficient vector is obtained. Then, the annotation vector is obtained by multiplying this coefficient vector by the left singular vectors of the second slice (i.e., the slice associated to the label vector). The proposed framework, outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 10-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

year={2013},
pages={438-447},
abstract={In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

abstract={Audio tags correspond to keywords that people use to de scribe different aspects of a music clip, such as the genre, mood, and instrumentation. Since social tags are usually as signed by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation is another useful information for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem. The results of audio tag annotation and retrieval experiments demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

Such textual collections consists of significant amount of structured information, which remains buried in the unstructured text. Even though information extraction algorithms provides the extraction of structured relations, they are often expensive and inaccurate. We present an alternative approach that facilitates the generation of the structured metadata which is useful for querying the database. Document annotations are comments, notes, or other types of external remarks that can be attached to a document. Our approach relies on the idea that humans can add the valuable metadata during creation time prompted by an interface. We can increase the quality of searching to some extent, if the documents are properly annotated. Existing probabilistic approaches have some demerits. This paper proposes an approach that uses inverted indexing scheme for effective mining of informations.

year={2012},
pages={497-500},
abstract={A novel multi-label annotation method is proposed and applied to music tagging. Each music recording is represented by its auditory temporal modulations (ATMs). Given a set of training music recordings represented by the tag-music recording matrix having zero-one (indicator) vectors of the tags associated with each recording in its columns along with the matrix of the ATM representations in its columns, a low-rank weight matrix is sought, such that the tag-music recording matrix is expressed as the product of the weight matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations plus an error matrix. Clearly, such a weight matrix captures the relationships between the labels (i.e., tags) and the audio features. It can be derived by solving a convex nuclear norm minimization problem, if the tag-music recording matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations are assumed to be jointly low-rank. Having found the weight matrix, the annotation vector for labeling any test music recording can be obtained by multiplying the weight matrix with its ATM representation. The just outlined method is referred to as low-rank representation based multi-label annotation (LRRMA). The LRRMA outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

Next, for each feature set a Deep Belief Network was trained without supervision on a large music collection. The respective distances of the output units of the Deep Belief Networks between two music excerpts are computed, normalized and finally combined to form the distance measure. The proposed method was evaluated on the MIREX 2013 Audio Music Similarity task. Results are encouraging, however, they indicate that the harmonic similarity component degrades the performance.},

year={2014},
volume={16},
number={3},
pages={762-771},
abstract={We present a multi-layer group sparse coding framework for concurrent single-label image classification and annotation. By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Therefore we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. To make our model more suitable for nonlinear separable features, we also extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Moreover, we also integrate our multi-layer group sparse coding with kNN strategy, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sports and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.},

abstract={Parts of speech tagging forms the important pre-processing step in many of the natural language processing applications like text summarization, question answering and information retrieval system. MorphoSyntactic disambiguation (part of speech tagging) is the process of classifying every word in a given context to its appropriate part of speech. In this paper, we first review all the supervised machine learning approaches that have been used in the part of speech tagging. Then we review all the Arabic works to compare and to confirm our need to develop an accurate and efficient Arabic morphosyntactic disambiguation system.

abstract={As Internet usage and e-commerce grow, online social media serve as popular outlets for consumers to express sentiments about products. On Amazon, users can tag an album with a keyword, while tweets on Twitter represent a more natural conversation. The differing natures of these media make them difficult to compare. This project collects and analyzes social media data for newly released music albums and develops new methods of comparing a product's social tags to its microblogging data. It explores information retrieval and rank correlation measures as similarity measures, as well as term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) processing. We conclude that with sufficient Twitter activity about an album, social tags do represent the most frequent conversations occurring on Twitter. These results imply that managers can collect and analyze tags and use them as a proxy for most common consumer feedback from microblogging, which is more difficult to collect.},

abstract={Social tagging is becoming more and more popular in various Web 2.0 applications nowadays. It is important for many web-sites with tagging capabilities like âdeliciousâ or âflickrâ. These social tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanism which assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them, where tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item. In this paper, we propose an approach for tag recommendation based on users' interest lattice matching (UILM). UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments.},

In this paper, we study how one can take advantages of the already-tagged images to (semi-)automate the labeling of newly uploaded ones. In particular, we propose a hybrid approach for the prediction where user-provided tags and image visual contents are fused under a unified probabilistic framework. Kernel smoothing and collaborative filtering techniques are explored for improving the accuracy of the probabilistic models estimation. By comparing with some state-of-the-art content-based image labeling methods, we have empirically shown that 1) the proposed method can achieve comparable tag prediction accuracy when there is no user-provided tag, and that 2) it can significantly boost the prediction accuracy if the user can provide just a few tags.},

abstract={Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing web pages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

pages={73-76},
abstract={Automatic tagging of music has mostly been treated as a classification problem. In this framework, the association of a tag to a song is characterized in a âhardâ fashion: the tag is either relevant or not. Yet, the relevance of a tag to a song is not always evident. Indeed, during the ground-truth annotation process, several annotators may express doubts, or disagree with each other. In this paper, we propose to fuse annotators' decisions in a way to keep information about this uncertainty. This fusion provides us continuous scores, that are used for training a regressive boosting algorithm. Our experiments show that regression with this soft ground truth leads to a more accurate learning, and better predictions, compared to traditionally used binary classification.},

abstract={Automatic image annotation has drawn much attention in the last two decades due to its application in social images organization. Most studies treat image annotation as a typical multi-label classification problem, which requires sufficient number of training samples with complete and clean tags to train reliable prediction models. Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples. A variety of experiments conducted on image datasets ESPGame, IAPRTC-12, and NUS-WIDE prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Social tags have become widely used in web applications which not only reflect the user's personality but also item's properties and semantic meanings. We design an algorithmic framework by extending item-based collaborative filtering with social tags which we call IBeST. IBeST contains the whole lifecycle of the item similarity measurement based on social tags and improves item-based algorithmic results in four phases: dataset preprocessing, metadata injection, algorithm selection and optimization, and similarity weight selection. The calculated similarity is then used in item-based algorithm. MovieLens 10M ratings 100k tags dataset is used in our experiment. IBeST generates improved recommendation ratings than baseline item-based algorithms, and provides a feasible and loosely coupled solution to use social tags in item-based recommendation system.},

abstract={The development of social media has led to a burst of interest in image-related metadata information, such as tags and geo-tags. Tags are semantic keywords that are assigned to an image. Image tagging enables the users of social media sharing platforms to annotate images, facilitating image search and content description. Despite the volume of related research, issues such as accuracy or efficiency still remain open problems. Here, a novel method for simultaneous image tagging and geo-location prediction is proposed that is based on hypergraph learning. The method is further improved by enforcing group sparsity constraints. It fully exploits various types of information, such as social, image-related metadata, or similarities based on visual attributes. Experiments on a dataset crawled from Flickr demonstrate F1 at 10 top ranked tags equal to 0.558 for image tagging and cumulative geotagging prediction rate at 3 top ranks equal to 83%.},

year={2012},
pages={162-166},
abstract={The availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. This paper discusses about an approach for automatic annotation in digital images. Some of the previous models for automatic image annotations are translation model (TM), continuous-space relevance model (CRM) and multiple Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM).These models have some semantic gap problems. To avoid these problems here developed a hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which is used to combine both low-level image features and user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based on the low-level image features. Low-level features are color, texture and shape. For images with user provided tags, HPM use both the image features and the tags to recommend additional tags to label the images. Here a Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) is used to capture both color and texture information. An L1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The kernel density estimation is accelerated by an Improved Fast Gauss transform(IFGT).When the number of images becomes larger then Tag-Image Association Matrix (TIAM) used in the HPM framework become very sparse, thus it is very difficult to estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. So a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for tackling this data sparsity issue. Here a CF algorithm is used to find the correlation between the words. Building such a HPM will make image labelling more efficient and less labour intensive.},

year={2013},
pages={59-70},
abstract={Data-dependent branches constitute single biggest source of remaining branch mispredictions. Typically, data-dependent branches are associated with program data structures, and follow store-load-branch execution sequence. A set of memory locations is written at an earlier point in a program. Later, these locations are read, and used for evaluating branch condition. Branch outcome depends on data values stored in data structure, which, typically do not have repeatable pattern. Therefore, in addition to history-based dynamic predictor, we need a different kind of predictor for handling such branches. This paper presents Store-Load-Branch (SLB) predictor; a compiler-assisted dynamic branch prediction scheme for data-dependent direct and indirect branches. For every data-dependent branch, compiler identifies store instructions that modify the data structure associated with the branch. Marked store instructions are dynamically tracked, and stored values are used for computing branch flags ahead of time. Branch flags are buffered, and later used for making predictions. On average, compared to standalone TAGE predictor, combined TAGE+SLB predictor reduces branch MPKI by 21% and 51% for SPECINT and EEMBC benchmark suites respectively.},

abstract={We propose a novel approach to the problem of expertise mining in an enterprise, taking advantage of online social applications deployed within the enterprise. Based on the assumption that the userspsila interactions with such social software reflect to some extent their expertise, we devise a probabilistic method for identifying the main areas of expertise of users based solely on their set of tags extracted from a social bookmarking system. We base our approach on statistical language models, which we adapt to fit our unique setting. We train and validate our model on a real world dataset extracted from two IBM-internal applications. Our results show that our approach provides a viable alternative to other methods that rely on documents extracted from the enterprise corpora.},

abstract={Community bulletin boards serve an important function for public information sharing in modern society. Posted fliers advertise services, events, and other announcements. However, fliers posted offline suffer from problems such as limited spatial-temporal coverage and inefficient search support. In recent years, with the development of sensor-enhanced mobile devices, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been used in a variety of application areas. This paper presents FlierMeet, a crowd-powered sensing system for cross-space public information reposting, tagging, and sharing. The tags learned are useful for flier sharing and preferred information retrieval and suggestion. Specifically, we utilize various contexts (e.g., spatio-temporal info, flier publishing/reposting behaviors, etc.) and textual features to group similar reposts and classify them into categories. We further identify a novel set of crowd-object interaction hints to predict the semantic tags of reposts. To evaluate our system, 38 participants were recruited and 2,035 reposts were captured during an eight-week period. Experiments on this dataset showed that our approach to flier grouping is effective and the proposed features are useful for flier category/semantic tagging.},

title={Automatic image tagging and recommendation via PARAFAC2},
year={2015},
pages={1-6},
abstract={An important aspect when sharing images in social networks is the tags the images are annotated with. Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

year={2012},
volume={1},
pages={292-296},
abstract={Content-based social tagging recommendation, which considers the relationship between the tags and the descriptions contained in resources, is proposed to remedy the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering. There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

abstract={Recommender systems are useful techniques for solving the problem of information overload. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most successful approach for recommendation. This approach focuses on previous indicate preferences which is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and hacking. For solving the problem of hacking and improving the accuracy, trust-based CF methods have been proposed previously. These methods focused on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, most existing approaches use trust as a factor independent from time which we think that trust value between users is dynamic; hence it change over time. For this reason, we used friendship time and proposed a novel temporal-trust based approach called AgeTrust to measure trust value. To validate the proposed approach, we used Delicious data set and compared our approach with two other traditional trust-based approaches: traditional CF and FriendshipTrust. Result shows that our proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches.},

abstract={This paper proposes and evaluates Sharing/Timing Adaptive Push (STAP), a dynamic scheme for preemptively sending data from producers to consumers to minimize critical-path communication latency. STAP uses small hardware buffers to dynamically detect sharing patterns and timing requirements. The scheme applies to both intra-node and inter-socket directory-based shared memory networks. We integrate STAP into a MOESI cache-coherence (prefetching-enabled) protocol using heuristics to detect different data sharing patterns, including broadcasts, producer/consumer, and migratory-data sharing. Using 15 benchmarks from the PARSEC and SPLASH-2 suites we show that our scheme significantly reduces communication latency in NUMA systems and achieves an average of 9% performance improvement, with at most 3% on-chip storage overhead.},

abstract={This paper presents a renewed image annotation baseline method under the nearest neighbor tag transfer framework. Two key problems are considered in this paper: (1) which images are determined as the neighbors; (2) how their keywords are transferred. Firstly, a soft neighbor selection scheme is designed by image embedding technique, with which we can provide more power to the crucial neighbors in decision making. Next, diffused tag propagation is introduced to allow one tag be propagated to other relevant tags. Besides this, the above two measures are formulated into an optimization framework to further improve the prediction performance. Experimental results on standard database show that the proposed approaches outperform the current state-of-the-art methods.},

In addition, this paper deals with clustering the augmented documents, the outcome of the Clustering Analysis is added to the domain ontology as additional leaves under the âSubSubSubconcept = lectureâ. From each cluster, we extract the Topn keywords (descriptive terms), then we modify the ontology accordingly by adding the cluster's terms as semantic terms under the âSubSubSubconcept = lectureâ to which these documents belong. This research is implemented and evaluated on a real platform HyperManyMedia at Western Kentucky University.},

abstract={The amount of diverse tags used to classify posts on Stack Overflow increased in the last years to more than 38,000 tags. Many of these tags have the same or similar meaning. Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags. To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 randomly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

abstract={Concept labeling and ontology-free tagging are the two typical manners of image annotation. Despite extensive research efforts have been dedicated to labeling, currently automatic image labeling algorithms are still far from satisfactory, and meanwhile manual labeling is rather labor-intensive. In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity. Experiments are conducted on different datasets and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Prior knowledge in concept acquisition among students is an important issue. Traditional studies on prior knowledge generation during learning have focused on extracting sentences from reading materials that are manually generated by website administrators and educators. From the reports of previous studies, tag-based recommendation and assessment has been recognized as being an effective approach that can assist learners in finding out the clues and concepts of articles, such that it enables learners to be familiar with the learning content. However, sparse noisy data influences the quality of recommendations, especially for tag choices that are not mapped to the features of both the users and content. To cope with these problems, we adopt a hybrid recommendation method to consider tag preference, tag relevance and social networking. The experimental results show that the approach benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge, and can be an effective and efficient mechanism for enhancing the quality of prior knowledge recommendation.},

abstract={Image auto-annotation is an important open problem in computer vision. For this task we propose TagProp, a discriminatively trained nearest neighbor model. Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

However, obtaining the proper relationship among user, resource and tag is still a challenge in social annotation based recommendation researches. In this paper, we utilize the relationship from between tags and resources and between tags and users to extract group information. With the help of such relationship, we can obtain the Topic-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and resources, and Interest-Groups based on the bipartite relationship between tags and users.

Relevant images from a large pool are recommended to a reference user or a reference geo-location. In addition to that, the hypergraph ranking problem is enhanced by enforcing group sparsity constraints. By adjusting the different weights associated to the object groups, we control each object group effect in the recommendation process.

We challenge the aforementioned assumptions, and provide a machine learning approach to the problem of personalized image tagging with the following contributions: 1.) We reformulate the personalized image tagging problem as a search/retrieval ranking problem, 2.) We leverage the order of tags, which does not always reflect visual relevance, provided by the user in the past as a cue to their tag preferences, similar to click data, 3.)

abstract={Word representations, aiming to build vectors for each word, have been successfully used in a variety of applications. Most word representations are learned from large amounts of documents ignoring other information. This is rather suboptimal because the side information of the documents, such as document labels, is not used in learning word representations. In this paper, we focus on how to exploit these side information to improve word representations. We propose to incorporate document labels into the learning process of word representations in two frameworks: neural network and matrix factorization. The experimental results on word analogy and word similarity task show that our models can better capture the semantic and syntactic information than the original models. Our models also improve the performance of word representations on text classification task.},

abstract={Nowadays social semantic Web has become one of the most important sources of data. The quality of data is crucial for data integration and annotation in social Linked Open Data (LOD). The main goal of tweets classification and linking is to integrate all tweets that are related semantically in one place on the Web. The data inequality problems exist because authors post tweets and hashtag them based on their own preference. The authors can post tweets in different languages (English-Arabic). Therefore, the hashtags cannot be the only trackback function of the tweet to link it with the related tweets. Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop an automated tweet classifier which is not limited by the language or the category of the tweet. The approach can create new suggested multilingual (English, Arabic) hashtags from tweet's content and comments "auto-tagging" in social linked open data (LOD), matching the tweets in the same topic and provides high accuracy and performance using blocking and indexing techniques. The proposed framework has substantial improvements in tweets classification and linking compared to state of the art framework of classifying and linking techniques with better classifying rate which reach 95% in precision and 97% in recall.},

title={Computationally efficient multi-label classification by least-squares probabilistic classifier},
year={2012},
pages={2077-2080},
abstract={Multi-label classification allows a sample to belong to multiple classes simultaneously, which is often the case in real-world applications such as audio tagging, image annotation, video search, and text mining. In such a multi-label scenario, taking into account correlation between multiple labels can boost the classification accuracy. However, this in turn makes classifier training more challenging because handling multiple labels tends to induce a high-dimensional optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable multi-label classifier based on a computationally efficient classification algorithm called the least-squares probabilistic classifier. Through experiments, we show the usefulness of our proposed method.},

title={Modeling semantic correspondence in heterogeneous structured document collection},
year={2011},
pages={189-196},
abstract={On the web, most structured document collections consist of documents from different sources and marked up with different types of structures. The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness. We introduce a generic and flexible structured document model to represent heterogeneous structured documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections. We also illustrate how the proposed model can be utilized in structured document retrieval.},

title={Analyzing and retrieving illicit drug-related posts from social media},
year={2016},
pages={1555-1560},
abstract={Illicit drug use is a serious problem around the world. Social media has increasingly become an important tool for analyzing drug use patterns and monitoring emerging drug abuse trends. Accurately retrieving illicit drug-related social media posts is an important step in this research. Frequently, hashtags are used to identify and retrieve posts on a specific topic. However hashtags are highly ambiguous. Posts with the same hashtags are not always on the same topic. Moreover, hashtags are evolving, especially those related to illicit drugs. New street names are introduced constantly to avoid detection. In this paper, we employ topic modeling to disambiguate hashtags and track the changes of hashtags using semantic word embedding. Our preliminary evaluation shows the promise of these methods.},
