abstract={Image representation learning is a fundamental problem in understanding semantics of images. However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R<formula><tex>$^{3}$</tex></formula>CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags. IEEE},

abstract={Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) helps image retrieval systems by predicting tags for images. In this paper, we propose an AIA system using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) framework. The NMF framework discovers a latent space, by factorizing data into a set of non-negative basis and coefficients. To model the images, multiple features are extracted, each one represents images from a specific view. We use multi-view graph regularization NMF and allow NMF to choose a different number of basis vectors for each view. For tag prediction, each test image is mapped onto the multiple latent spaces. The distances of images in these spaces are used to form a unified distance matrix. The weights of distances are learned automatically. Then a search-based method is used to predict tags based on tags of nearest neighbors’. We evaluate our method on three datasets and show that it is competitive with the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2017},

abstract={Having benefited from tremendous growth of user-generated content, social annotated tags get higher importance in the organization and retrieval of large-scale image databases on Online Sharing Websites (OSW). To obtain high-quality tags from existing community contributed tags with missing information and noise, tag-based annotation or recommendation methods have been proposed for performance promotion of tag prediction. While images from OSW contain rich social attributes, they have not taken full advantage of rich social attributes and auxiliary information associated with social images to construct global information completion models. In this article, beyond the image-Tag relation, we take full advantage of the ubiquitous GPS locations and image-user relationship to enhance the accuracy of tag prediction and improve the computational efficiency. For GPS locations, we define the popular geo-locations where people tend to take more images as Points of Interests (POI), which are discovered by mean shift approach. For image-user relationship, we integrate a localized prior constraint, expecting the completed tag sub-matrix in each POI to maintain consistency with users' tagging behaviors. Based on these two key issues, we propose a unified tag matrix completion framework, which learns the image-Tag relation within each POI. To solve the optimization problem, an efficient proximal sub-gradient descent algorithm is designed. The model optimization can be easily parallelized and distributed to learn the tag sub-matrix for each POI. Extensive experimental results reveal that the learned tag sub-matrix of each POI reflects the major trend of users' tagging results with respect to different POIs and users, and the parallel learning process provides strong support for processing large-scale online image databases. To fit the response time requirement and storage limitations of Tag-based Image Retrieval (TBIR) on mobile devices, we introduce Asymmetric Locality Sensitive Hashing (ALSH) to reduce the time cost and meanwhile improve the efficiency of retrieval. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The growth of social media and user-created content on online sites provides unique opportunities to study models of human declarative memory. By framing the task of choosing a hashtag for a tweet and tagging a post on Stack Overflow as a declarative memory retrieval problem, 2 cognitively plausible declarative memory models were applied to millions of posts and tweets and evaluated on how accurately they predict a user's chosen tags. An ACT-R based Bayesian model and a random permutation vector-based model were tested on the large data sets. The results show that past user behavior of tag use is a strong predictor of future behavior. Furthermore, past behavior was successfully incorporated into the random permutation model that previously used only context. Also, ACT-R's attentional weight term was linked to an entropy-weighting natural language processing method used to attenuate high-frequency words (e.g., articles and prepositions). Word order was not found to be a strong predictor of tag use, and the random permutation model performed comparably to the Bayesian model without including word order. This shows that the strength of the random permutation model is not in the ability to represent word order, but rather in the way in which context information is successfully compressed. The results of the large-scale exploration show how the architecture of the 2 memory models can be modified to significantly improve accuracy, and may suggest task-independent general modifications that can help improve model fit to human data in a much wider range of domains. © 2015 American Psychological Association.},

It is our aim to shed light on the inuence of these factors on tag reuse. In our experiments, we utilize six datasets from the social tagging systems Flickr, CiteULike, BibSonomy, Delicious, LastFM and MovieLens, covering a range of various tagging settings. Our results conrm that frequency, recency and semantic context positively inuence the reuse probability of tags. However, the extent to which each factor individually inuences tag reuse strongly depends on the type of folksonomy present in a social tagging system. Our work can serve as guideline for researchers and developers of tag-based recommender systems when designing algorithms for social tagging environments. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly important in many real-world applications noticeably including web applications, such as web blogs and resource sharing systems. Despite this importance, tagging methods often face difficult challenges such as limited training samples and incomplete labels, which usually lead to degenerated performance on tag prediction. To improve the generalization performance, in this paper, we propose Regularized Marginalized Cross-View learning (RMCV) by jointly modeling on attribute noise and label noise. In more details, the proposed model constructs infinite training examples with attribute noises from known exponential-family distributions and exploits label noise via marginalized denoising autoencoder. Therefore, the model benefits from its robustness and alleviates the problem of tag sparsity. While RMCV is a general method for learning tagging, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of multi-label text tagging. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that RMCV outstands with a superior performance in comparison with state-of-The-Art methods. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Several expert systems have been proposed to address the sparsity of tags associated with online content such as images and videos. However most of such systems either necessitate extracting domain-specific features, or are solely based on tag semantics, or have significant space requirements to store corpus based tag statistics. To address these shortcomings, in this work we show how ontological tag trees can be used to encode information present in a given corpus pertaining to interaction between the tags, in a space efficient manner. An ontological tag tree is defined as an undirected, weighted tree on the set of tags where each possible tag is treated as a node in the tree. We formulate the tag tree construction as an optimization problem over the space of trees on the set of tags and propose a novel local search based approach utilizing the co-occurrence statistics of the tags in the corpus. To make the proposed optimization more efficient, we initialize using the semantic relationships between the tags. The proposed approach is used to construct tag trees over tags for two large corpora of images, one from Flickr and one from a set of stock images. Extensive data-driven evaluations demonstrate that the constructed tag trees can outperform previous approaches in terms of accuracy in predicting unseen tags using a partially observed set of tags, as well as in efficiency of predicting all applicable tags for a resource. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We show how user metadata (age, gender, etc.) combined with image features derived from a convolutional neural network can be used to perform hashtag prediction. We explore two ways of combining these heterogeneous features into a learning framework: (i) simple concatenation; and (ii) a 3-way multiplicative gating, where the image model is conditioned on the user metadata. We apply these models to a large dataset of de-identified Facebook posts and demonstrate that modeling the user can significantly improve the tag prediction quality over current state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={With the emergence of Web 2.0, tag recommenders have become important tools, which aim to support users in finding descriptive tags for their bookmarked resources. Although current algorithms provide good results in terms of tag prediction accuracy, they are often designed in a data-driven way and thus, lack a thorough understanding of the cognitive processes that play a role when people assign tags to resources. This thesis aims at modeling these cognitive dynamics in social tagging in order to improve tag recommendations and to better understand the underlying processes. As a first attempt in this direction, we have implemented an interplay between individual micro-level (e.g., categorizing resources or temporal dynamics) and collective macrolevel (e.g., imitating other users' tags) processes in the form of a novel tag recommender algorithm. The preliminary results for datasets gathered from BibSonomy, CiteULike and Delicious show that our proposed approach can outperform current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Collaborative Filtering, FolkRank or Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization. We conclude that recommender systems can be improved by incorporating related principles of human cognition.},

abstract={With an increasing number of images that are available in social media, image annotation has emerged as an important research topic due to its application in image matching and retrieval. Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Personalized microblog recommendations face challenges of user cold-start problems and the interest evolution of topics. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on a temporal interest evolution model and social tag prediction. Three matrices are first prepared to model the relationship between users, tags, and microblogs. Then the scores of the tags for each microblog are optimized according to the interest evolution model of tags. In addition, to address the user cold-start problem, a social tag prediction algorithm based on community discovery and maximum tag voting is designed to extract candidate tags for users. Finally, the joint probability of a tag for each user is calculated by integrating the Bayes probability on the set of candidate tags, and the top n microblogs with the highest joint probabilities are recommended to the user. Experiments using datasets from the microblog of Sina Weibo showed that our algorithm achieved good recall and precision in terms of both overall and temporal performances. A questionnaire survey proved user satisfaction with recommendation results when the cold-start problem occurred. © 2015, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Learning to predict multi-label outputs is challenging, but in many problems there is a natural metric on the outputs that can be used to improve predictions.In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric.},

abstract={With the development of social network services (SNS), more and more people exposure their relationships onto SNS platforms, such as Twitter and Weibo. Tag information, which is always added by users themselves, is often adopted to locate people with certain interests or characteristics. However, statistics on practical SNS data show that more than 60% users do not add any tags to themselves. The aim of our work is to predict tags for those none-tagged users so that they can be searched and grouped effectively. In this paper, we first define the problem of predicting tags for none-tagged person. Then a two-stage predicting algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Experimental results based on a dataset with 12.8 million users of Sina weibo show effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. An SNS expert search system named Weibo Xunren (xunren.thuir.org) is also constructed based on the proposed algorithm. © 2014 Binary Information Press.},

By extending the architectural control mechanism of the drowsy cache to predict the cache line read in the next access, the tag prediction wakes up the necessary cache line in advance, while the rest of cache line is in the drowsy mode. Empirical results show that the tag prediction reduces the 77 % power consumption compared to the policy adopting branch prediction, and the accuracy of tag prediction is roughly same with the accuracy of BTB prediction. By removing the BTB and adopting the technique of drowsy cache, the tag prediction effectively reduces the power consumption without significant impact on performance of processors. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The launch of Xbox Kinect has built a very successful computer vision product and made a big impact on the gaming industry. This sheds lights onto a wide variety of potential applications related to action recognition. The accurate estimation of human poses from the depth image is universally a critical step. However, existing pose estimation systems exhibit failures when facing severe occlusion. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based method to learn to correct the initially estimated poses. We learn an inhomogeneous systematic bias by leveraging the exemplar information within a specific human action domain. Furthermore, as an extension, we learn a conditional model by incorporation of pose tags to further increase the accuracy of pose correction. In the experiments, significant improvements on both joint-based skeleton correction and tag prediction are observed over the contemporary approaches, including what is delivered by the current Kinect system. Our experiments for the facial landmark correction also illustrate that our algorithm can improve the accuracy of other detection/estimation systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Tags have been popularly utilized in many applications with image and text data for better managing, organizing and searching for useful information. Tag completion provides missing tag information for a set of existing images or text documents while tag prediction recommends tag information for any new image or text document. Valuable prior research has focused on improving the accuracy of tag completion and prediction, but limited research has been conducted for the efficiency issue in tag completion and prediction, which is a critical problem in many large scale real world applications. This paper proposes a novel efficient Hashing approach for Tag Completion and Prediction (HashTCP). In particular, we construct compact hashing codes for both data examples and tags such that the observed tags are consistent with the constructed hashing codes and the similarities between data examples are also preserved. We then formulate the problem of learning binary hashing codes as a discrete optimization problem. An efficient coordinate descent method is developed as the optimization procedure for the relaxation problem. A novel binarization method based on orthogonal transformation is proposed to obtain the binary codes from the relaxed solution. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve similar or even better accuracy with state-of-the-art methods and can be much more efficient, which is important for large scale applications.

abstract={In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification. © 2013 IEEE.},

The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques - one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel framework is developed for leveraging large-scale loosely tagged images for object classifier training by addressing three key issues jointly: (a) spam tags e.g., some tags are more related to popular query terms rather than the image semantics; (b) loose object tags, e.g., multiple object tags are loosely given at the image level without identifying the object locations in the images; (c) missing object tags, e.g., some object tags are missed and thus negative bags may contain positive instances. To address these three issues jointly, our framework consists of the following key components for leveraging large-scale loosely tagged images for object classifier training: (1) distributed image clustering and inter-cluster visual correlation analysis for handling the issue of spam tags by filtering out large amounts of junk images automatically, (2) multiple instance learning with missing tag prediction for dealing with the issues of loose object tags and missing object tags jointly; (3) structural learning for leveraging the inter-object visual correlations to train large numbers of inter-related object classifiers jointly. Our experiments on large-scale loosely tagged images have provided very positive results. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={Interactive tagging is an approach that combines human and computer to assign descriptive keywords to image contents in a semi-Automatic way. It can avoid the problems in automatic tagging and pure manual tagging by achieving a compromise between tagging performance and manual cost. However, conventional research efforts on interactive tagging mainly focus on sample selection and models for tag prediction. In this work, we investigate interactive tagging from a different aspect. We introduce an interactive image tagging framework that can more fully make use of human's labeling efforts. That means, it can achieve a specified tagging performance by taking less manual labeling effort or achieve better tagging performance with a specified labeling cost. In the framework, hashing is used to enable a quick clustering of image regions and a dynamic multiscale clustering labeling strategy is proposed such that users can label a large group of similar regions each time. We also employ a tag refinement method such that several inappropriate tags can be automatically corrected. Experiments on a large dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={In recent years, several methods have been proposed to exploit image context (such as location) that provides valuable cues complementary to the image content, i.e., image annotations and geotags have been shown to assist the prediction of each other. To exploit the useful interrelatedness between these two heterogeneous prediction tasks, we propose a new correlation guided structured sparse multi-task learning method. We utilize a joint classification and regression model to identify annotation-informative and geotag-relevant image features. We also introduce the tree-structured sparsity regularizations into multi-task learning to integrate the label correlations in multi-label image annotation. Finally we derive an efficient algorithm to optimize our non-smooth objective function. We demonstrate the performance of our method on three real-world geotagged multi-label image data sets for both semantic annotation and geotag prediction. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Visualizing audio signals during playback has long been a fundamental function of music players. However, most visual effects are generated by audio signal processing directly and render meaningless or incomprehensible displays to users. In this paper, we present an intelligent music player called the Playing with Tagging (PWT) music player. By integrating a real-time music tagger, the PWT player can display dynamic tag distributions via a set of tag bars that move in sync with the music. To synchronize the tag distributions, the music tagger must be able to online recognize the music tags. We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played. To evaluate the real-time tagging function, we simulate tag prediction on short music chunks. The results of experiments on the MajorMiner dataset demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed music tagging method. © 2012 IEEE.},

Furthermore, keywords and community-provided tags lack consistency and present numerous irregularities. Addressing the challenge of simplifying and improving the process of tagging online videos, which is potentially not bounded to any particular domain, we present an algorithm for predicting user-tags from the associated textual metadata in this paper. Our approach is centred around extracting named entities exploiting complementary textual resources such as Wikipedia and Wordnet. More specifically to facilitate the extraction of semantically meaningful tags from a largely unstructured textual corpus we developed a natural language processing framework based on GATE architecture. Extending the functionalities of the in-built GATE named entities, the framework integrates a bag-of-articles algorithm for effectively searching through the Wikipedia articles for extracting relevant articles. The proposed framework has been evaluated against MediaEval 2010 Wild Wild Web dataset, which consists of large collection of Internet videos. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The emergence of social tagging systems enables users to organize and share their interested resources. In order to ease the human-computer interaction with such systems, extensive researches have been done on how to recommend personalized tags for rescources. These researches mainly consider user profile, resource content, or the graph structure of users, resources and tags. Users' preferences towards different tags are usually regarded as invariable against time, neglecting the switch of users' short-term interests. In this paper, we examine the temporal factor in users' tagging behaviors by investigating the occurrence patterns of tags and then incorporate this into a novel method for ranking tags. To assess a tag for a user-resource pair, we first consider the user's general interest in it, then we calculate its recurrence probability based on the temporal usage pattern, and at last we consider its tag relevance to the content of the post. Experiments conducted on real datasets from Bibsonomy and Delicious demonstrate that our method outperforms other temporal models and state-of-the-art tag prediction methods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this article, we present a novel algorithm to discover multirelational structures from social media streams. A media item such as a photograph exists as part of a meaningful interrelationship among several attributes, including time, visual content, users, and actions. Discovery of such relational structures enables us to understand the semantics of human activity and has applications in content organization, recommendation algorithms, and exploratory social network analysis. We are proposing a novel nonnegative matrix factorization framework to characterize relational structures of group photo streams. The factorization incorporates image content features and contextual information. The idea is to consider a cluster as having similar relational patterns; each cluster consists of photos relating to similar content or context. Relations represent different aspects of the photo stream data, including visual content, associated tags, photo owners, and post times. The extracted structures minimize the mutual information of the predicted joint distribution. We also introduce a relational modularity function to determine the structure cost penalty, and hence determine the number of clusters. Extensive experiments on a large Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful relational patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate the utility of the discovered structures through a tag prediction task and through a user study. Our results show that our method based on relational structures, outperforms baseline methods, including feature and tag frequency based techniques, by 35%-420%. We have conducted a qualitative user study to evaluate the benefits of our framework in exploring group photo streams. The study indicates that users found the extracted clustering results clearly represent major themes in a group; the clustering results not only reflect how users describe the group data but often lead the users to discover the evolution of the group activity. © 2012 ACM.},

Different approaches may capture different aspects of a song's musical content, such as timbre, temporal dynamics, rhythmic qualities, etc. As a result, some auto-taggers may be better suited to model the acoustic characteristics commonly associated with one set of tags, while being less predictive for other tags. This paper proposes decision-fusion, a principled approach to combining the predictions of a diverse collection of content-based autotaggers that focus on various aspects of the musical signal.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites has created new challenges and opportunities for designers of web items, such as electronics products, travel itineraries, popular blogs, etc. An increasing number of people are turning to online reviews and user-specified tags to choose from among competing items. This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The presence of social networks in complex systems has made networks and community structure a focal point of study in many domains. Previous studies have focused on the structural emergence and growth of communities and on the topics displayed within the network. However, few scholars have closely examined the relationship between the thematic and structural properties of networks. Therefore, this article proposes the Tagger Tag Resource-Latent Dirichlet Allocation-Community model (TTR-LDA-Community model), which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm through an inference mechanism. Using social tagging data from Delicious, this article demonstrates the clustering of active taggers into communities, the topic distributions within communities, and the ranking of taggers, tags, and resources within these communities. The data analysis evaluates patterns in community structure and topical affiliations diachronically. The article evaluates the effectiveness of community detection and the inference mechanism embedded in the model and finds that the TTR-LDA-Community model outperforms other traditional models in tag prediction. This has implications for scholars in domains interested in community detection, profiling, and recommender systems. © 2011 ASIS&T.},

abstract={As the web has grown into an integral part of daily life, social annotation has become a popular manner for web users to manage resources. This method of management has many potential applications, but it is limited in applicability by the cold-start problem, especially for new resources on the web. In this article, we study automatic tag prediction for web pages comprehensively and utilize the predicted tags to improve search performance. First, we explore the stabilizing phenomenon of tag usage in a social bookmarking system. Then, we propose a two-stage tag prediction approach, which is efficient and is effective in making use of early annotations from users. In the first stage, content-based ranking, candidate tags are selected and ranked to generate an initial tag list. In the second stage, random-walk re-ranking, we adopt a random-walk model that utilizes tag co-occurrence information to re-rank the initial list. The experimental results show that our algorithm effectively proposes appropriate tags for target web pages. In addition, we present a framework to incorporate tag prediction in a general web search. The experimental results of the web search validate the hypothesis that the proposed framework significantly enhances the typical retrieval model. © 2011 ASIS&T.},

abstract={One of the primary goals of tag recommendation approaches is to deal with the problem of ambiguity of tags in a folksonomy by helping users to select the most appropriate tag to annotate a resource. We propose in this work, an original approach for tag recommendation applying a link prediction using supervised machine learning. Given a user (target user) and a resource (target resource) the proposed algorithm computes a list of tags best suited for recommending target user to annotate the target resource. It first searches for users similar to the target user. Then a link prediction approach is applied on a temporal sequence of bipartite graphs coding the history of tagging of retrieved similar users. This results in obtaining one or more lists of tags for the target resource or similar resources. These lists are then merged using a list aggregation method to get a single list of tags for recommendation. The first prototype of this approach is described in this article. Preliminary results of applying the proposed approach to real dataset extracted from the bibliographical folksonomy CiteULike show the validity of the approach. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between hepatic triacylglycerol content (TAG) and hepatic size and shape assessed by transcutaneous ultrasonography in dairy cows. In a second part, the usefulness of ultrasonographic measurements pertaining to the size and shape of the liver for the diagnosis of fatty liver was evaluated. Transcutaneous ultrasonographic examination of the liver was carried out in 133 German Holstein cows (BW: 578 ± 6 kg; age: 5 ± 0.2 yr; withers height: 145 ± 0.3 cm). The size of the liver, angle of the ventral liver margin, and thickness of the liver over the portal vein and caudal vena cava were measured in the 10th and 11th intercostal spaces via ultrasonography. As the gold standard, TAG was determined enzymatically in liver biopsies. Hepatic TAG ranged from 5 to 292 mg/g of liver fresh weight (FW). Cows were allocated to 4 groups according to their hepatic TAG content (TAG ≥150 mg/g of FW, n = 32; ≥100 to 150 mg/g of FW, n = 34; ≥50 to 100 mg/g of FW, n = 38; &lt;50 mg/g of FW, n = 29). Weak to moderate correlations (r = 0.26 to 0.49) between the ultrasonographic liver measurements and hepatic TAG indicated an increased size and angle of the liver with increasing hepatic fat accumulation. All mean liver ultrasonographic measurements revealed differences between TAG classes (P &lt; 0.001), with the greatest values in cows with hepatic TAG concentrations ≥150 mg/g of FW. Stepwise multiple linear regression for hepatic TAG prediction (r 2 = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001) and stepwise discriminant analysis used only ultrasonographic measurements obtained via the 10th intercostal space and age. Regression analysis revealed that TAG prediction widely overestimated measured TAG in the low TAG range and underestimated TAG in the high TAG range. The sensitivity and specificity based on discriminant analysis for differentiation of the TAG groups were 0.61 and 0.61 (&lt;50 vs. ≥50 mg/g of FW), 0.67 and 0.71 (&lt;50 vs. ≥100 mg/g of FW), 0.83 and 0.82 (&lt;50 vs. ≥150 mg/g of FW), 0.70 and 0.77 (&lt;100 vs. ≥100 mg/g of FW), and 0.83 and 0.85 (&lt;100 vs. ≥150 mg/g of FW), respectively. Results revealed that with a hepatic TAG content of approximately 100 mg/g of FW, the liver increased in size and its margins became rounded. Pronounced increases in the size and thickness of the liver and in the angle of the liver occurred only in cows with very severe fatty liver (TAG ≥150 mg/g of FW). However, the determination of ultrasonographic measurements of liver size and shape appeared to be of limited diagnostic value in the recognition of fatty liver because of increased interindividual variance in dairy cows. © 2011 American Society of Animal Science.

We evaluate covariance in spectral features as an alternative to means and variances in cepstral features (particularly MFCCs) as summaries of frame-level features. We find that spectral covariance is more effective than mean, variance, and covariance statistics of MFCCs for genre and social tag prediction. Support for our model comes from strong and state-of-the-art performance on the GTZAN genre dataset, MajorMiner, and MagnaTagatune.

abstract={Social tagging systems have become increasingly popular for sharing and organizing web resources. Tag recommendation is a common feature of social tagging systems. Social tagging by nature is an incremental process, meaning that once a user has saved a web page with tags, the tagging system can provide more accurate predictions for the user, based on the user's incremental behavior. However, existing tag prediction methods do not consider this important factor, in which their training and test datasets are either split by a fixed time stamp or randomly sampled from a larger corpus. In our temporal experiments, we perform a time-sensitive sampling on an existing public dataset, resulting in a new scenario which is much closer to "real-world". In this paper, we address the problem of tag prediction by proposing a probabilistic model for personalized tag prediction. The model is a Bayesian approach, and integrates three factors - an ego-centric effect, environmental effects and web page content. Two methods - both intuitive calculation and learning optimization - are provided for parameter estimation. Pure graph-based methods which may have significant constraints (such as every user, every item and every tag has to occur in at least p posts) cannot make a prediction in most "real world" cases while our model improves the F-measure by over 30% compared to a leading algorithm on a publicly-available real-world dataset. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic generative model, called Topic-Perspective Model, for simulating the generation process of social annotations. Different from other generative models, in our model, the tag generation process is separated from the content term generation process. While content terms are only generated from resource topics, social tags are generated by resource topics and user perspectives together. The proposed probabilistic model can produce more useful information than any other models proposed before. The parameters learned from this model include: (1) the topical distribution of each document, (2) the perspective distribution of each user, (3) the word distribution of each topic, (4) the tag distribution of each topic, (5) the tag distribution of each user perspective, (6) and the probabilistic of each tag being generated from resource topics or user perspectives. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better generalization performance or tag prediction ability than other two models proposed in previous research. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The aim was to test the accuracy of calibrated digital analysis of ultrasonographic hepatic images for diagnosing fatty liver in dairy cows. Digital analysis was performed by means of a novel method, computer-aided ultrasound diagnosis (CAUS), previously published by the authors. This method implies a set of pre- and postprocessing steps to normalize and correct the transcutaneous ultrasonographic images. Transcutaneous hepatic ultrasonography was performed before surgical correction on 151 German Holstein dairy cows (mean ± standard error of the means; body weight: 571±7kg; age: 4.9±0.2 yr; DIM: 35±5) with left-sided abomasal displacement. Concentration of triacylglycerol (TAG) was biochemically determined in liver samples collected via biopsy and values were considered the gold standard to which ultrasound estimates were compared. According to histopathologic examination of biopsies, none of the cows suffered from hepatic disorders other than hepatic lipidosis. Hepatic TAG concentrations ranged from 4.6 to 292.4mg/g of liver fresh weight (FW). High correlations were found between the hepatic TAG and mean echo level (r=0.59) and residual attenuation (ResAtt; r=0.80) obtained in ultrasonographic imaging. High correlation existed between ResAtt and mean echo level (r=0.76). The 151 studied cows were split randomly into a training set of 76 cows and a test set of 75 cows. Based on the data from the training set, ResAtt was statistically selected by means of stepwise multiple regression analysis for hepatic TAG prediction (R2=0.69). Then, using the predicted TAG data of the test set, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to summarize the accuracy and predictive potential of the differentiation between various measured hepatic TAG values, based on TAG predicted from the regression formula. The area under the curve values of the receiver operating characteristic based on the regression equation were 0.94 (&lt;50 vs ≥50mg of TAG/g of FW), 0.83 (&lt;100 vs ≥100mg of TAG/g of FW), and 0.97 (&lt;50 vs ≥100mg of TAG/g of FW). The CAUS methodology and software for digitally analyzing liver ultrasonographic images is considered feasible for noninvasive screening of fatty liver in dairy herd health programs. Using the single parameter linear regression equation might be ideal for practical applications. © 2010 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Image annotation is an important computer vision problem where the goal is to determine the relevance of annotation terms for images. Image annotation has two main applications: (i) proposing a list of relevant terms to users that want to assign indexing terms to images, and (ii) supporting keyword based search for images without indexing terms, using the relevance estimates to rank images. In this paper we present TagProp, a weighted nearest neighbour model that predicts the term relevance of images by taking a weighted sum of the annotations of the visually most similar images in an annotated training set. TagProp can use a collection of distance measures capturing different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, and global colour histograms. It automatically finds the optimal combination of distances to define the visual neighbours of images that are most useful for annotation prediction. TagProp compensates for the varying frequencies of annotation terms using a term-specific sigmoid to scale the weighted nearest neighbour tag predictions. We evaluate different variants of TagProp with experiments on the MIR Flickr set, and compare with an approach that learns a separate SVM classifier for each annotation term. We also consider using Flickr tags to train our models, both as additional features and as training labels. We find the SVMs to work better when learning from the manual annotations, but TagProp to work better when learning from the Flickr tags. We also find that using the Flickr tags as a feature can significantly improve the performance of SVMs learned from manual annotations. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Different approaches based on content or tag information have been proposed to address the problem of tag recommendation for a web page. In this paper, we analyze two approaches in a graph of web pages. Each node is a web page and edges represent hyperlinks. The first approach uses the content while the second one uses tag information in the graph. The second approach makes two assumptions about the tag set of two interacting nodes. The Tag Similarity Assumption claims that two interacting nodes discuss about rather similar topics; therefore, the chance of having more similar tag set is higher. The Tag Collaboration Assumption says that two interacting nodes complement each others topics. We apply algorithms such as Self Organizing Map (SOM), Reinforcement Learning (RL) and K-means clustering to compare methods on several datasets. We conclude that tag-based tag predictors outperform their content-based peers by more than ten percent with respect to the cosine similarity between predicted and actual tag sets.},

abstract={We investigate tag and query logs to see if the terms people use to annotate websites are similar to the ones they use to query for them. Over a set of URLs, we compare the distribution of tags used to annotate each URL with the distribution of query terms for clicks on the same URL. Understanding the relationship between the distributions is important to determine how useful tag data may be for improving search results and conversely, query data for improving tag prediction. In our study, we compare both term frequency distributions using vocabulary overlap and relative entropy. We also test statistically whether the term counts come from the same underlying distribution. Our results indicate that the vocabulary used for tagging and searching for content are similar but not identical. We further investigate the content of the websites to see which of the two distributions (tag or query) is most similar to the content of the annotated/searched URL. Finally, we analyze the similarity for different categories of URLs in our sample to see if the similarity between distributions is dependent on the topic of the website or the popularity of the URL.

abstract={Recently, social tag recommendation has gained more attention in web research, and many approaches were proposed, which can be classified into two types: rule-based and classification-based approaches. However, too much expert experience and manual work are needed in rule-based approaches, and its generalization is limited. Additionally, there are some essential barriers in classification-based approaches, since tag recommendation is transformed into a multi-classes classification problem, such as tag collection is not fixed. Different from them, ranking model is more suitable, in which supervised learning can be used. In additions, the whole tag recommendation task can be divided into 4 subtasks according to the existence of users and resources. In different subtasks, different features are constructed, in order that existed information can be used sufficiently. The experimental results show that the proposed supervised ranking model performs well on the training and test dataset of RSDC 2008 recovered by ourselves.},

abstract={Image auto-annotation is an important open problem in computer vision. For this task we propose TagProp, a discriminatively trained nearest neighbor model. Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Many songs in large music databases are not labeled with semantic tags that could help users sort out the songs they want to listen to from those they do not. If the words that apply to a song can be predicted from audio, then those predictions can be used both to automatically annotate a song with tags, allowing users to get a sense of what qualities characterize a song at a glance. Automatic tag prediction can also drive retrieval by allowing users to search for the songs most strongly characterized by a particular word. We present a probabilistic model that learns to predict the probability that a word applies to a song from audio. Our model is simple to implement, fast to train, predicts tags for new songs quickly, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on annotation and retrieval tasks. © 2009 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Topic-oriented search engine (topic-search) is a new IR service which provides compounded types of information with certain user queried topic in one page. It firstly categorizes user query into a certain domain, and then organizes several types of information based on the query keywords into a magazine-style topic page for user. In this paper, we propose a Chinese topic-oriented search engine service, named as Foxinfo1.0, which provides a 360 degree view of the topic that interests the users who're seeking it. Different from the original topic-search which employs the keyword-based topic to retrieve and aggregate relevant information, Foxinfo1.0 could organize information from different abstraction level by employing tag to describe the topics of queries and information. Further, in order to predict tags from queries and web documents, a tag prediction algorithm named as CTAG is proposed, which could concern tags from different levels, and performs much better than the baseline method like AutoTag. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Online social networking sites such as Flickr and Facebook provide a diverse range of functionalities that foster online communities to create and share media content. In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Concept labeling and ontology-free tagging are the two typical manners of image annotation. Despite extensive research efforts have been dedicated to labeling, currently automatic image labeling algorithms are still far from satisfactory, and meanwhile manual labeling is rather labor-intensive. In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity. Experiments are conducted on different datasets and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ©2009 IEEE.},

For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags.

We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy). © 2008 IEEE.},

The experiments show that a large potion of the stabilized tag set is predicted, and it is feasible to reduce the requirement of sufficient user annotations in the applications of social annotations. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Many on-line photo sharing systems allow users to tag their images so as to support semantic image search. In this paper, we study how one can take advantages of the already-tagged images to (semi-)automate the labeling of newly uploaded ones. In particular, we propose a hybrid approach for the prediction where user-provided tags and image visual contents are fused under a unified probabilistic framework. Kernel smoothing and collaborative filtering techniques are explored for improving the accuracy of the probabilistic models estimation. By comparing with some state-of-the-art content-based image labeling methods, we have empirically shown that 1) the proposed method can achieve comparable tag prediction accuracy when there is no user-provided tag, and that 2) it can significantly boost the prediction accuracy if the user can provide just a few tags. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Bloom Filters are a technique to reduce the effects of conflicts/ interference in hash table-like structures. Conventional hash tables store information in a single location which is susceptible to destructive interference through hash conflicts. A Bloom Filter uses multiple hash functions to store information in several locations, and recombines the information through some voting mechanism. Many microarchitectural predictors use simple single-index hash tables to make binary 0/1 predictions, and Bloom Filters help improve predictor accuracy. However, implementing a true Bloom Filter requires k hash functions, which in turn implies a k-ported hash table, or k sequential accesses. Unfortunately, the area of a hardware table increases quadratically with the port count, increasing costs of area, latency and power consumption. We propose a simple but elegant modification to the Bloom Filter algorithm that uses banking combined with special hash functions that guarantee all hash indexes fall into non-conflicting banks. We evaluate several applications of our Banked Bloom Filter (BBF) prediction in processors: BBF branch prediction, BBF load hit/miss prediction, and BBF last-tag prediction. We show that BBF predictors can provide accurate predictions with substantially less cost than previous techniques. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In our previous work we introduced a hybrid, GA&ILP-based approach for learning of stem-suffix segmentation rules from an unmarked list of words. Evaluation of the method was made difficult by the lack of word corpora annotated with their morphological segmentation. Here the hybrid approach is evaluated indirectly, on the task of tag prediction. A pair of stem-tag and suffix-tag lexicons is obtained by the application of that approach to an annotated lexicon of word-tag pairs. The two lexicons are then used to predict the tags of unseen words in two ways, (1) by using only the stem and suffix generated by the segmentation rules, and (2) for all matching combinations of stem and suffix present in the lexicons. The results show high correlation between the constituents generated by the segmentation rules, and the tags of the words in which they appear, thereby demonstrating the linguistic relevance of the segmentations produced by the hybrid approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1999.},
