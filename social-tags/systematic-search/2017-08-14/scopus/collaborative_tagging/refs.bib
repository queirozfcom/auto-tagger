abstract={Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Information extraction relevant to the user queries is the challenging task in the ontology environment due to data varieties such as image, video, and text. The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of the file systems today are based on desktop metaphor utilizing hierarchies of folders and sub-folders for information storage and retrieval. A folder is usually assumed to store the semantically related information in the form of files and sub-folders. However, there always exist related files somewhere else in the local file system hierarchy. Users often fail to find these disconnected files or discover the relationship among these. File systems maintain a plain set of metadata items about each file which could be utilized to discover some of the hidden relationships. However, this meta-information is very sparse as most of this metadata is rarely entered by the user. Moreover, files in a file system are mostly private and cannot get the benefit of collaborative tagging. Web of Data, on the other hand also contains information related to the file system objects which could be utilized for linking with information in file systems. The purpose of introducing Linked Data technology was to solve similar issues on the web. This article investigates the exploitation of Linked Data technology in file systems and provides a comprehensive review on the possible use of Linked Data Technology in file systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The scale of the social web has integrated users in order to organize shared resources. Users freely associate keywords (tags) to resources. This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Alongside the enormous volume of user-generated content posted to World Wide Web, there exists a thriving demand for search personalization services, especially those utilizing collaborative tagging data. To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Recommender systems allow the exploration of large collections of products, the discovery of patterns in the products, and the guidance of users towards products that match their interests. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label products in a collection using a free vocabulary. The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users. This experience showed that TagProfiles are easier to understand and modify by users, allowing them to discover new movies as they interact with their profiles.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging which is the keystone of the social practices of web 2.0 has been highly developed in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

abstract={Massive amounts of data are available on social websites, therefore finding the suitable item is a challenging issue. According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user’s preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={With the explosive growth of user-generated multimedia resources in the big data era (e.g., video, audio, text or even their combinations), bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics in multiple modes of data is a critical and indispensable issue. In this paper, we exploit a popular type of metadata called collaborative tags to address this issue. Specifically, we identify basic level concepts and then construct ontologies from the collaborative tags. The generated ontologies can be employed to organize and index user-generated multimedia data. Existing research lacks a principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human perspective. In contrast, we borrow the idea of a family of concepts called basic level concepts from cognitive psychology. These basic level concepts are frequently used by people in their daily life and when organizing human knowledge. In this paper, we extract ontologies with basic level concepts from collaborative tags. Furthermore, we model the effect of context and present a method for context-aware basic level concepts detection for ontology learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on context-aware basic level concept detection in collaborative tagging for the construction of ontologies. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were conducted on real datasets using the Open Directory Project (ODP) as a benchmark. The experimental results illustrate that ontologies extracted by our approach are more rational and human-oriented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Folksonomies – large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by independent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing information. In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

abstract={Personalized service recommendation becomes increasingly essential because of the growing number of services. To enhance the performance of personalized service recommendation in collaborative tagging systems, not only tag information but also time and social relations information should be considered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method aiming at taking advantage of tag, time and users' social relations information for a preferable service recommendation. We first improve a simple tag-based recommendation method by a time-decay function. Then we develop a temporal social-based recommendation method which analyzes user familiarity and user preference similarity between friends. Based on these two steps we integrate them as a temporal tag-and social-based (TTS) recommendation algorithm. Experiment results indicate that our method outperforms general tag-based and social-based recommendation methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, like Mendeley, CiteULike, and BibSonomy, users can post, tag, visit, or export scholarly publications. In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage points. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={With the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies, folksonomy which is also known as social tagging or collaborative tagging is widely used by learners to annotate and categorize their learning resources. In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, have grown in popularity over the Web on account of their simplicity to organize several types of content (e.g., Web pages, pictures, and video) using open-ended tags. The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems. Current recommendation approaches stemming from fields such as user modeling, collaborative filtering, content, and link-analysis are reviewed and discussed to provide a starting point for researchers in the field as well as explore future research lines. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Tagging (or bookmarking) online resources with representative keywords is one of the most popular and practical approaches for giving identity to the objects. Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD. CODer Entrepreneurs in the automatically formed communities can dynamically improve identity of the entrepreneurial objects related to their expertise or interests.},

abstract={As an example of exploring human memory cue use in an ecologically valid context, we present ongoing work to examine the “memory cue hypothesis” in collaborative tagging. In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Web 2.0 communities, there has been a tremendous increase in user-generated content. Confronting such a vast volume of resources in collaborative tagging systems, users require a novel method for fast exploring and indexing so as to find their desired data. To this end, contextual information is indispensable and critical in understanding user preferences and intentions. In sociolinguistics, context can be classified as verbal context and social context. Compared with verbal context, social context requires not only domain knowledge to build pre-defined contextual attributes but also additional user data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed the issue of irrelevant contextual factors for the verbal context model. To bridge this gap, the dominating set obtained from verbal context is proposed in this paper. We present (i) the verbal context graph to model contents and interrelationships of verbal context in folksonomy and thus capture the user intention; (ii) a method of discovering dominating set that provides a good balance of essentiality and integrality to de-emphasize irrelevant contextual factors and to keep the major characteristics of the verbal context graph; and (iii) a revised ranking method for measuring the relevance of a resource to an issued query, a discovered context and an extracted user profile. The experimental results obtained for a public dataset illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than existing baseline approaches. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of user-generated data in collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy-based) systems due to the prevailing of Web 2.0 communities. To effectively assist users to find their desired resources, it is critical to understand user behaviors and preferences. Tag-based profile techniques, which model users and resources by a vector of relevant tags, are widely employed in folksonomy-based systems. This is mainly because that personalized search and recommendations can be facilitated by measuring relevance between user profiles and resource profiles. However, conventional measurements neglect the sentiment aspect of user-generated tags. In fact, tags can be very emotional and subjective, as users usually express their perceptions and feelings about the resources by tags. Therefore, it is necessary to take sentiment relevance into account into measurements. In this paper, we present a novel generic framework SenticRank to incorporate various sentiment information to various sentiment-based information for personalized search by user profiles and resource profiles. In this framework, content-based sentiment ranking and collaborative sentiment ranking methods are proposed to obtain sentiment-based personalized ranking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of integrating sentiment information to address the problem of the personalized tag-based search in collaborative tagging systems. Moreover, we compare the proposed sentiment-based personalized search with baselines in the experiments, the results of which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we study the influences by popular sentiment dictionaries, and SenticNet is the most prominent knowledge base to boost the performance of personalized search in folksonomy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Whether traditional TV or Internet multimedia content, parental control systems based on the intermediate filtering criteria of broadcasters or content producers may be not flexible enough. From parent’s perspective, the ideal scenario would be one in which they could dynamically decide about the suitability of any content. Since this desired scenario entails many practical problems, we propose an intermediate solution where parents delegate the decision of blocking any piece of TV content on a trustworthy set of parents. Our approach provides a collaborative parental control model based on two pillar: (1) a parenting social network where parents interact, freely give their opinion about TV content and tag this content (collaborative tagging); and (2) a model of trust relationship between parents. Regarding the deployment of parental control, we introduce a parental monitoring system for DVB-IPTV content, which is based on social technologies. The proposal combines information from the service provider and from parents in a social network to predict whether content should be blocked. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Social bookmarking and tagging has emerged a new era in user collaboration. Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users' Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

A method based on the tripartite model (actors, concepts and instances) induces from social applications a folksonomy related to a domain of knowledge. The hypothesis of this paper is that if folksonomies are shared conceptualizations, then using them in conceptual modeling should reduce the number of divergences between actors when they elicit terms to be part of a model (a concept map in this article). A controlled experiment of conceptual modeling was performed with experimental groups who received tags inducted from data of categorizations from Delicious and control groups who received terms extracted from Web pages categorized on Delicious. The results show that the experimental groups obtained less divergences (on average) in elicitation of terms when compared to control groups. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We study how categories form and develop over time in a sensemaking task by groups of students employing a collaborative tagging system. In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

Task-oriented dialogue aims the solution of a given task in a given domain. Folksonomies are knowledge structures composed of users, tags and resources. Folksonomies emerge from the tagging process in collaborative tagging systems. Dialogues and folksonomies have in common their social dimension. One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process. This can be useful for instance, to retrieve the topics addressed by the interlocutors of the dialogues, in different time intervals.

abstract={Social tags take an important role in exploratory search. In collaborative tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources with tags. The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Tourist Spot Recommender Systems (TSRS) help users to find the interesting locations/spots in vicinity based on their preferences. Enriching the list of recommended spots with contextual information such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts etc. may further add value to the systems. This paper proposes the concept of information enrichment for a tourist spot recommender system. Proposed system works in collaboration with a Tourist Spot Recommender System, takes the list of spots to be recommended to the current user and collects the current contextual information for those spots. A new score/rank is computed for each spot to be recommender based on the recommender’s rank and current context and sent back to the user. Contextual information may be collected by several techniques such as sensors, collaborative tagging (folksonomy), crowdsourcing etc. This paper proposes an approach for information enrichment using just in time location aware crowdsourcing. Location aware crowdsourcing is used to get current contextual information about a spot from the crowd currently available at that spot. Most of the contextual parameters such as traffic conditions, weather conditions, crowdedness etc. are fuzzy in nature and therefore, fuzzy inference is proposed to compute a new score/rank, with each recommended spot. The proposed system may be used with any spot recommender system, however, in this work a personalized tourist spot recommender system is considered as a case for study and evaluation. A prototype system has been implemented and is evaluated by 104 real users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Providing better travel services for tourists is one of the important applications in urban computing in the world of peregrination, enjoyment, entertainment, and internet technology are linked. Here it provides a study of utilizing online travel information for the Customized travel package recommendation. However many recommender systems have been cultivated for boosting the characteristic of travel utility. Tourist Relation Area Season Topic Model is enhanced by using n-way search, this method has the capacity of finding the nearest places beyond the consumer search and hence it supports effective information for creating the packages. Tourist relation area season topic model is used as an effective evaluation for travel group formation also satisfies the consumer by suggesting recommend package. Hybrid recommendation strategy is followed to produce an efficient results to the travelers and collaborative method which detects the nearest places and conclude the expenses for the suggested places, here the data are semantically classified where the raw information is obtained by service composition function. Composition retrieves small services from a huge number of services. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Recommender systems these days have changed the way people search for new items, information, and even other person on social networking. Recommender systems look for pattern of behavior of users to know what that particular user will prefer from catalogue of items he has never experienced before. Evolution of the technology behind recommender systems has taken place from the past 20 years. This paper proposed a hybrid recommender system for research papers, which can be used as the alternative to the current systems. This system is hybridization of content filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. This system based on bottom up approach to classify research papers i.e. users can tag their papers with their own keywords. This system uses the content and collaborative filtering techniques along with author analysis, date analysis and title analysis. This system also optimized the retrieved results by using collaborative approaches like user to item techniques and item to item technique. The proposed system has also addressed the cold start problem for the new items. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for measuring semantic similarity. Semantic similarity measures are important for various semantics-oriented natural language processing tasks, such as Textual Entailment or Word Sense Disambiguation. In the paper, a folksonomy graph is used to determine the relatedness of two words. The construction of a folksonomy from a collaborative photo tagging resource is described. The problems which occur during the process are analyzed and solutions are proposed. The structure of the folksonomy is also analyzed. It turns out to be a social network graph. Graph features, such as the path length, or the Jaccard similarity coefficient, are the input parameters for a machine learning classifying algorithm. The comparative importance of the parameters is evaluated. Finally, the method was evaluated in the RUSSE evaluation campaign. The results are lower than most results for distribution-based vector models. However, the model itself is cheaper to build. The failures of the models are analyzed and possible improvements are suggested.},

To make informed decisions, shared knowledge should be managed in a way to be accessible for relevant group members to each of the contents. One of the main factors that contribute to the quality of contents recommendations to the relevant users is the quality of the users and contents identification. A variety of automatic and semi-automatic methods exist for extracting or assigning identity to online resources. Although users’ perception about contents and also their interests might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects and always recommend them to the users based on their fixed, defined identities because they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our approach, we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of users related to them in a social semantic tagging system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique (Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution), which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy (expressed in a FO) to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. © 2015 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Centro de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnológico. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, most social Websites allow users to annotate resources (such as Web pages and images) with keywords, i.e. tags. Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social tagging, also noted as collaborative tagging or folksonomy, is an important way for users themselves to describe resources on the Web. The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Taggers in social tagging systems have the main role in giv- ing identities to the objects. Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects. Be- cause our perceptions in each specific area of knowledge is evolving over time, the goal of our approach is also to evolve the represented knowledge in semantic tagging systems dy- namically according to the latest perception of the related users. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

abstract={With the advent of the so-called "Web 2.0", the participatory nature of many of its applications has nurtured the vision of many researchers to finally overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck inherent to many Semantic Web applications. Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

abstract={Compared with learning in classrooms, classical e-learning systems are less adaptive and once a system that supports a particular strategy has been designed and implemented, it is less likely to change according to student's interactions and preferences. Remote educational systems should be developed to ensure as much as necessary the personalization of learning tasks. New e-learning environments should appear to act as intelligent systems that better fit the needs of their users and especially students according to their interests, preferences, motivations, objectives and knowledge. In this paper, we present how the personalization of students' learning process leveraging the use of social semantic web, using resource description framework models, ontologies, social networking and collaborative tagging. Our aim is to develop an approach of personalization according to students' preferences, interests and knowledge by defining for them the best learning paths, this means, provide them as recommendations the best collaborators and the relevant resources that better fit their needs. We present a new method of recommendation based on users' similarity calculation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the design, implementation, analysis and evaluation of a social learning environment. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

One of the challenging issues in this area is to successfully understand customers' affective needs and to interpret it in terms of product design elements. Previous studies have attempted to obtain customer's affective needs using manual approaches, e.g. survey, which is time-consuming and a costly process. In relation, the study for such a need is usually limited to a number of product features only. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative tagging approach for discovering product features, affective description and their associations from product review analysis. Specifically, we have discussed on the tagging task assignment, tags aggregation and performance analysis of our proposal. A case study on discovering feature-affective associations from car reviews is reported to showcase the feasibility of our approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract: Collaborative labeling portrays the process by which numerous users put in metadata in the form of keywords to shared data. Nowadays, collaborative labeling has grown in reputation on the web, on sites that permit users to label bookmarks, photographs and other details. It has been recently become useful and well known as one effective way of classifying items for future search, sharing information, and filtering. So, as to predict the future search of users, we propose a novel collaborative tagging-based page recommendation algorithm using fuzzy classifier. The method consists of three phases: Grouping, Rule Generation Phase and Page Recommendation Phase. In the proposed method, we calculate the resemblance of users in selecting tags and thereby, calculate the nearest neighbors of each user and cluster them. Then, the priority of tags and items for each user is calculated for constructing a Nominal Label Matrix and Nominal Page Matrix. Finally, the fuzzy rules are generated for page recommendation. The experimentation is carried out on delicious datasets and the experimental results ensured that the proposed algorithm has achieved the maximum hit ratio of 6.6% for neighborhood size of 20, which is higher than the existing technique which obtained only 5.5%. © 2014, Copyright: the authors.},

abstract={The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three components, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this paper, we develop a dual mining framework to explore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design four sets of efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article discusses the information representation process based on the Moscovici's Social Representation Theory and domain analysis in Information Science. The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the dataset, showed that the users' reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants - in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user's choice of resources, and sharing styles. Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a "gain scale" of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.},

abstract={Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the increase in resource-sharing websites such as YouTube and Flickr, many shared resources have arisen on the Web. Personalized searches have become more important and challenging since users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized searches need to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provides a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized searches. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in collaborative tagging systems. We use a normalized term frequency to indicate the preference degree of a user on a tag. A novel search method using such profiles of users and resources is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource searches. In our framework, instead of the keyword matching or similarity measurement used in previous works, the relevance measurement between a resource and a user query (termed the query relevance) is treated as a fuzzy satisfaction problem of a user's query requirements. We implement a prototype system called the Folksonomy-based Multimedia Retrieval System (FMRS). Experiments using the FMRS data set and the MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These 'social taxonomies', which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions -from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique - Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution -, which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy - expressed in a FO - to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In the era of big data, collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems have proliferated as a consequence of the growth of Web 2.0 communities. Constructing user profiles from folksonomy systems is useful for many applications such as personalized search and recommender systems. The identification of latent user communities is one way to better understand and meet user needs. The behavior of users is highly influenced by the behavior of their neighbors or community members, and this can be utilized in constructing user profiles. However, conventional user profiling techniques often encounter data sparsity problems as data from a single user is insufficient to build a powerful profile. Hence, in this paper we propose a method of enriching user profiles based on latent user communities in folksonomy data. Specifically, the proposed approach contains four sub-processes: (i) tag-based user profiles are extracted from a folksonomy tripartite graph; (ii) a multi-faceted folksonomy graph is constructed by integrating tag and image affinity subgraphs with the folksonomy tripartite graph; (iii) random walk distance is used to unify various relationships and measure user similarities; (iv) a novel prototype-based clustering method based on user similarities is used to identify user communities, which are further used to enrich the extracted user profiles. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a public dataset, the results of which show that our approach outperforms previous ones in user profile enrichment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A folksonomy is ostensibly an information structure built up by the "wisdom of the crowds", but is the "crowd" really doing the work? Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Background: The public typically believes psychotherapy to be more effective than pharmacotherapy for depression treatments. This is not consistent with current scientific evidence, which shows that both types of treatment are about equally effective. Objective: The study investigates whether this bias towards psychotherapy guides online information search and whether the bias can be reduced by explicitly providing expert information (in a blog entry) and by providing tag clouds that implicitly reveal experts' evaluations. Methods: A total of 174 participants completed a fully automated Web-based study after we invited them via mailing lists. First, participants read two blog posts by experts that either challenged or supported the bias towards psychotherapy. Subsequently, participants searched for information about depression treatment in an online environment that provided more experts' blog posts about the effectiveness of treatments based on alleged research findings. These blogs were organized in a tag cloud; both psychotherapy tags and pharmacotherapy tags were popular. We measured tag and blog post selection, efficacy ratings of the presented treatments, and participants' treatment recommendation after information search. Results: Participants demonstrated a clear bias towards psychotherapy (mean 4.53, SD 1.99) compared to pharmacotherapy (mean 2.73, SD 2.41; t173=7.67, P<.001, d=0.81) when rating treatment efficacy prior to the experiment. Accordingly, participants exhibited biased information search and evaluation. This bias was significantly reduced, however, when participants were exposed to tag clouds with challenging popular tags. Participants facing popular tags challenging their bias (n=61) showed significantly less biased tag selection (F2,168=10.61, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.112), blog post selection (F2,168=6.55, P=.002, partial eta squared=0.072), and treatment efficacy ratings (F2,168=8.48, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.092), compared to bias-supporting tag clouds (n=56) and balanced tag clouds (n=57). Challenging (n=93) explicit expert information as presented in blog posts, compared to supporting expert information (n=81), decreased the bias in information search with regard to blog post selection (F1,168=4.32, P=.04, partial eta squared=0.025). No significant effects were found for treatment recommendation (Ps>.33). Conclusions: We conclude that the psychotherapy bias is most effectively attenuated-and even eliminated-when popular tags implicitly point to blog posts that challenge the widespread view. Explicit expert information (in a blog entry) was less successful in reducing biased information search and evaluation. Since tag clouds have the potential to counter biased information processing, we recommend their insertion. © Holly O Witteman.},

abstract={Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this article, a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns, and to enrich each individual profile by a two-phase profile enrichment procedure. The profiles are extended by association rules discovered through the association rule mining process.

abstract={With the development of the Internet, there are more and more shared resources on the Web. Personalized search becomes increasingly important as users demand higher retrieval quality. Personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags (features) and thus provide a powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. To capture and understand user preferences, a user is typically modeled as a vector of tag:value pairs (i.e., a tag-based user profile) in collaborative tagging systems. In such a tag-based user profile, a user's preference degree on a group of tags (i.e., a combination of several tags) mainly depends on the preference degree on every individual tag in the group. However, the preference degree on a combination of tags (a tag-group) cannot simply be obtained from linearly combining the preference on each tag. The combination of a user's two favorite tags may not be favorite for the user. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To overcome their problems, we model a user profile based on combinations of tags (tag-groups) and then apply it to the personalized search. By comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results on a real data set shows the effectiveness of our proposed user profile method.

Historically, the popular song has been classified as a subcategory of other musical objects. However, recent researches show that the popular song is a specific artistic form that is endowed with its own language and, therefore, demands specific techniques for analysis, representation and, consequently, classification. Considering the different approaches toward popular songs in catalogues and contemporary systems, this paper identifies possible solutions, such as the use of descriptive metadata, the use of collaborative tagging or the creation of an ontology. In discussing the construction of an epistemological foundation used specifically for classifying the popular song, we reflect on the remaining challenges for the knowledge organization of complex artistic documents.},

abstract={Recently collaborative tagging, also known as "folksonomy" in Web 2.0, allows users to collaboratively create and manage tags to classify and categorize dynamic content for searching and sharing. A user's interest in social resources usually changes with time in such a dynamic and information rich environment. Additionally, a social network is one innovative characteristic in social resource sharing websites. The information from a social network provides an inference of a certain user's interests based on the interests of this user's network neighbors. To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user's social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the "social friends" network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system's performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user's preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

abstract={With the proliferation of social media, it is becoming important to support a significant amount of user tags in selecting the most appropriate resource description during the search process. In this paper, we propose to identify and structure the links between resources by taking into account a resource social dimension. Each resource is assigned to a cluster of tags hierarchy. The clusters of tags are formed by a classification method while the hierarchical classification of tags within clusters is defined using a hierarchy classification algorithm. User's query is expanded by a social dimension and the clusters of tags are used to facilitate the search and ranking process. The results of our experiment, crawled from Delicious Folksonomy, demonstrate significant improvement over traditional retrieval approaches. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content sites has created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions on various items such as e-commerce products, restaurants, etc. Ideally, a user wants to quickly decide whether an item is desirable, from the list of items returned as a result of her search query. This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular way to organize content. But sometimes it is also used as a way to express opinions, which is normally done through rating-or text review systems. This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the (offine) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from dificulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks have become a popular medium for people to communicate and distribute ideas, content, news, and advertisements. Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

A Rules Engine is used to manage a set of rules for each user to achieve personalized recommendation. The rules which define the relationship between tags construct the relationship graph model for users and learning resources thus graph-based collaborative filtering recommendation methods can be implemented.

abstract={With the rapid growth of web 2.0 technologies, tagging become much more important today to facilitate personal organization and also provide a possibility for users to search information or discover new things with Collaborative Tagging Systems. However, the simplistic and user-centered design of this kind of systems cause the task of finding personally interesting users is becoming quite out of reach for the common user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation. This is because CF always been attack by malicious users that will make it suffers in finding the truly interesting users. With this problem in mind, this study proposes a hybrid User Trust method to enhance CF in order to increase accuracy of user recommendation in social tagging system. This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. In addition, it indicated that the hybrid method give more accurate recommendation than the existing CF based on user trust. © 2013 Science Publications.},

Moreover, only the matching degree of a tag with another tag is calculated, while the effects of tags as a whole on the user's preference are ignored. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on the tag-group effect, namely, TGER. This algorithm utilizes the user ratings on resources to select the tag-groups which have significant effects on the user's preference, and adopts the high-dimension tag-group first matching method to calculate the user-resource relevance. Experimental results on the MovieLens data set show that TGER can significantly improve the recommendation quality.},

abstract={Graphs are a fundamental data structure and have been employed to model objects as well as their relationships. The similarity of objects on the web (e.g., webpages, photos, music, micro-blogs, and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects in many recent applications. SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N 2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O.n/.},

A number of models of tagging behaviour have been proposed to identify factors that are considered to affect taggers, such as users' tagging history. In this paper, we use Semiotics Analysis and Activity theory, to study the effect the system designer has over tagging behaviour. The framework we use shows the components that comprise the tagging system and how they interact together to direct tagging behaviour. We analysed two collaborative tagging systems: CiteULike and Delicious by studying their components by applying our framework. Using datasets from both systems, we found that 35% of CiteULike users did not provide tags compared to only 0.1% of Delicious users. This was directly linked to the type of tools used by the system designer to support tagging.},

abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, such as web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Ontologies, folksonomy and personomy are employed in KAM to constitute the useful repositories of knowledge. Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction, very useful for capturing the semantics of information repositories, but they can not reflect the user's interest. The user in KAM can freely choose the words to tag the resources which are the reflection of the user's own interest. The set of tags and tagged knowledge of a user comprise the personomy. In a group the shared tags and knowledge are known as folksonomy. Our approach investigates how to map these tags in personomy and folksonomy to existing domain ontology in order to add accurate meanings. The user's behaviors are also used to re-rank the query results. So the user can find the useful knowledge quickly and accurately.},

abstract={Some of the most remarkable innovative technologies from the Web 2.0 are the collaborative tagging systems. They allow the use of folksonomies as a useful structure for a number of tasks in the social web, such as navigation and knowledge organization. One of the main deficiencies comes from the tagging behaviour of different users which causes semantic heterogeneity in tagging. As a consequence a user cannot benefit from the adequate tagging of others. In order to solve the problem, an agent-based reconciliation knowledge system, based on Formal Concept Analysis, is applied to facilitate the semantic interoperability between personomies. This article describes experiments that focus on conceptual structures produced by the system when it is applied to a collaborative tagging service, Delicious. Results will show the prevalence of shared tags in the sharing of common resources in the reconciliation process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={As a storage and retrieval unit of user generated web objects, set has been receiving increased attention recently in information retrieval research community. Set search requires relevant sets to be retrieved to meet information needs of users. It is different from individual object search in terms of content granularity. While a web object itself is not divisible and independent with each other, a set consists of separable objects that are related in some aspects. This paper proposes a new approach that can effectively measure topical relevance of sets against a user query by utilizing the tags attached to web objects. The main idea of the proposed approach is to prefer the set which covers as many query related subtopics as possible. In particular, in order to compute the topical relevance while addressing the problem of noisy tags, the notion of tag significance score is introduced based on tag co-occurrence frequency. We consider a problem domain of photo set search at flickr.com where individual photos are annotated with texts such as titles and tags. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous approaches for photo set retrieval. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Tagging is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 web sites. A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as a common solution for labelling and organising online digital content. However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a semantically enhanced tag-based approach to music recommendation. While most of approaches to tag-based recommendation are based on tag frequency, our approach is based on semantics of tags. In order to extract semantics of tags, we developed the emotion ontology for music called UniEmotion, which categorizes tags into positive emotional tags, negative emotional tags, and factual tags. According to the types of the tags, their weights are calculated and assigned to them. After then, user profiles using the weighted tags were generated and a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm was executed. To evaluate our approach, a data set of 1,100 users, tags which they added, and artists which they listened to was collected from last.fm. The conventional track-based recommendation, the unweighted tag-based recommendation, and the weighted tag-based recommendation are compared in terms of precision. Our experimental results show that the weighted tag-based recommendation outperforms other two approaches in terms of precision. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Background: Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. Objective: The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. Methods: First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. Results: Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the so-called Web 2.0 has changed the surfers' behavior. A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={While recommendation approaches exploiting different input sources have started to proliferate in the literature, an explicit study of the effect of the combination of heterogeneous inputs is still missing. On the other hand, in this context there are sides to recommendation quality requiring further characterisation and methodological research - a gap that is acknowledged in the field. We present a comparative study on the influence that different types of information available in social systems have on item recommendation. Aiming to identify which sources of user interest evidence - tags, social contacts, and user-item interaction data - are more effective to achieve useful recommendations, and in what aspect, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering, and social recommenders on three datasets obtained from Delicious, Last. fm, and MovieLens. Aiming to determine whether and how combining such information sources may enhance over individual recommendation approaches, we extend the common accuracy-oriented evaluation practice with various metrics to measure further recommendation quality dimensions, namely coverage, diversity, novelty, overlap, and relative diversity between ranked item recommendations. We report empiric observations showing that exploiting tagging information by content-based recommenders provides high coverage and novelty, and combining social networking and collaborative filtering information by hybrid recommenders results in high accuracy and diversity. This, along with the fact that recommendation lists from the evaluated approaches had low overlap and relative diversity values between them, gives insights that meta-hybrid recommenders combining the above strategies may provide valuable, balanced item suggestions in terms of performance and non-performance metrics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={While research on collaborative tagging systems has largely been the purview of computer scientists, the behavior of these systems is driven by the psychology of their users. Here we explore how simple models of boundedly rational human decision making may partly account for the high-level properties of a collaborative tagging environment, in particular with respect to the distribution of tags used across the folkson-omy. We discuss several plausible heuristics people might employ to decide on tags to use for a given item, and then describe methods for testing evidence of such strategies in real collaborative tagging data. Using a large dataset of annotations collected from users of the social music website Last.fm with a novel crawling methodology (approximately one millions total users), we extract the parameters for our decision-making models from the data. We then describe a set of simple multi-agent simulations that test our heuristic models, and compare their results to the extracted parameters from the tagging dataset. Results indicate that simple social copying mechanisms can generate surprisingly good fits to the empirical data, with implications for the design and study of tagging systems.},

abstract={Tags can be used to annotate resources on the web. This enables users to share or browse the resources or retrieve them in future. Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to describe and organize items using labels in a free-shared vocabulary (tags), improving their browsing experience in large collections of items. At present, the most accurate collaborative filtering techniques build user profiles in latent factor spaces that are not interpretable by users. In this paper, we propose a general method to build linear-interpretable user profiles that can be used for user interaction in a recommender system, using the well-known simple additive weighting model (SAW) for multi-attribute decision making. In experiments, two kinds of user profiles where tested: one from free contributed tags and other from keywords automatically extracted from textual item descriptions. We compare them for their ability to predict ratings and their potential for user interaction. As a test bed, we used a subset of the database of the University of Minnesota's movie review system-Movielens, the social tags proposed by Vig et al. (2012) in their work "The Tag Genome", and movie synopses extracted from the Netflix's API. We found that, in "warm" scenarios, the proposed tag and keyword-based user profiles produce equal or better recommendations that those based on latent-factors obtained using matrix factorization. Particularly, the keyword-based approach obtained 5.63% of improvement. In cold-start conditions-movies without rating information, both approaches perform close to average. Moreover, a user profile visualization is proposed arising an accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff between tag and keyword-based profiles. While keyword-based profiles produce more accurate recommendations, tag-based profiles seems to be more readable, meaningful and convenient for creating profile-based user interfaces.

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions-from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E steps technique-Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution-which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy-expressed in a FO-to support ontology review and enhancement.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular tools for Web search users to find their desired information. Indeed, the informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. The widely keyword-based approaches used for locating information on the Web, are hence not straightforwardly adaptable to folksonomies. This drawback has created the need for an effective framework to support folksonomy users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this paper is to propose an integrated approach for context-aware query recommendation infolksonomies that exploits the power of both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and triadic concepts. We demonstrate through carried out experiments that the proposed approach yields mainly highly Precise and highly Relevant tag query recommendation.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the growth patterns of tag vocabulary in collaborative tagging systems to verify the sustainability and stabilization of tag distributions. Both sustainability and stabilization are essential to the mining and categorization of information driven by tagging behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on time series data of CiteULike from November 2004 to April 2010. Power law distributions were detected to reveal statistical regularities and tagging patterns. Logistic regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted to identify the factors affecting the growth of distinct tags for articles. The significance of the effects and the time taken for a given article to reach its tagging maturity were also explored. Findings - Time series plots and trend analysis illustrated the continuous growth of the tagging system. Exploratory analysis of power law distribution fittings indicated a sign of system stability known as scale invariance. Logistic regression results demonstrated that for a particular article, the number of users who tagged the article, the initial date when the article was tagged, and the life span of the article are statistically significant to the ratio of the distinct tag number to the total tag number for a given article. These results confirmed that the distinct tag ratio of an article gives rise to a stable pattern. Originality/value - Though extensive work has been done on the patterns of tag vocabulary, it is not clear how the growth of distinctive tags behaves in relation to the total number of tag applications, considering time-dependent covariates such as the number of users, and the longevity of an article. This paper sets to complement the literature on the existing methodology and investigate this property in detail. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Social Web makes visible the ebb and flow of popular interest in topics both newsworthy (\GulfSpill") and trivial (\Lolcat"). Understanding this emergent behavior is a fun- damental goal for Social Web research. Key problems in- clude discovering emergent topics from online text sources, modeling burst activity, and predicting the future trajec- tory of a given topic. Past work has addressed such prob- lems individually for specific applications, but has lacked a generalizable framework for performing both classification and prediction of topic usage. Our approach is to model a topic as a temporally ordered sequence of derived feature states and capture characteristic changes in the topic trend. These sequences are drawn from a dynamic segmentation of frequency data based on change point analysis. We employ Partitioning Around Medoids clustering on these segments to produce signatures which highlight characteristic patterns of usage growth and decay. We demonstrate how this signa- ture model can be used to define distinctive classes of topics in multiple online contexts, including tagging systems and web-based information retrieval. Additionally, we show how the model can predict the general trajectory of interest in a particular topic. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Many software engineering tasks, such as feature location and duplicate bug report detection, leverages similarities among textual corpora. However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Originally introduced by social bookmarking systems, collaborative tagging, or social tagging, has been widely adopted by many web-based systems like wikis, e-commerce platforms, or social networks. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={A new collaborative approach in information organization and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI), which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric. The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree. The results of this study can be applicable to the study of filtering social tags based on CI; filtered social tags may be utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as an efficient way to semantically describe online resources shared by a community of users. However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users. We analyze the performance of two probabilistic approaches to recommend tags from users with similar tagging behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={As the number of Web services dramatically increases, it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for user to find the desired Web services. Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between cooccurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases, where a dimension is a set of mutually exclusive itemsets. The problem we consider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying on information-theoretic concepts, we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity, and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard, and we propose a greedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is equipped with strategies for pruning the search space deriving directly from the objective function. We also prove a property that allows assessing the level of informativeness for newly added dimensions, thus allowing to define criteria for terminating the decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets with known dimension and three real-world datasets, flickr, del. icio. us and dblp. The problem we study is largely motivated by applications in the domain of collaborative tagging; however, the mining task we introduce in this paper is useful in other application domains as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is attracting a growing community in the arts museums as manifested by several initiatives such as the Steve Museum project and the Posse initiative at the Brooklyn Museum. The driving force for these projects is the quest for increased and improved access to artifact collections such as art collections. Previous results of studying the nature of tags provided by users reveal that these tags have little overlap with museum documentation; but on the other hand, there is good overlapping with terms from vocabulary sources such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). This paper reports a case study that we performed where the aim was to include tags provided by "average" users from the broader community, not necessarily closely related to the art field as it was the focus of the previous studies. The study we performed comparing tags generated by average users, expert users and metadata seems to indicate the unique role that tags provided by average users would play in facilitating the interaction with art digital libraries. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Folksonomies have shown to contain information that is beneficial for resource recommendation. However, as folksonomies are not designed to support recommendation tasks, there are drawbacks of the various recommendation techniques. Graphbased recommendation in folksonomies for example suffers from the problem of concept drift. Vector space based recommendation approaches in folksonomies suffer from sparseness of available data. In this paper, we propose the exible framework VSScore which incorporates context-specific information into the recommendation process to tackle these issues. Additionally, as an alternative to the evaluation methodology LeavePostOut we propose an adaptation Leave- RTOut for resource recommendation in folksonomies. In a subset of resource recommendation tasks evaluated, the proposed recommendation framework VSScore performs signifi cantly more effective than the baseline algorithm FolkRank.

Yokie uses the large volume of hyperlink-laden messages on social networks like Twitter as the basis of its content and ranking systems. Curated sets of users (or "Search Parties") form the basis of sourcing the content from the networks, and the metadata of the containing messages form the basis of ranking and contextual retrieval of the hyperlinks. Each hyperlink is indexed with a compound set of terms from multiple tweets (should the given hyperlink be shared more than once). This indexing step is a novel example of collaborative tagging of resources. The application is live with more than 100 users, who have performed approximately 1000 queries.

abstract={With ubiquitous access to Web 2.0 applications, users on social networks can now collaboratively author and share hypermedia learning resources, contributing to more engaging learning experiences in Technology-Enhanced Learning outside formal education. Though these resources are ready to be harnessed for educational purposes, they may or may not be educational or may be suitable for some users only. Hence, it is crucial to annotate these resources to personalize these resources to different user needs. We propose to annotate learning resources with folksonomy-derived description metadata for personalization to context profiles of users. A semantic model for folksonomy was formulated to integrate controlled vocabularies in folksonomy. It not only reduces reliance on domain experts in annotating learning resources but also opens new avenues for more comprehensive resource description, compared to numerical ratings in resource recommendation algorithm. The working principle of the resource annotation and recommendation mechanism is demonstrated via a prototype system implemented in a social network environment. A pilot user study shows that learners are positive about the system in terms of aspects apart from accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Popular Internet document repositories, such as online newspapers, digital libraries, and blogs store large amount of text and image data that are frequently accessed by large number of users. Users' input through collaborative commenting or tagging can be very useful in organizing and classifying documents. Some web sites (e.g. Google Image Labeler) support a collection of tags and labels, but a large fraction of these sites do not currently support such activities. Moreover, relying upon centrally controlled web-service providers for such support is probably not a good idea if the objective is to make the collaborative inputs publicly available. Often, business entities offering such web-based tagging environments end up owning and monetizing the result of the collective effort. This paper takes a step toward addressing this problem-it proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (PADMINI), powered by distributed data mining algorithms. In particular, it focuses on learning a P2P classifier from tagged text data. This paper describes the PADMINI system and the distributed text classifier learning components; text classification is posed as a linear program and an asynchronous distributed algorithm is used to solve it. It also presents extensive empirical results on text data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proposal abstract database. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

More precisely, we propose a multi-layer framework where data collected by social tagging communities are complemented with additional services. Such services provide users the ability of expressing their dis/agreement with existing tags, denoting the members they trust based on their characteristics and relationships, or specifying policies on which "quality" assessment of resources should be returned. Besides providing the formal specification of the proposed framework, we illustrate two case studies we have implemented and the experiments we have carried out in order to verify the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites, facilitating ordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i. e., Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Social or collaborative tagging systems emerged as a novel classification scheme on the Web based on the collective knowledge of people. In sites such as Del.icio.us, Technorati or Flickr, users annotate a variety of resources, including Web pages, blogs, pictures, videos or bibliographic references; using freely chosen textual labels or tags. Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web. In this paper we present an empirical study carried out to determine the value of tags in resource classification. Furthermore, the use of several filtering and pre-processing operations to reduce the ambiguity and noise in tags are analyzed to determine whether they allow to increase the quality of resource classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this manuscript we present a method that leverages social media for the effortless learning of object detectors. We are motivated by the fact that the increased training cost of methods demanding manual annotation, limits their ability to easily scale in different types of objects and domains. At the same time, the rapidly growing social media applications have made available a tremendous volume of tagged images, which could serve as a solution for this problem. However, the nature of annotations (i.e. global level) and the noise existing in the associated information (due to lack of structure, ambiguity, redundancy, and emotional tagging), prevents them from being readily compatible (i.e. accurate region level annotations) with the existing methods for training object detectors. We present a novel approach to overcome this deficiency using the collective knowledge aggregated in social sites to automatically determine a set of image regions that can be associated with a certain object. We study theoretically and experimentally when the prevailing trends (in terms of appearance frequency) in visual and tag information space converge into the same object, and how this convergence is influenced by the number of utilized images and the accuracy of the visual analysis algorithms. Evaluation results show that although the models trained using leveraged social media are inferior to the ones trained manually, there are cases where the user contributed content can be successfully used to facilitate scalable and effortless learning of object detectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We use this methodology for evaluating how tag recommendations coming from (1) the popular tags at a resource or from (2) the user's own vocabulary influence the indexing quality. We show that recommending popular tags decreases the indexing quality and that recommending the user's own vocabulary increases the indexing quality. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Therefore, the techniques used in traditional information retrieval systems do not meet the requirements of users who want to take into account their social preferences. The idea reported in this paper is about including not only the social context of the user but also the one for the resource. In the social network that we consider, the user social context brings its interests, which are captured from a collaborative tagging system, while the resource social context is related to clusters of tags, obtained by classification method, and users' opinions according to their expertise level on the resource. The results of our experiment evaluation on real-world datasets (crawled from delicious folksonomy) demonstrate significant improvements over traditional retrieval approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

In order to analyze and compare these initiatives we present here an abstract framework. It supports our argument that existing approaches do not explore the full potential of the combination between folksonomies and ontologies due to their unidirectionality. The framework is also the basis to evidence that a fusion approach - -as proposed in our "folksonomized ontology" - -enables to better explore the organic semantics of folksonomies combined to the engineered semantics of ontologies. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging platforms allow users to describe resources with freely chosen keywords, so called tags. The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={We demonstrate the Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tagging systems (also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items from a public pool of items (e.g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a query should be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers' search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully-personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. In this paper an intelligent tag recommendation agent is proposed, that recommends tags for bookmarks stored in one of the popular social bookmarking websites, Del.ici.ou.1 We develop various probabilistic approaches to recommend tags to be used by users while adding new bookmarks. We have developed content-based and collaborative filtering mechanism that are used by these recommendation agents. Additionally, these tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. This approach can therefore be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for social networks. We also empirically verify the hypothesis that similar web pages are tagged with similar tags. We also present a comparison between the proposed recommendation approaches for the agents. © 2012 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Due to the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, the research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other related concepts is becoming an important interdisciplinary area with great potential and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely 'flat', while in some cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags. However, usually no overall hierarchical organization of the tags is given, and one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there are also other types of tagged networks available for research, where the tags are already organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the 'is a sub-category of' type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper, we study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes marked by the tags in various real networks. The motivation for this research was the fact that understanding the tagging based on a known hierarchy can help in revealing the hidden hierarchy of tags in collaborative tagging systems.We analyse the relation between the tagfrequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG (i.e. their rank or significance as characterized by, e.g., the length of the branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features of tag co-occurrence. This model has high potential for further practical applications, e.g., it can provide the starting point for a benchmark system in ontology retrieval or it may help pinpoint unusual correlations in the co-occurrence of tags. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging have emerged as a ubiquitous way to annotate and organize online resources. As a kind of descriptive keyword, large amount of tags are created and associated to multiple types of resources, e. g., web pages, photos, videos and tweets. Users' tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing the temporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web. Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However, there exist remarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect bursty tagging event, which captures the relations among a group of correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It profiles the events with more representative and comprehensible clues. The proposed approach is divided into three stages. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events. We discuss the choice of similarity and granularity for event detection. After that, we further utilize an automatically generated tag taxonomy to organize bursty events to facilitate the burst oriented navigation and analysis. The experimental study on a large real data set demonstrates the superiority of our new approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Recommender Systems are non-profit websites to predict user preferences. In Commercial websites predicting accurate data may result higher selling rates.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommender systems. These methods are based on collecting and analyzing the information of a particular user behavior, activity, preferences and will predict the user's interest according to the similarity of other users. In this paper we address the problem of scalability associated with CF and propose a CF framework that combines collaborative tagging with genre interestingness measure for a movie RS. Our experiments on each movie dataset with recent timestamp demonstrate that the proposed CFT -GIM gives more accurate predictions of user's ratings as compared to both CF and CFT.},

abstract={We propose a semantic collaborative filtering method to enhance recommendation quality derived from user-generated tags. Social tagging is employed as an approach in order to grasp and filter users' preferences for items. In addition, we explore several advantages of semantic tagging for ambiguity, synonymy, and semantic interoperability, which are notable challenges in information filtering. The proposed approach first determines semantically similar users using social tagging and subsequently discovers semantically relevant items for each user. Experimental results show that our method offers significant advantages both in terms of improving the recommendation quality and in dealing with ambiguity, synonymy, and interoperability issues. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Turning Web services into Semantic Web Services (SWS) can be prohibitively expensive for large repositories. In such cases collecting community descriptions in forms of structured tags can be a more affordable approach to describe Web services. However, little is understood about how tagging impacts performance of retrieval. There are neither real structured tagging systems for Web services, nor real corpora of structured tags. To start addressing these issues, in our approach, we motivated taggers to tag services in a partially controlled environment. Specifically, taggers were given application requirements and asked to find and tag services that match the requirements. Tags collected in this way were used for Web service matchmaking and evaluated within the framework of the Cross-Evaluation Track of the Third Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest. As part of the lessons learned, we explain relations between description schema (SWS, tags, flat document) and matchmaking heuristics, and performance of retrieval in different search scenarios. We also analyze reliability of tagging system performance as related to taggers/searchers autonomy. Finally, we identify threats to results credibility stemming from partial control of the tags collection process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={The cross-sections of the Social Web and the Semantic Web has put folksonomy in the spot light for its potential in overcoming knowledge acquisition bottleneck and providing insight for "wisdom of the crowds". Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

abstract={In recent years, there is a fast proliferation of collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems in Web 2.0 communities. With the increasingly large amount of data, how to assist users in searching their interested resources by utilizing these semantic tags becomes a crucial problem. Collaborative tagging systems provide an environment for users to annotate resources, and most users give annotations according to their perspectives or feelings. However, users may have different perspectives or feelings on resources, e.g., some of them may share similar perspectives yet have a conflict with others. Thus, modeling the profile of a resource based on tags given by all users who have annotated the resource is neither suitable nor reasonable. We propose, to tackle this problem in this paper, a community-aware approach to constructing resource profiles via social filtering. In order to discover user communities, three different strategies are devised and discussed. Moreover, we present a personalized search approach by combining a switching fusion method and a revised needs-relevance function, to optimize personalized resources ranking based on user preferences and user issued query. We conduct experiments on a collected real life dataset by comparing the performance of our proposed approach and baseline methods. The experimental results verify our observations and effectiveness of proposed method. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

Libraries and other information environments hope that tagging can complement professional subject access with user-created terms. But who are the taggers, and does their language represent that of the user population? Some language theorists believe that inherent variables, such as gender or race, can be responsible for language use, whereas other researchers endorse more multiply-influenced practice-based approaches, where interactions with others affect language use more than a single variable. To explore whether linguistic variation in tagging is influenced more by gender or context, in this exploratory study, I will analyze the content and quantity of tags used on LibraryThing.

abstract={When large groups work on a theme, they have the potential to produce a lot of useful knowledge, regardless of whether they are acting in a coordinated manner or individually. Spontaneously generated information has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. New technologies, such as blogs, Twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, enable the creation and dissemination of content in a relatively simple way. As a result, the aggregate body of knowledge is growing at an accelerated rate. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Research has shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. Research has shown that individuals respond quickly and massively to emergencies, and that they try to help with the situation. Thus, it seems like a logical step to attempt to harness collective knowledge for emergency management. Disaster relief groups and field command frequently suffer from lack of up to date information, which may be critical in a rapidly evolving situation. Some of this information could be generated by the crowd at large, enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for the introduction of collective knowledge in disaster relief and present architecture and examples of how this could be accomplished. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As the collaborative tagging systems such as Delicious, Flickr and Last.fm become more and more popular, a large amount of resources produced by publishers, together with rich semantic metadata, become available. There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Information representation in engineering design is currently dominated by top-down approaches such as taxonomies and ontologies. While top-down approaches provide support for computational reasoning, they are primarily limited due to their static nature, limited scope, and developer-centric focus. Bottom-up approaches, such as folksonomies, are emerging as means to address the limitations of top-down approaches. Folksonomies refer to collaborative classification by users who freely assign tags to design information. They are dynamic in nature, broad in scope, and are user focused. However, they are limited due to the presence of ambiguities and redundancies in the tags used by different people. Considering their complementary nature, the ideal approach is to use both top-down and bottom-up approaches in a synergistic manner. To facilitate this synergy, the goal in this paper is to present techniques for using dynamic folksonomies to extract global characteristics of the structure of design information, and to create hierarchies of tags that can guide the development of structured taxonomies and ontologies. The approach presented in this paper involves using (a) tools such as degree distribution and K-neighborhood connectivity analysis to extract the global characteristics of folksonomies and (b) set-based technique and hierarchical clustering to develop a hierarchy of tags. The approach is illustrated using data from a collective innovation platform that supports collaborative tagging for design information. It is shown that despite the flat nature of the folksonomies insights about the hierarchy in information can be gained. The effects of various parameters on the tag hierarchy are discussed. The approach has potential to be used synergistically with top-down approaches such as ontologies to support the next generation collaborative design platforms. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

However, how to help users conduct high quality resource retrieval remains a challenge and should be considered first for an e-learning system. The traditional indexing approach which classifies multimedia resources into predefined categories can hardly meet user demands.

Moreover, feedbacks made by users can be utilized to refine the retrieval results during the interactive process between users and systems.

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tagabstrcatsness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of wordabstrcatness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and Wikitaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data.},

abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases. A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive itemsets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and del.icio.us, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the popularity of collaborative tagging services and systems, the role of social tags in information organization and retrieval has become increasingly critical within the tagging system. Consequently, the resolution of semantic ambiguity of tag sense (i.e., meaning) plays an important role in the enhancement of information organization and retrieval in collaborative tagging applications. Our approach to tackle the task of automatic resolution of semantic ambiguity is based on the hypothesis that given a target tag, some of the co-occurring social tags that were selectively assigned by the same or by different people to the same resource can serve as a useful dataset. Four different methods (i.e., two LSA-based, LIN-based, and Cooccurrence method) for tag sense disambiguation are proposed and their results are compared, aiming to automatically rank the senses associated with a given target tag. The experimental results with a Delicious dataset indicate that LSA-w and LIN-based methods produce more stable performances, and suggest the same two methods for the Tag Sense Disambiguation task, particularly in the situation that the Boolean effect is more likely to arise.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging services provided by various social web sites become popular means to mark web resources for different purposes such as categorization, expression of a preference and so on. However, the tags are of syntactic nature, in a free style and do not reflect semantics, resulting in the problems of redundancy, ambiguity and less semantics. Current tag-based recommender systems mainly take the explicit structural information among users, resources and tags into consideration, while neglecting the important implicit semantic relationships hidden in tagging data. In this study, we propose a Semantic Enhancement Recommendation strategy (SemRec), based on both structural information and semantic information through a unified fusion model.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

abstract={Collaborative tagging or social bookmarking is a main component of Web 2.0 systems and has been widely recognized as one of the key technologies underpinning next-generation knowledge management platforms. In this article, we propose a subject-centered model of collaborative tagging to account for the ternary cooccurrences involving users, items, and tags in such systems. Extending the well-established probabilistic latent semantic analysis theory for knowledge representation, our model maps the user, item, and tag entities into a common latent subject space that captures the "wisdom of the crowd" resulted from the collaborative tagging process. To put this model into action, we have developed a novel way to estimate the probabilistic subject- centeredmodel approximately in a highly efficient manner taking advantage of amatrix factorization method. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed approach delivers substantial performance improvement on the knowledge resource recommendation task over the state-of-the-art standard and tag-aware resource recommendation algorithms. © 2011 ACM.},

A set of descriptive tags has to be manually entered by users whenever they post a resource. This process can be simplified by the use of tag recommendation systems. Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been widely adopted by social media websites to allow users to describe content with metadata tags. Tagging can greatly improve search results. We propose a cross-language social media retrieval system (CLSMR) to help users retrieve foreign-language tagged media content. We construct a Chinese to Korean CLSMR system that translates Chinese queries into Korean, retrieves content, and then translates the Korean tags in the search results back into Chinese. Our system translates NEs using a dictionary of bilingual NE pairs from Wikipedia and a pattern-based software translator which learns regular NE patterns from the web. The top-10 precision of YouTube retrieved results for our system was 0.39875. The K-C NE tag translation accuracy for the top-10 YouTube results was 77.6%, which shows that our translation method is fairly effective for named entities. A questionnaire given to users showed that automatically translated tags were considered as informative as a human-written summary. With our proposed CLSMR system, Chinese users can retrieve online Korean media files and get a basic understanding of their content with no knowledge of the Korean language. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites has created new challenges and opportunities for designers of web items, such as electronics products, travel itineraries, popular blogs, etc. An increasing number of people are turning to online reviews and user-specified tags to choose from among competing items. This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The 'Collaborative Tagging' is gaining popularity on Web 2.0, this new generation of Web which makes user reader/writer. The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

This forms a quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings. Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

abstract={Video summarisation is one of the most active fields in content-based video retrieval research. A new video summarisation scheme is proposed by this paper based on socially generated temporal tags. To capture users' collaborative tagging activities the proposed scheme maintains video bookmarks, which contain some temporal or positional information about videos, such as relative time codes or byte offsets. For each video all the video bookmarks collected from users are then statistically analysed in order to extract some meaningful key frames (the video equivalent of keywords), which collectively constitute the summary of the video. Compared with traditional video summarisation methods that use low-level audio-visual features, the proposed method is based on users' high-level collaborative activities, and thus can produce semantically more important summaries than existing methods. It is assumed that the video frames around the bookmarks inserted by users are informative and representative, and therefore can be used as good sources for summarising videos. Folksonomy, commonly called collaborative tagging, is a Web 2.0 method for users to freely annotate shared information resources with keywords. It has mostly been used for collaboratively tagging photos (Flickr), web site bookmarks (Del.icio.us), or blog posts (Technorati), but has never been applied to the field of automatic video summarisation. It is believed that this is the first attempt to utilise users' high-level collaborative tagging activities, instead of low-level audio-visual features, for video summarisation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={In this article, we discuss the notions of experts and expertise in resource discovery in the context of collaborative tagging systems. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. First, an expert should possess a high-quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource in turn depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it, forming a mutual reinforcement relationship. Second, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users discover them, thus bringing these resources to the attention of the community of users. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (spamming-resistant expertise analysis and ranking), which implements the above ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. Our experiments show that our assumptions on expertise in resource discovery, and SPEAR as an implementation of these ideas, allow us to promote experts and demote spammers at the same time, with performance significantly better than the original hypertext-induced topic search algorithm and simple statistical measures currently used in most collaborative tagging systems. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a distributed systems and Web Services Architecture that supports a content management and collaborative tagging system for a Webbased cultural heritage site. The site uses Formal Concept Analysis to infer semantic associations between objects and drive the navigation of its collection, and we promote an extension of its capability by rendering such functionality via Web Services. The Web Services architecture supports a system called the Virtual Museum of the Pacific - a content and knowledge acquisition tool that permits the machine synthesis of formal concepts and provides a Rich Internet Application in which to display and navigate them. The Web Services also permit the extensible association of digital objects by inducing new attributes and relationships from museum meta-data, and allows for the ability for users and stakeholders to upload, annotate and attach rich media, YouTube or Vimeo links, and voice narratives to the objects. By rendering these capabilities as an open API, we encourage a connected and open approach to the sharing of cultural heritage and provide platform for further research and development - making our application well suited for mobile devices, Web-based mashups, and data exchange between collection databases. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tag abstractness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of word abstractness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and WikiTaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

By leveraging social tagging, we propose a new personalized search method to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. Our approach first determines the similarities between resources and between tags. Thereafter, we build two models: a user-tag relation model that reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and a tag-item relation model that captures how a certain tag has been tagged to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly map the tags on the items depending on a particular user's query in order to find the most attractive media content relevant to the user needs. The experimental evaluations have shown the proposed method achieves better search results than state-of-the art algorithms in terms of accuracy and coverage. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably, the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the noise. Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with three-mode tensors, in order to capture the three-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multiway analysis, latent correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Moreover, a hybrid scheme is proposed that additionally considers content-based information that is extracted from items. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Last.fm), against both recent tag-aware and traditional (non tag aware) item recommendation algorithms indicates significant improvements in recommendation quality. Moreover, the experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid scheme. © 2011 IEEE.},

The results of the study show that tags enhance individuals' ability to remember the viewed meals.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is the practice of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize online content. Current collaborative tagging activities within medical blogs are done using free words chosen by users. These tags are not based on standard medical terminologies. The resulted tags are inefficient in terms of medical meanings and semantic interlinking capabilities. In this paper, MTag is presented as a new model for collaborative tagging in medical blogs, i.e. tagging blog entries with medical information. MTag includes two modules: the service module and the semantic module. The service module enables health professionals provide blog posts with auto-completed tags that represent actual medical terms and categorize their tags. Tags are mapped to URIs from online medical knowledge datasets to clarify their medical meaning. At the same time, the semantic module is equipped with a tag ontology which extends the Social Semantic Cloud of Tags (SCOT) ontology to consent medical specifications of tags. Eventually, a prototype is developed to test the MTag's two modules. The results show that both modules are working properly. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Folksonomy and tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. The concepts are organized as a map in human mind, however, the tags in folksonomy, which reflect users' collaborative cognition on information, are isolated with current approach. What we do in this paper is to estimate the semantic relatedness among tags in folksonomy: whether tags are related from semantic view, rather than isolated? We introduce different algorithms to form networks of folksonomy, connecting tags by users collaborative tagging, or by resource context. Then we perform multiple measures of semantic relatedness on folksonomy networks to investigate semantic information within them. The result shows that the connections between tags have relatively strong semantic relatedness, and the relatedness decreases dramatically as the distance between tags increases. What we find in this paper could provide useful visions in designing future folksonomy-based systems, constructing semantic web in current state of the Internet, and developing natural language processing applications.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have recently become very popular as a method of categorising information online and have been used to annotate a wide range of different resources. In such systems users are free to choose whatever keywords or "tags" they wish to annotate each resource, resulting in a highly personalised, unrestricted vocabulary. While this freedom of choice has several notable advantages, it does come at the cost of making searching of these systems more difficult as the vocabulary problem introduced is more pronounced than in a normal information retrieval setting. In this paper we propose to use hidden topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall. We first describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a simple topic model and then introduce 2 extended models which can be used to personalise the results by including information about the user who made each annotation. We test these 3 models and compare them with 3 non-topic model baselines on a large data sample obtained from the Delicious social bookmarking site. Our evaluations show that our methods significantly outperform all of the baselines with the personalised models also improving significantly upon unpersonalised LDA. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={This paper introduces a folksonomy-based recommendation system for the worldwide Sensor Web which aims to aid users to deal with the terabytes of data that are generated by the sensors. We demonstrate how folksonomies could be adopted for the Sensor Web and other geospatial applications dealing with large volumes of data, by exploiting the geospatial information associated with three key components of such collaborative tagging systems: tags, resources and users. We propose algorithms for: i) suggesting tags for users during the tag input stage; ii) generating tag maps which provides for serendipitous browsing; and iii) personalized searching within the folksonomy. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms using an existing large dataset. An implementation of the folksonomy for the emerging Sensor Web platform is also presented. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the development of Web collection recommendation algorithms surrender quality to the huge and sparse dataset. A memory-based collaborative filtering method increases computational complexity. Obviously sparsity and expensive complexity of computation are trade-offs. In order to settle this problem we propose an improved recommendation algorithm based on collaborative tagging called personalized filtering (PF). PF defines and weighs the feature of tags using 4-D dataset, which can show latent personal interests and long-term personal interests. To decrease the computational complexity, PF constructs a top-N tags set to filter out the undersized dataset. To track the changes of personal interests, PF proposed a novel interest changing algorithm on the 4-D dataset. Some empirical experiments were done and the results shown that the sparsity level of PF is much lower and the computing speed is faster than traditional algorithms. © 2011 NSP.},

abstract={One of the key requirements for the success of Service Oriented Architecture is discoverability of Web services. However, public services suffer from the lack of metadata. Current methods to provide such metadata are impractical for the volume of services published on the Web: they are too expensive to be implemented by a service broker, and too difficult to be used for retrieval. We introduce structured collaborative tagging to address these issues. Here, user tags not only aspects relevant for her but also suggested ones (input, output and behavior). Cost, performance and usability of the proposed technique obtained during the Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest are reported. Obtained results suggests that there is no "free lunch." While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as a mechanism to describe items in large on-line collections. Tags are assigned by users to describe and find back items, but it is also tempting to describe the users in terms of the tags they assign or in terms of the tags of the items they are interested in. The tag-based profile thus obtained can be used to recommend new items. If we recommend new items by computing their similarity to the user profile or to all items seen by the user, we run into the risk of recommending only neutral items that are a bit relevant for each topic a user is interested in. In order to increase user satisfaction many recommender systems not only optimize for accuracy but also for diversity. Often it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between accuracy and diversity. In this paper we introduce topic aware recommendation algorithms. Topic aware algorithms first detect different interests in the user profile and then generate recommendations for each of these interests. We study topic aware variants of three tag based recommendation algorithms and show that each of them gives better recommendations than their base variants, both in terms of precision and recall and in terms of diversity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={The informal setting of learning at work give rise for unique challenges to the field of technology enhanced learning systems. Personalized recommendations taking into account the current context of the individual knowledge worker are a powerful approach to overcome those challenges and effectively support the knowledge workers to meet their individual information needs. Basis for these recommendations to adopt to the current context of a knowledge worker can be provided by user models which reflects the topics knowledge workers are dealing with and their corresponding knowledge levels, but research has only focused on user modeling in settings with a static underlying domain model so far. We suggest to model the users' context based on the emergent topics they are dealing with and their individual current knowledge levels within these topics by extracting the necessary information from the user's past activities within the system. Based on data from an experiment with students learning a new topic with the help of a collaborative tagging system, we started to evaluate this approach and report on first results.},

We propose a model that allows tagging as well as establishing relations between any pair of resources, not just objects and tags. Moreover, we propose to use this extension to enrich and facilitate the process of building semantic knowledge representations.

Specifically, in the following, the users' social connections in consideration were groups. Unlike other studies which utilized groups inferred by data mining technologies, we used the information about the groups in which each user explicitly participated. The group activities are centered on common interests. People join a group to share and acquire information about a topic as a form of community of interest or practice. The information of this group activity may be a good source of information for the members. We tested whether adding the information from the users' own groups or group members to the traditional CF-based recommendations can improve the recommendation quality or not. The information about groups was combined with CF using a mixed hybridization strategy. We evaluated our approach in two ways, using the Citeulike data set and a real user study.

abstract={The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

abstract={This research work presents a folksonomic annotation used in a collaborative tagging system to enhance the Web service discovery process. More expressive than traditional tags, this structural tagging method is able to reflect the functional capability of Web services, easy to use and very much accessible to users than ontology or logic based formalism of annotation. We describe a Web service retrieval system exploiting the aforementioned structural tagging. System user profiling is also approached in order to further assign reputation and compute tag recommendation. We present some interesting usage scenarios of this system and also a strategy to evaluate its performance.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems (CTS) enable Internet users to annotate for resources using custom tags, and the tags reflect the user interest and thus form a user profile. However, the flexibility of tagging brings large number of synonymous and polysemous tags which make the use of these profile information to personalize resource recommendation difficult. We propose to use graph-based clustering to form groups of semantically-related tags in the offline stage. Then in the online stage the tag clusters act as an intermediary between users and resource and are utilized to personalize the query results in CTS. 5-fold cross-validation is performed on two data sets, the results are compared with two other algorithms. Results show that the algorithm proposed demonstrate much better personalization measured by the F-value, whilst the effect is more miraculous in a multi-topic than in a single-topic CTS. This observation suggests that in a multi-topic CTS tag clustering such as proposed in this paper is an important strategy. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Social resource sharing systems are central elements of the Web 2.0 and use the same kind of lightweight knowledge representation, called folksonomy. Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Results indicate a steady decrease in the number of unique tags over the four years, suggesting an increasing stability in the community vocabulary over time and the establishment of domain-specific vocabulary. Members reused each others' tags over time and exhibited increasingly collaborative tagging behaviour. Tag discrimination was high, with 4.11 distinct articles per tag. The stable and discriminatory nature of the community's tags suggests that collaborative tagging may serve as a useful resource for vocabulary choice or maintenance by KMS managers. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy [11]) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in a collaborative tagging environment.

We examine data on tagging practices from the Delicious web site (delicious.com) and find that there is little support for any of these beliefs. Although users individually do seem to have a small set of tags that they use in a controlled and effective way, they also use very large sets of other tags in a much more haphazard way. These poorly managed tags obscure much of the collective sense making and implicit community structure. We derive some suggestions for improving collaborative tagging systems.

abstract={Collaboration and information sharing among government organizations is becoming increasingly important for promoting efficiency and productivity as well as for enhancing citizen services. With Internet connectivity widely available and with the ease-of-use of social media tools, citizens actively participate in producing content. However, the abundance of content causes another problem for governments-the difficulty of determining what truly useful and relevant information is to be shared for mission critical tasks and to produce better citizen services. Information resources, such as data, documents, multimedia objects and services stored in different agencies and produced by citizens need to be easily discovered and shared. We propose a data model of rich social tags and a Citizen-Government collaborative tagging environment} where governments and citizens can collaboratively annotate the resources, thus facilitating collaboration responsiveness through accessibility to information. The collaborative annotations capture not only the semantics but also the pragmatic and social aspects related to the resources, such as who, when, where, how and for what related tasks the resources are shared. The benefits of the a rich tag data model emphasizing the relationships of a tag to semantic, social, pragmatic and contextual reference frames include the ability to filter, discover and search new and dynamic as well as hidden resources, to navigate between resources in a search by traversing semantic relationships, and to recommend the most relevant government information even when distributed over different agencies. A distributed architecture of a government collaborative tagging system is proposed and tag-based search and recommendations are illustrated. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.},

We report results of an experimental study in which we examined the interaction between individual expertise and the basic level advantage in collaborative tagging. The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

abstract={The content of collaborative tagging systems (so-called folksonomies) is generated, consumed, and annotated by the endusers. Users annotate and categorise their data using free-keywords, so-called tags. Consequently, several linguistic problems come to the surface in folksonomies such as; synonyms, polysemy, multilinguality, and others which produce ambiguous and inconsistent classification of data. Therefore, relevant results are not retrieved in the user's query. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to enhance the "social vocabulary" presented in folksonomies with the "controlled vocabulary" presented in Semantic Web ontologies. Therefore, our proposed approach uses the online WordNet lexical ontology in addition to the EuroWordNet multilingual lexical resource. Our approach tries to employ the ontological relations presented in WordNet in the folksonomy, it focuses only on the problems of synonyms, tag relations, and multilinguality.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the "noise". Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with 3-mode tensors, in order to capture the 3-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multi-way analysis, latent semantic correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Nevertheless, high-order tensors tend be sparse, a fact that hinders the application of multi-way analysis. To address this problem, we propose the application of kernel-based methods, which act as smoothing functions against sparsity. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Bibsonomy), indicates the superiority of the proposed method against the non kernel-based method and also against other baseline methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

It has been argued that the power of tagging lies in the ability for people to freely determine the appropriate tags for resources without having to rely on a predefined lexicon or hierarchy. The freeform nature of tagging causes a number of problems in this social classification scheme, such as synonymy and morphological variety. However, social tagging can be a valuable source of information to help in the organization of Web resources. In this paper we present an empirical analysis carried out to determine the importance of social tagging in Web page classification.

In a tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests, and taxonomy is a useful way to organize these tags. As tags change over time, it is imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two key features. Firstly, we develop a novel context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. Secondly, we propose several algorithms for evolutionary taxonomy fusion. We conduct an extensive performance study using a very large real-life dataset (i.e., Del.ici.ous). The empirical results clearly show that our approach is effective and efficient. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper approaches the problem by applying a combined set of techniques and tools (that uses tags, domain ontologies, keyphrase extraction methods) thereby generating tags automatically. The proposed approach is implemented in the PIRATES (Personalized Intelligent tag Recommender and Annotator TEStbed) framework, a prototype system for personalized content retrieval, annotation, and classification. A case study application is developed using a domain ontology for software engineering. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications or folksonomies allow internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. However, freedom afforded users come at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag ambiguity hindering navigation. Ambiguity can mislead users as they search for relevant resources. Recommenders that avoid ambiguous tags may be penalized by standard utility metrics for not promoting such tags. To provide effectiveness of tag recommendation in term of accuracy and coverage, we propose a new method for tag recommendation approach based on social semantic web to overcome ambiguity and presenting users tags and resources that correspond more closely. This method is a combination of semantic content analysis methods and social network analysis methods. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Similarly, in tagging systems like Delicious or Flickr people share tagged resources with friends or unknown, similar users. Offline social networks have long been studied in sociology, epidemiology, etc. However, the new online networks offer new ways to revisit old theories as well as to find emerging trends with respect to information diffusion and sharing in the Web 2.0. The goal is to explore and exploit relational ties in a way to enable the mining of useful knowledge and effective information propagation/diffusion. Assuming no or only potential ties explicitly given, the focus is first on the analysis of collaborative tagging and its potentials for user profiling, recommendations and search. Some first related studies, approaches and ideas for future work address the identification and exploitation of weak and strong ties in online networks.},

abstract={Collective Intelligence has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. With new technologies, such as blogs, twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, people may create and disseminate content as never before. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Additionally, many open-source initiatives have shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. We have been working in this domain for a few years now, mostly focusing on small disaster relief groups and field command. One of the command problems is lack of information about the location where the disaster occurred. We believe some of this information could be crowdsourced, changing current practices and enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for crowdsourcing and present an initial proposal for harnessing collective intelligence for the fire department. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, such as Delicious, CiteULike, and others, allow users to annotate resources, for example, Web pages or scientific papers, with descriptive labels called tags. The social annotations contributed by thousands of users can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify documents, or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference methods do not make the best use of social annotation, since they do not take into account variations in individual users' perspectives and vocabulary. In a previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes the interests of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming: the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics of Web resources from social annotations obtained from Delicious in order to discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social knowledge contained in user-generated annotations. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing popularity of Social Media sites, a lot of user generated content has been injected in the Web, thus resulting in a large amount of both multimedia items (music - Last.fm, MySpace.com, pictures - Flickr, Picasa, videos - YouTube) and textual data (tags and other text-based documents). As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Prefixed by a # symbol with a keyword, a Twitter hashtag serves as a bottom-up user-proposed tagging convention. It also embodies user participation in the process of hashtag innovation, especially as it pertains to information organization tasks. Diffusion of innovation (DoI) is a theory that helps to explain the adoption process of an innovation by modeling its entire life cycle according to the aspects of communications and human information interactions. Hence, diffusion theory offers valuable insights into interface design that supports Twitter hashtag use and access. It also assists in evaluating hashtag life cycles and thus offering information required for decision-making, in regard to hashtag management.},

abstract={Tagging has rapidly become a popular way to annotate the content on social network sites. Tags describe the contents of the resource or provide additional contextual and semantical information to make the content more easily browsable and discoverable by others. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and a certain number of resources have no comments, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context. The results of the evaluation show that tag recommendation based on local lexicon is an effective way to improve collaborative resource sharing in social network.},

abstract={This paper analyses the tagging patterns on delicious.com for a set of documents (URLs) over a 4 year period using informetrics methods to assess how collaborative tagging supports and enhances traditional document indexing. Results of the study show that there is still a mix of consensus and divergence in tagging term use and tagging patterns. While some of the chosen URLs maintained or even increased their popularity, others experienced a severe drop in popularity. Tag usage showed some measures of influence between taggers, but users continued to use their own tags and the proportions of unique and untagged items has increased. Proportions of tags used showed fluctuations with islands of stability over a 4 year period. Patterns in the usage of tags assigned to these documents also highlighted practices related to personal and collective information organisation which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

abstract={Web 2.0 and social/collaborative tagging have altered the traditional roles of indexer and user. Traditional indexing tools and systems assume the top-down approach to indexing in which a trained professional is responsible for assigning index terms to information sources with a potential user in mind. However, in today's Web, end users create, organize, index, and search for images and other information sources through social tagging and other collaborative activities. One of the impediments to user-centered indexing had been the cost of soliciting user-generated index terms or tags. Social tagging of images such as those on Flickr, an online photo management and sharing application, presents an opportunity that can be seized by designers of indexing tools and systems to bridge the semantic gap between indexer terms and user vocabularies. Empirical research on the differences and similarities between user-generated tags and index terms based on controlled vocabularies has the potential to inform future design of image indexing tools and systems. Toward this end, a random sample of Flickr images and the tags assigned to them were content analyzed and compared with another sample of index terms from a general image collection using established frameworks for image attributes and contents. The results show that there is a fundamental difference between the types of tags and types of index terms used. In light of this, implications for research into and design of user-centered image indexing tools and systems are discussed. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging has been gaining increasing popularity in a large variety of websites. The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

Several information management approaches, such as desktop search, document organization and (collaborative) document tagging have been proposed to address this, however they are either inappropriate or inefficient. Automated collaborative document tagging approaches mitigate the problems of manual tagging, but they are usually based on centralized settings which are plagued by problems such as scalability, privacy, etc. To resolve these issues, we present P2P DocTagger, an automated and distributed document tagging system based on classification in P2P networks. P2P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval.

abstract={Social tagging or collaborative tagging has become a new trend in the organization, management, and discovery of digital information. The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become a very popular way to share, annotate, and discover online resources in Web 2.0. Yet as the number of resources in Collaborative tagging system grows over time, sifting through the large amounts of resources and finding the right resources to recommend to the right user is becoming a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate a probabilistic generative model for collaborative tagging, explore the implicit semantic connections in the sparse and noisy information space of heterogeneous users and unsupervised tagging. First, a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to cluster the tags and users simultaneously. The generalization of resource description and user could alleviate the tag noise and data sparseness of recommendation effectively. And then, considering that topic-based recommendation only takes the users' global interest into consideration without the capability of distinguishing users' interest in detail, we combine the global interests with the individual interest and community interest. Experimental results demonstrate the topicbased personalized recommendation method, which integrate both the commonality factor among users and the specialties of individuals, could alleviate data sparsity and provide a more flexible and effective recommendation than previous methods.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

abstract={In collaborative filtering recommender systems, there is little room for users to get involved in the choice of their peer group. It leaves users defenseless against various spamming or "shilling" attacks. Other social Web-based systems, however, allow users to self-select peers and build a social network. We argue that users' self-defined social networks could be valuable to increase the quality of recommendation in CF systems. To prove the feasibility of this idea we examined how similar are interests of users connected by self-defined relationships in a collaborative tagging systems Citeulike. Interest similarity was measured by similarity of items and meta-data they share and tags they use. Our study shows that users connected by social networks exhibit significantly higher similarity on all explored levels (items, meta-data, and tags) than non-connected users. This similarity is the highest for directly connected users and decreases with the increase of distance between users. Among other interesting properties of information sharing is the finding that between-user similarity in social connections on the level of metadata and tags is much larger than similarity on the level of items. Overall, our findings support the feasibility of social network based recommender systems and offer some good hints to the prospective authors of these systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The vast amounts of video that need to be tagged preclude the exclusive use of professional indexers. Thus a significant amount of video will need to be tagged by non-experts. Are the tags created by experts demonstrably superior to those of non-experts, and when non-experts have to be used for tagging, is it better to rely on tags created by those who upload videos or on others who watch the videos? Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

abstract={Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Recent research provides evidence for the presence of emergent semantics in collaborative tagging systems. While several methods have been proposed, little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems. A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging: Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others. In this work, we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures. We distinguish between categorizers, who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes, and describers, who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords. To study our hypothesis, we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers. Our results not only show that "verbose" taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics, but also that a subset containing only 40% of the most 'verbose' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset. Moreover, the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics. This work is relevant for designers and analysts of tagging systems interested (i) in fostering the semantic development of their platforms, (ii) in identifying users introducing "semantic noise", and (iii) in learning ontologies. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract={Requirements engineering is essentially a social collaborative activity in which involved stakeholders have to closely work together to communicate, elicit, negotiate, define, confirm, and finally come up with the requirements for the system to be implemented or upgraded. In the development of large and complex systems, with a huge number of uncertain stakeholders, the requirements engineering process becomes a challenging task due to overwhelming and dynamic social interactions, tradeoffs, and collective decisions made by above stakeholders. Traditional approaches and techniques are deficient in supporting this kind of social interactions in requirements-related activities, and managing the evolving requirements and their traceability caused by the social interactions. This paper proposes to address the challenges in the pre-requirements analysis of large and complex systems by employing the techniques from collective intelligence based on Web 2.0 tools and technologies, which is composed of three steps: first, obtain collective requirements knowledge through collaborative tagging by stakeholders; second, transform collaborative requirement tags into requirement ontologies; third, support collective requirement decision-making (i.e., collective intelligence) based on the requirement ontologies through requirements reasoning. © 2010 ACM.},

In order to emphasize the difference between the two concepts, we have taken into consideration the following: new vs. returning visitors, visitor loyalty, length as well as the depth of the visit to the site. Analyzing the data, one can observe that the visitor loyalty, their lengthy visits to the site and the pages they view are much higher for the site built on the principles of Web 2.0, compared to the classical sites. Likewise, we developed and implemented a collaborative tagging system that allows every registered user to publish, save and label the content with the help of tags. Therefore, this can help in building a model that not only offers customized content but also adapts the site to user needs by providing a recommendation system and aggregate collective intelligence. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube, del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success. State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

Participants can apply tags to different points of the interaction as it is ongoing and can see, in near real-time, the "flow" of tags as they are being contributed. Two novel types of tags are proposed: "deep tags" that apply to a portion of the interaction and "instant tags" that apply to an instant of the interaction. Our system is being used by enterprise users and we analyze a corpus of 737 live-tags collected from 16 conversations that took place over several months. We found that the live-tags for audio have slightly different characteristics from Web 2.0 tags: they are longer and confer affordances on the audio like description and summarization. Some observations on the "cognitive cost" of live-tagging are offered. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user-generated metadata. These annotations represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they are attached to, but it is not obvious which characteristics of the objects are predominantly described. The usefulness of these tags for finding/re-finding the annotated resources is also not completely clear. Several studies have started to investigate these issues, however only by focusing on a single type of tagging system or resource. We study this problem across multiple domains and resource types and identify the gaps between the tag space and the querying vocabulary. Based on the findings of this analysis, we then try to bridge the identified gaps, focusing in particular on multimedia resources. We focus on the two scenarios of music and picture resources and develop algorithms, which identify usage (theme) and opinion (mood) characteristics of the items. The mood and theme labels our algorithms infer are recommended to the users, in order to support them during the annotation process. The evaluation of the proposed methods against user judgements, as well as against expert ground truth reveal the high quality of our recommended annotations and provide insights into possible extensions for music and picture tagging systems to support retrieval. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social content systems contain enormous collections of unstructured user-generated content, annotated by the collaborative effort of regular Internet users. Tag-clouds have become popular interfaces that allow users to query the database of these systems by clicking relevant terms. However, these single click queries are often not expressive enough to effectively retrieve the desired content. Users have to use multiple clicks or type longer queries to satisfy their information need. To enhance the predicted content ranking we use a random walk model that effectively integrates the user's preference and semantically related query terms. We use the collaborative annotations from a popular on-line book catalog to create a social annotation graph and study the effect of personalization and smoothing for increasing query lengths. We show that personalization and smoothing allow the user to find equally relevant content with fewer query terms compared to a frequency based content ranking with TF-IDF weighing. As expected, we see that the influence of the random walk model disappears if users type more detailed queries. Finally, we discuss the observations with respect to synonyms and homographs which are well known to hamper the performance of information retrieval systems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular method in social resource sharing system. The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2 . Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. ©2010 IEEE.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a new knowledge propagation scheme to automatically propagate keywords from a subset of annotated images to the unannotated ones. The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation. Experimental results using 100 concept categories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The Games With A Purpose (GWAP) genre is a type of Human Computation that outsources certain steps of the computational process to humans. By taking advantage of people's desire to be entertained, GWAP attracts people to play voluntarily, and also produce useful metadata as a by-product. The games have shown promise in solving a variety of problems, which computer computation has been unable to resolve completely thus far. In this paper, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of GWAP systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of GWAP systems. We argue that it is important for GWAP systems to implement proper puzzle selection strategies in order to collect human intelligence in a more efficient manner. Therefore, based on our analysis, we implement an Optimal Puzzle Selection Strategy (OPSA) to improve GWAP systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed OPSA approach can effectively improve the system gain of GWAP systems, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large.

abstract={Collaborative tagging services (folksonomies) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era. They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications have attracted a considerable amount of attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.

abstract={Taxonomy is widely used in many of the website and directory navigation schemes for content/knowledge retrieval. However, information or content navigation support through taxonomy is often constrained due to its inability to take into account the full nomenclature and cultural nuances of knowledge seekers. The emergence and increasing adoption of collaborative tagging (social bookmarking) tools have provided lightweight and informal conceptual structures called folksonomies for knowledge retrieval. As for folksonomies, they reflect the vocabulary of the users. Hence, integrating folksonomies into a taxonomy combines the best of the two schemes as the resultant structure enhances taxonomy navigation with personsalisation for knowledge search and retrieval. This paper presents TaxoFolk, an algorithm for deriving hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy classification for enhanced knowledge navigation. The algorithm integrates folksonomy with a taxonomy through several unsupervised data mining techniques with augmented heuristics. © 2010 Operational Research Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications enable users to annotate online resources with user-generated keywords. The collection of these annotations and the way they connect users and resources produce a rich information space for users to explore. However the size, complexity and chaotic structure of these systems hamper users as they search for information. Recommenders can assist the user by suggesting resources, tags or even other users. Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions. Information channels can be used to explain the effectiveness of individual recommenders or explain the relative contribution of components in the hybrid recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Thanks to the continuous growth of collaborative platforms like YouTube, Flickr and Delicious, we are recently witnessing to a rapid evolution of web dynamics towards a more 'social' vision, called Web 2.0. In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

abstract={The explosion of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing, such as social networks, or video and photo sharing sites, radically changed the Web dynamics and the way people use and organize information. The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages. Results of experiments carried out on a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy, show that the use of content-based techniques improves the predictive accuracy of the tag recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social media systems have encouraged end user participation in the Internet, for the purpose of storing and distributing Internet content, sharing opinions and maintaining relationships. Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A straightforward solution is to compute a PageRank-like algorithm on a facet-related graph, but it is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on the graph analysis of YouTube and Flickr, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results with two gold standards. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as a primary means for storing and sharing data among friends, family, colleagues, or perfect strangers as long as they have common interests. del.icio.us3 is a social network where people store and share their personal bookmarks. Most importantly, users tag their bookmarks for ease of information dissemination and later look up. However, it is the friendship links, that make del.icio.us a social network. They exist independently of the set of bookmarks that belong to the users and have no relation to the tags typically assigned to the bookmarks. To study the interaction among users, the strength of the existing links and their hidden meaning, we introduce implicit links in the network. These links connect only highly "similar " users. Here, similarity can reeflect different aspects of the user's profile that makes her similar to any other user, such as number of shared bookmarks, or similarity of their tags clouds. The authors investigate the question whether friends have common interests, they gain additional insights on the strategies that users use to assign tags to their bookmarks, and they demonstrate that the graphs formed by implicit links have unique properties differing from binomial random graphs or random graphs with an expected power-law degree distribution. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general framework that incorporates collaborative social tagging with a novel ontology scheme conveying multiple perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a framework where multiple users tag the same object (an image in this case) and an ontology is extended based on these tags while being tolerant of different points of view. Both the tagging and the ontological models are intentionally designed to suit the multi-perspective environment. The paper develops a method based on a set of rules that determine how to associate new concepts to predefined perspectives (in addition to determining relations to topics or other concepts as typically done in previous research) and how to insert and maintain multiple perspectives. Findings - This case study experiment, with a set of selected annotated images, indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model. Originality/value - The proposed framework characterises the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development of a multi-perspective ontology and its application to improve image annotation, searching and browsing. The significance of this research is that it focuses on exploring the impact of creating a constantly evolving ontology based on collaborative tagging. The paper is not aware of any other work that has attempted to devise such an environment and to study its dynamics. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Taxonomy construction is a resource-demanding, top-down, and time consuming effort. It does not always cater for the prevailing context of the captured information. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically convert tags into a hierarchical taxonomy. Folksonomy describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords or tags to shared content. Using folksonomy as a knowledge source for nominating tags, the proposed method first converts the tags into a hierarchy. This serves to harness a core set of taxonomy terms; the generated hierarchical structure facilitates users' information navigation behavior and permits personalizations. Newly acquired tags are then progressively integrated into a taxonomy in a largely automated way to complete the taxonomy creation process. Common taxonomy construction techniques are based on 3 main approaches: clustering, lexico-syntactic pattern matching, and automatic acquisition from machine-readable dictionaries. In contrast to these prevailing approaches, this paper proposes a taxonomy construction analysis based on heuristic rules and deep syntactic analysis. The proposed method requires only a relatively small corpus to create a preliminary taxonomy. The approach has been evaluated using an expert-defined taxonomy in the environmental protection domain and encouraging results were yielded. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={All computer software systems, whether online or offline, require a help system. Help texts are traditionally written by software development companies and answer targeted questions in the form of how-tos and troubleshooting procedures. However, when the popularity of an application grows, users of the application themselves start adding to the corpus of help for the system in the form of online tutorials. There is, however, one problem with such tutorials. They have no direct link with the software for which they are written. Users have to search the Internet for different tutorials that are usually hosted on dispersed locations, and there is no ideal way of finding the relevant information without ending up with lots of noise in the search results. In this chapter, we describe a model for a help system which enhances this concept using collaborative tagging for categorization of “helplets.” For the knowledge retrieval part of the system, we utilize a previously developed technique based on common sense and user personalization. We use a freely available common sense reasoning toolkit for knowledge retrieval. Our architecture can be implemented in Web-based systems as well as in stand-alone desktop applications. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

abstract={With a suitable algorithm for ranking the expertise of a user in a collaborative tagging system, we will be able to identify experts and discover useful and relevant resources through them. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. Firstly, an expert should possess a high quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it. Secondly, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users do. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (SPamming-resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking), which implements these ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. We evaluate our method with experiments on data sets collected from Delicious.com comprising over 71,000 Web documents, 0.5 million users and 2 million shared bookmarks. We also show that the algorithm is more resistant to spammers than other methods such as the original HITS algorithm and simple statistical measures. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications have become a popular tool allowing Internet users to manage online resources with tags. Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.

abstract={The proliferation of social web technologies such as collaborative tagging has led to an increasing awareness of their vulnerability to misuse. Attackers may attempt to distort the system's adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. Prior work on recommender systems has shown that studying different attack types, their properties and their impact, can help identify robust algorithms that make these systems more secure and less vulnerable to manipulation. Unlike traditional recommender systems, a tagging system includes multiple retrieval algorithms to facilitate browsing of resources, users and tags. The challenge is, therefore, evaluating the impact of various types of attacks across different navigation options. In this paper we develop a framework for characterizing attacks against tagging systems. We then propose a methodology for evaluating their global impact based on PageRank. Using real data from a popular tagging systems, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of several attack types. Our results help us understand how much effort is needed from an attacker to change the behavior of a tagging system and which attack types are more successful against such systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal1.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label online resources. The tags are generally correlated and evolving according to the change of web contents, and the popularity of tags represent evolution of social interests. Tag taxonomy is a promising solution to organize the data in tagging systems. In this demonstration, we propose to construct the evolutionary taxonomy which incorporates the correlation and evolution of tags, as user generated tags grow and change temporally. We demonstrate that our approach is intuitive and efficient in tag organization which exploits the evolving characteristic of collaborative tagging systems. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems with user generated content have become a fundamental element of websites such as Delicious, Flickr or CiteULike. By sharing common knowledge, massively linked semantic data sets are generated that provide new challenges for data mining. In this paper, we reduce the data complexity in these systems by finding meaningful topics that serve to group similar users and serve to recommend tags or resources to users. We propose a well-founded probabilistic approach that can model every aspect of a collaborative tagging system. By integrating both user information and tag information into the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework, the developed models can be used to solve a number of important information extraction and retrieval tasks. © 2009 IEEE.},

Two documents that are maintained in the collection of the same user and/or assigned similar sets of tags can be considered as related from the perspective of the user, even though they may not be connected by hyperlinks. We call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents. We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks. This study suggests that by studying the collective behaviour of users we are able to enhance navigation and organisation of Web documents. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are social data repositories, in which users manage resources using descriptive keywords (tags). An important element of collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes a set of tags to each newly posted resource. In this paper we discuss the potential role of three tag sources: resource content as well as resource and user profiles in the tag recommendation system. Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for "content-based" and "graph-based" recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively.},

abstract={The number of published Web services has known a considerable growth these recent years making the task of finding the ones relevant to a requirement more and more complicated. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only in the internal characteristics related to Web service description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment. The success of Del.icio.us1, Flickr2, CiteULike3 and Connotea4 convinces us that collaborative tagging system is not only helpful in sharing and classifying Web resources but also can enhance the Web service discovery process. Without affecting actual Web 2.0 users' habit, we illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery (CoTE-WeD) allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. The system implementing our environment proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keyword-based and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed using WordNet 5 in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords.},

abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, like a web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model.We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuous growth of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing made possible the passage from an 'elitary' Web, written by few and read by many, towards the so-called Web 2.0, a more 'user-centric' vision, where users become active contributors in Web dynamics. In this context, collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging: in these platforms users can annotate resources they like with freely chosen keyword (called tags) in order to make retrieval of information and serendipitous browsing more and more easier. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems (called tag recommenders) is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated by exploiting different approaches. In this paper we present a tag recommender developed for the ECML-PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge. Our approach is based on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources.},

abstract={Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

abstract={Tagging is a process whereby users freely choose keywords to label web objects in order to share or recover them later. Tags associated to an object by the user depict his viewpoint or perception. The perception of the target user can be enhanced by aggregating and analyzing the tags associated to an object by other users who share at least one tag with the target user in common for that object and recommending tags to him. Most of the existing techniques recommend tags on the basis of their popularity among the users. The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes. To observe the performance of our approach, experiments are carried out on the data collected from del.icio.us, a social book marking site that allows the users to tag URLs and share them with other people. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance of recommender systems depends on whether the user profiles contain accurate information about the interests of the users, and this in turn relies on whether enough information about their interests can be collected. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to use their own words to describe their favourite resources, resulting in some user-generated categorisation schemes commonly known as folksonomies. Folksonomies thus contain rich information about the interests of the users, which can be used to support various recommender systems. Our analysis of the folksonomy in Delicious reveals that the interests of a single user can be very diverse. Traditional methods for representing interests of users are usually not able to reflect such diversity. We propose a method to construct user profiles of multiple interests from folksonomies based on a network clustering technique. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is able to generate user profiles which reflect the diversity of user interests and can be used as a basis of providing more focused recommendation to the users. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative Tagging is a powerful method to create folksonomies that can be used to grasp/filter user preferences or enhance web search. Recent research has shown that depending on the number of users and the quality of user-provided tags powerful community-driven semantics or "ontologies" can emerge - as it was evident analyzing user data from social web applications such as del.icio.us or Flickr. Unfortunately, most web pages do not contain tags and, thus, no vocabulary that describes the information provided. A common problem in web page annotation is to motivate users for constant participation, i.e. tagging. In this paper we describe our approach of a binary verification game that embeds collaborative tagging into on-line games in order to produce domain specific folksonomies.

Our second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering (NwCF), incorporates the amount of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. A modified version of the Okapi BM25 IR model over users' tags is implemented on our third approach to form the user neighborhood. Our results suggest that incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, and they also support that tags can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors in a collaborative tagging system.},

To address these issues, we propose a multi-step approach for creating domain specific concept hierarchies from collaborative tags.

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow users to annotate online resources. The result is a complex tapestry of interrelated users, resources and tags often called a folksonomy. Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

abstract={Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={The amount of text data on the Internet is growing at a very fast rate. Online text repositories for news agencies, digital libraries and other organizations currently store giga- and tera-bytes of data. Large amounts of unstructured text poses a serious challenge for data mining and knowledge extraction. End user participation coupled with distributed computation can play a crucial role in meeting these challenges. In many applications involving classification of text documents, web users often participate in the tagging process. This collaborative tagging results in the formation of large scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems which can function, scale and self-organize in the presence of highly transient population of nodes and do not need a central server for co-ordination. In this paper, we describe TagLearner, a P2P classifier learning system for extracting patterns from text data where the end users can participate both in the task of labeling the data and building a distributed classifier on it. We present a novel distributed linear programming based classification algorithm which is asynchronous in nature.

abstract={In recent years, tagging systems have been paid increasing attentions from both research communities and system designers. Most popular online social networking sites harness tag for managing and locating contents, for organizing and connecting users, and for recommending and sharing resources. We believe that tag acts like bridge between people and resources. Research on tag and tagging behavior will provide us insight about resource space and user activities on the Internet. In this paper, we present a two-level analysis of the tagging system of Del.icio.us. The results from both two levels confirm each other. In network level, we connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a social network of tags. By investigating its network feature, we find phenomena of small world and scale-free network. We also discover that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness. In individual level, users' tagging behaviors and patterns are observed by visualizing their bookmarking history on Del.icio.us. Besides, we study the linked users by their tags and find that users within a subscription network share more common interests than random pairs of users. During the analysis, we also discuss the implications of the findings for the design of tag-based system. © 2009 ACM.},

In order to improve recommendation results during this cold start period, we present a probabilistic approach to item recommendation. Our model extends previously proposed models such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) by merging both user-item as well as item-tag observations into a unified representation. We find that bringing tags into play reduces the risk of overfitting and increases overall recommendation quality. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other types of recommenders.

abstract={Social tagging systems present a new challenge to the researchers working on recommender systems. The presence of tags, which uncover the reasons of user interests to tagged items, opens a way to increase the quality of recommendations. Yet, there is no common agreement of how the power of tags can be harnessed for recommendation. In this paper we argue for the use of spreading activation approach for building tag-aware recommender systems and suggest a specific version of this approach adapted to the multidimensional nature of social tagging networks. We introduce the asymmetric measure of relevancy (proximity) of two nodes on a multidimensional network as a cumulative strength of (weighted) multiple connections between two nodes, which includes paths and graph-structures connecting the nodes. This metric is also applicable to measure relevancy of two sub-graphs. Spreading activation methods (SAM), which usually employ breadth first search, are an efficient way to define and compute such measure taking into account not only links constituent a path, but the properties of nodes in the path such as node's types and outdegree. We apply this notion of relevancy to measure similarity of collaborative tagging systems users and present the results of numerical simulation showing that spreading activation methods allow us to discriminate between diverse graph-structures connecting users via resources and tags. We show that the results of simulation are stable w.r.t. the variation of parameters of spreading activation algorithm used in our experiment.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr have achieved great success. This chapter is concerned with the problem of social tagging analysis and mining. More specifically, we discuss five properties of social tagging and their applications: 1) keyword property, which means social annotations serve as human selected keywords for Web resources; 2) semantic property, which indicates semantic relations among tags and Web resources; 3) hierarchical property, which means that hierarchical structure can be derived from the flat social tagging space; 4) quality property, which means that Web resources' qualities are varied and can be quantified using social tagging; 5) distribution property, which indicates the distribution of frequencies of social tags usually converges to a power-law distribution. These properties are the most principle characteristics, which have been popularly discussed and explored in many applications. As a case study, we show how to improve the social resource browsing by applying the five properties of social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={The discipline of finding and recommending new and similar multimedia content has gained a growing importance in multimedia information retrieval over the last years. The two classical approaches, namely Content-based filtering (CB) and Collaborative filtering (CF), can be used in conjunction with each other to get benefit from both content analysis and user feedback. This paper introduces a system, called GlobalMusic2one that implements a novel approach to hybrid music search by combining methods of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Web 2.0 techniques to reach a new quality in recommending and distributing global music collections. To be able to classify these collections and to determine relationships between them, textual descriptions are gathered by collaborative tagging and statistical Web document analysis, as relevant documents in the Web may contain a lot of freely accessible and descriptive information on music content. The resulting text corpus can be used to identify connected entities, e.g. which artist is connected or similar to another artist. Therefore, this approach sensibly complements CB and CF techniques and has already been successfully implemented in the interactive music search system NIMS, which will be introduced as well.},

Each peer maintains relevant personalized information about its tagging behavior as well as that of its social neighbors, and uses those to locally process its queries. Extensive experiments based on a real-world dataset crawled from del.icio.us shows that very little storage at each peer suffices to get almost the same results as a hypothetical centralized solution with infinite storage.

abstract={Social networking and tagging have taken off at an unexpected scale and speed, opening huge opportunities to enhance the user search experience. We present Gossple 1, a new, user-centric, approach to improve the exploration of the Internet. Underlying Gossple lies the intuition that while social networks provides news from your old buddies, you can learn a lot more from people you don't know, but with whom you share many (tagging) interests. More specifically, considering a collaborative tagging system with active taggers annotating content, Gossple expands the search query, of any user u, with tags that are considered "close" enough with respect to users that are "close" to u. Gossple users create their own network of social acquaintances in a gossip-based manner, by dynamically computing the estimation of a distance between taggers, based on cosine similarity between tags and items. These connections are used to feed a TagMap: our central abstraction that captures the personalised relationships between tags. The TagMap is then used by Gossple to meaningfully expand queries leveraging the personalised network. This is achieved through the TagRank algorithm, an adaptation of the celebrated pagerank algorithm, which automatically determines which tags best expand a list of tags in a given query. Gossple has no central authority: every user stores its own items and its tagging behaviour is stored only by its neighbours. The resulting networks are live, dynamic and do not require any underlying structure. We report on our evaluation of Gossple with CiteUlike traces, involving 33, 834 users. In short, we show that, with little information stored at every peer, Gossple enables to retrieve items that cannot be retrieved with state of the art search systems (complete- ness).Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Social networking sites like Flickr1, Youtube2 and Del.icio.us3 have been rapidly gaining popularity on the Internet, underscoring a transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. With this process, social tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. Folksonomy are data created in social tagging. Tags in folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition on information. They can reveal both the users' behavior and resources' properties. In this paper, we will study the vocabulary of users' tagging and the relationship between words. We connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a network of folksonomy, and investigate the semantic relatedness between tags within it. The result shows that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness, which is useful for designing future folksonomy-based systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

Our goal is to demonstrate practically that the aggregated tags applied to resources by the entire community define reasonably well resource meaning. This would allow using them for calculating semantic distance between resources. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed a large amount of data downloaded from del.icio.us. To this end, we developed an algorithm for searching 'similar' URLs based on the similarity of their aggregated tag vectors, which allowed us to identify clusters of similar resources. Our experimental findings demonstrate that massive tagging of resources leads to resource meanings that are defined bottom-up, and they prove the effectiveness of collaborative tagging systems for describing resources. © 2008 IEEE.},

We discuss techniques for mapping human activities onto Web services. We present a recommendation algorithm that is based on collaborative tagging of resources in SOA.

Based on the semantic analysis of the collaborative tags in Last.fm, the semantic similar tags are clustered into different groups and the visual distance represents the semantic similarity between tags, and thus the visualization offers a better semantic understanding of collaborative tags. A comparative evaluation is conducted with TagClouds and TagClusters based on the same tags collection.

abstract={Nowadays, the most dominant and noteworthy web information sources are developed according to the collaborative-web paradigm, also known as Web 2.0. In particular, it represents a novel paradigm in the way users interact with the web. Users (also called prosumers) are no longer passive consumers of published content, but become involved, implicitly and explicitly, as they cooperate by providing their own resources in an "architecture of participation". In this scenario, collaborative tagging, i.e., the process of classifying shared resources by using keywords, becomes more and more popular. The main problem in such task is related to well-known linguistic phenomena, such as polysemy and synonymy, making effective content retrieval harder. In this paper, an approach that monitors users activity in a tagging system and dynamically quantifies associations among tags is presented. The associations are then used to create tags clusters. Experiments are performed comparing the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art tag clustering technique. Results -given in terms of classical precision and recall- show that the approach is quite effective in the presence of strongly related tags in a cluster. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications such as delicious, flickr or lastfm have recently become extremely popular and as a result, a large amount of semantically rich metadata produced by users becomes available and exploitable. Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

abstract={Email is no longer perceived as a communication marvel, but rather as a constant source of information overload. Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

abstract={As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, music genre classification has attracted considerable research attention. Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

abstract={Recommendations in collaborative tagging sites such as del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies, are becoming increasingly important, due to the proliferation of general queries on those sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address those queries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy, item-based or user-based, one of the key concerns in producing recommendations, is over-specialization, which results in returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processing returned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (e.g., genre and actors for movies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are not available (e.g., URLs in del.icio.us). In a recent paper [20], we introduced the notion of explanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise between accuracy and diversity. In this paper, we develop efficient diversification algorithms built upon this notion. The algorithms explore compromises between accuracy and diversity. We demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in diversification on two real life data sets: del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the rapidly growing web 2.0 applications. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. This drawback has created the need for ontological structures which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations for translating and integrating the different sources. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for extracting ontological structure from folksonomies that exploits the power of low support association rule mining supplemented by an upper ontology such as WordNet. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We consider the problem of tag prediction in collaborative tagging systems where users share and annotate resources on the Web. We put forward HAMLET, a novel approach to automatically propagate tags along the edges of a graph which relates similar documents. We identify the core principles underlying tag propagation for which we derive suitable scoring models combined in one overall ranking formula. Leveraging these scores, we present an efficient top-k tag selection algorithm that infers additional tags by carefully inspecting neighbors in the document graph. Experiments using real-world data demonstrate the viability of our approach in large-scale environments where tags are scarce. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article uses data from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to empirically examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems and to study how coherent categorization schemes emerge from unsupervised tagging by individual users. First, we study the formation of stable distributions in tagging systems, seen as an implicit form of “consensus” reached by the users of the system around the tags that best describe a resource. We show that final tag frequencies for most resources converge to power law distributions and we propose an empirical method to examine the dynamics of the convergence process, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The convergence analysis is performed for both the most utilized tags at the top of tag distributions and the so-called long tail. Second, we study the information structures that emerge from collaborative tagging, namely tag correlation (or folksonomy) graphs.We show how community-based network techniques can be used to extract simple tag vocabularies from the tag correlation graphs by partitioning them into subsets of related tags. Furthermore, we also show, for a specialized domain, that shared vocabularies produced by collaborative tagging are richer than the vocabularies which can be extracted from large-scale query logs provided by a major search engine. © 2009, ACM.

abstract={Most of the existing personal knowledge management systems have been employing blogging services which is capable of providing various services (e.g., knowledge distribution and knowledge creation) to people. However, automated knowledge delivering service among the systems is difficult to take into account the corresponding context (or semantics) of the knowledge, so that the service can spread irrelevant information into knowledge management systems. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a novel architecture, called blog context overlay network, to fulfill context matching between blog-based knowledge management systems. It is referred to as detecting 'shared' context between knowledge management systems. Thus, with respect to the contexts, we want to identify a community of practice (CoP) on a knowledge blogosphere where a set of blog-based knowledge management systems are incorporating with each other. As a result, newly generated knowledge can be proactively diffused to the blog-based knowledge management systems of which context is relevant to the knowledge, even before the bloggers' queries are explicitly asked. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For the collaborative tagging information implies user's important personal preference information, it can be used to recommend personalized items to users. This paper proposes a novel tag-based collaborative filtering approach for recommending personalized items to users of online communities that are equipped with tagging facilities. Based on the distinctive three dimensional relationships among users, tags and items, a new similarity measure method is proposed to generate the neighborhood of users with similar tagging behavior instead of similar implicit ratings. The promising experiment result shows that by using the tagging information the proposed approach outperforms the standard user and item based collaborative filtering approaches. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Rather than following a collaborative filtering or annotation-based approach to recommendation, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) approach and present a unified recommendation model which evolves from item user and item tag co-occurrences in parallel. The inclusion of tags reduces known collaborative filtering problems related to overfitting and allows for higher quality recommendations.

abstract={Multimedia content is uploaded, tagged and recommended by users of collaborative systems such as YouTube and Flickr. These systems can be represented as tagged-graphs, where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the online computation of user-rankings associated to a set of tags, called a facet. A simple approach to faceted ranking is to apply an algorithm that calculates a measure of node centrality, say, PageRank, to a subgraph associated with the given facet. This solution, however, is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative solution: (i) first, a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) then, a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on empirical observations, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results to those produced by the direct calculation .},

abstract={The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system provides relevance searching, which is more effective than traditional keyword searching for searching personal resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

abstract={Consumer Generated Media(CGM) is growing rapidly and the amount of content is increasing. However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We propose the utilization of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicates that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we aim at finding informative usage patterns from tags by consistent clustering on tags using nonnegative matrix factorization. The clustered subjects, represented by weighed tag vectors, can then be used to build a subjectcentered user information seeking model for item recommendation. Experiments on two realworld datasets show that our subject-based algorithms substantially outperform the traditional CF methods as well as tag-enhanced recommendation approaches reported in the literature.},

abstract={This paper presents an in-depth study of the social tagging mechanisms used in Freesound.org, an online community where users share and browse audio files by means of tags and content-based audio similarity search. We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

abstract={More and more information is available on the Web, and the current search engines do a great job to make it accessible. Yet, optimizing for a large number of users, they usually provide good answers only to "most of us", and have yet to provide satisfying mechanisms to search for audiovisual content. In this talk I will present some ongoing work at L3S addressing these challenges, done in the context of several European Union funded projects on personal information management and web search. Regarding personalization, I will talk about personalizing Web Search based on user content, which goes beyond simple user profiles used in other systems. The algorithms presented improve Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user's personal information repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. Generating the additional query keywords is done by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Extensive empirical analysis shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Regarding search for audiovisual content, I will focus on exploiting user generated information, and discuss what kinds of tags are used for different resources and how they can help for search. Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. I will present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for different kinds of resources - Web pages, music, and images. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

The research addresses two complementary goals: using ICT to support the simplification of the corpus of norms and using ICT to facilitate search and retrieval of information in large archives in the legal domain. The contribution of this work is in the development of tools beyond state of the art for the e-discovery of relationships between sections of norms or other legal documents. To reach the best results in terms of effectiveness, the tools combine statistical and the semantic approaches. The effectiveness of the statistical tool has been measured in terms of precision, through an assessment procedure that involved some experts of the legal domain.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linking of a folksonomy (user vocabulary) and LCSH (controlled vocabulary) on the basis of word matching, for the potential use of LCSH in bringing order to folksonomies. Design/methodology/approach A selected sample of a folksonomy from a popular collaborative tagging system, Delicious, was wordmatched with LCSH. LCSH was transformed into a tree structure called an LCSH tree for the matching. A close examination was conducted on the characteristics of folksonomies, the overlap of folksonomies with LCSH, and the distribution of folksonomies over the LCSH tree. Findings The experimental results showed that the total proportion of tags being matched with LC subject headings constituted approximately twothirds of all tags involved, with an additional 10 percent of the remaining tags having potential matches. A number of barriers for the linking as well as two areas in need of improving the matching are identified and described. Three important tag distribution patterns over the LCSH tree were identified and supported: skewedness, multifacet, and Zipfianpattern. Research limitations/implications The results of the study can be adopted for the development of innovative methods of mapping between folksonomy and LCSH, which directly contributes to effective access and retrieval of tagged web resources and to the integration of multiple information repositories based on the two vocabularies. Practical implications The linking of controlled vocabularies can be applicable to enhance information retrieval capability within collaborative tagging systems as well as across various tagging system information depositories and bibliographic databases. Originality/value This is among frontier works that examines the potential of linking a folksonomy, extracted from a collaborative tagging system, to an authoritymaintained subject heading system. It provides exploratory data to support further advanced mapping methods for linking the two vocabularies. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, supported by many social networking websites, is currently enjoying an increasing popularity. The usefulness of this largely available tag data has been explored in many applications including web resources categorization,deriving emergent semantics, web search etc. However, since tags are supplied by users freely, not all of them are useful and reliable, especially when they are generated by spammers with malicious intent. Therefore, identifying tags of high quality is crucial in improving the performance of applications based on tags. In this paper, we propose TRP-Rank (Tag-Resource Pair Rank), an algorithm to measure the quality of tags by manually assessing a seed set and propagating the quality through a graph. The three dimensional relationship among users, tags and web resources is firstly represented by a graph structure. A set of seed nodes, where each node represents a tag annotating a resource, is then selected and their quality is assessed. The quality of the remaining nodes is calculated by propagating the known quality of the seeds through the graph structure. We evaluate our approach on a public data set where tags generated by suspicious spammers were manually labelled. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in measuring the quality of tags. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recently, many Web services such as social networking services, blogs, and collaborative tagging have become widely popular. Many attempts are being made to investigate user interactions by analyzing social networks among users. However, analyzing a social network with attributional data is often not an easy task because numerous ways exist to define features through aggregation of different tables. In this study, we propose an algorithm to identify important network-based features systematically from a given social network to analyze user behavior efficiently and to expand the services. We apply our method for link-based classification and link prediction tasks with two different datasets, i.e., an @cosme (an online viral marketing site) dataset and a Hatena Bookmark (collaborative tagging service) dataset, to demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm. Our algorithm is general and can provide useful network-based features for social network analyses. Copyright © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Considering the natural tendency of people to follow direct or indirect cues of other people's activities, collaborative filtering-based recommender systems often predict the utility of an item for a particular user according to previous ratings by other similar users. Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have nowadays become important data sources for populating semantic web applications. For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social bookmarking is the process through which users share tags for online resources like blogs with others. Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

abstract={This research paper reports part of a larger international study that employs collaborative tagging for effectively describing knowledge and learning resources (KLR) in an institutionalised setting. The number of these resources has increased enormously within organisations over time and with an increasing variety of quality standards, maturity and granularity of resources, the description of content with metadata becomes more and more challenging. Automatic extraction services and professional metadata authoring tools could not deliver the expected results. Therefore, this research project investigated and discussed collaborative tagging as a means to successfully tag KLR. This paper presents results of an online survey distributed to first-year Information Systems students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The results report on the study's key themes of commitment and convergence towards generally accepted collaborative tags. Commitment and convergence could be confirmed, but there is a need for further exploration with a higher number of participants. Collaborative tagging is suggested as a solution to facilitate the development of ontologies for describing organisational metadata. © 2008 Ronald Maier, Silke Retzer and Stefan Thalmann.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

In our paper, we have proposed a collective collaborative tagging (CCT) service architecture in which both service providers and individual users can merge folksonomy data (in the form of keyword tags) stored in different sources to build a larger, unified repository. We have also examined a range of algorithms that can be applied to different problems in folksonomy analysis and information discovery. These algorithms address several common problems for online systems: searching, getting recommendations, finding communities of similar users, and finding interesting new information by trends. Our contributions are to a) systematically examine the available public algorithms' application to tag-based folksonomies, and b) to propose a service architecture that can provide these algorithms as online capabilities.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity to explore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of a network of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers. Our results are supported by extensive experiments on del.icio.us datasets. © 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={Rapid growth of published Web services makes their discoveries more and more difficult. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keywordbased and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords. © 2008 IEEE.},

We also put forward the necessary data standards to interoperate at both data format and semantic levels. We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms. This improves search results in terms of recall and precision, and represents an innovative means of semantics-aware collaborative filtering and content ranking. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Whereas the number of services that are provided online is growing rapidly, current service discovery approaches seem to have problems fulfilling their objectives. Existing approaches are hampered by the complexity of underlying semantic service models and by the fact that they try to impose a technical vocabulary to users. This leads to what we call the service discovery gap. In this paper we envision an approach that allows users to query or browse services using free text tags, thus providing an interface in terms of the users' vocabulary instead of the service's vocabulary. Unlike simple keyword search, we envision tag clouds associated with services themselves as semantic descriptions carrying collaborative knowledge about the service that can be clustered hierarchically, forming lightweight "ontologies". Besides tag-based discovery only describing the service on a global view, we envision refined tags and refined search/discovery in terms of the concepts that are common to all current semantic service description models, i.e. input, output, and operation. We argue that Service matching can be achieved, by applying tag-cloud-based service similarity on the one hand and by clustering services using case based indexing and retrieval techniques on the other hand.},

abstract={There is a growing interest into how we represent and share tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. Conventional tags, meaning freely created tags that are not associated with a structured ontology, are not naturally suited for collaborative processes, due to linguistic and grammatical variations, as well as human typing errors. Additionally, tags reflect personal views of the world by individual users, and are not normalised for synonymy, morphology or any other mapping. Our view is that the conventional approach provides very limited semantic value for collaboration. Moreover, in cases where there is some semantic value, automatically sharing semantics via computer manipulations is extremely problematic. This paper explores these problems by discussing approaches for collaborative tagging activities at a semantic level, and presenting conceptual models for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies. We present criteria for the comparison of existing tag ontologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in relation to these criteria.},

While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system.

Collaborative tagging systems allow people to organize a set of resources of interest through unconstrained annotations based on free keywords commonly named tags. Suggestive tagging techniques support users in this organization process and have shown to be helpful also in fostering a quick convergence to a shared tag vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a tag recommender which relies on the content analysis of the resource to be tagged, as well as on the personal and collective tagging history. The main contribution of this work is a model which combines semantic content analysis methods with existing suggestive tagging techniques. The expected benefit is the improvement of the user experience in social bookmarking systems, and more generally in collaborative tagging systems.},

abstract={Consumer Generated Media (CGM) is growing rapidly and the amount of content is increasing. However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We proposed the use of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicated that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is the aggregate effort by a community of online users to annotate web content with metadata labels called tags. It is a simple activity that enriches our knowledge about digital content, and has gained popularity with services such as Del.icio.us. Del.icio.us has a large repository that evolves daily, presenting interesting new problems for IR. We present TagScore, a scoring function to rate the goodness of Del.icio.us tags for their associated web page. It gives us a succinct synopsis for a page that we can use to efficiently find similar pages. Using real Del.icio.us data, we show that our approach gives good correlation to cosine similarity but is several hundred times faster and requires minimal storage overhead. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, services that assist the user in the task of tagging, such as tag recommenders, are more and more required. Being the scenario similar to traditional recommender systems where nearest neighbor algorithms, better known as collaborative filtering, were extensively and successfully applied, the application of the same methods to the problem of tag recommendation seems to be a natural way to follow. However, it is necessary to take into consideration some particularities of these systems, such as the absence of ratings and the fact that two entity types in a rating scale correspond to three top level entity types, i.e., user, resources and tags. In this paper we cast the tag recommendation problem into a collaborative filtering perspective and starting from a view on the plain recommendation task without attributes, we make a ground evaluation comparing different tag recommender algorithms on real data.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizingWeb resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. This paper is the first to present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for very different kinds of resources and systems - Web pages (Del.icio.us), music (Last.fm), and images (Flickr) - and compares the results with anchor text characteristics. We analyze and classify sample tags from these systems, to get an insight into what kinds of tags are used for different resources, and provide statistics on tag distributions in all three tagging environments. Since even relevant tags may not add new information to the search procedure, we also check overlap of tags with content, with metadata assigned by experts and from other sources. We discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search, comparing them with user queries posted to search engines as well as through a user survey. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags.

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of the correlation of annotated information unit (textual) tags and geographical identification metadata geotags. Despite the increased usage of geotagging in collaborative tagging systems, most current research focuses on textual tagging alone in solving the tag search problem. This may result in difficulties to search for precise and relevant information within the given tag space. For example, inconsistencies like polysemy, synonyms, and word inflections with plural forms complicate the tag search problem. Therefore, more work needs to be done to include geotag information with existing tagging information for analysis. In this paper, to make geotagging possible to be used in analysis with tagging, we prove that there is a strong correlation between tagging and geotagging information. Our approach uses tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity to determine inter-relationships among tags and geotags. From our initial experiments, we show that the power law is established between tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity: this means that tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity has a strong correlation and the correlation can be used to find more relevant tags in the tag space. The power law confirms that there is an increased relationship between tagging and geotagging and the increased relationship is scalable in size of tags and geotags. Also, using both geotagging and tagging information instead of only tagging, we show that the uncertainty between derived and actual similarities among tags is reduced. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Information on Web2.0, generated by users of web based services, is both difficult to organize and organic in nature. Content categorization and search in such situation offers challenging scenarios. The primary means of content categorization in such social services is folk-sonomy or collaborative tagging. During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model. The results of the study are analyzed and future directions along this path of research are presented.},

abstract={Nowadays the Web represents a growing collection of an enormous amount of contents where the need for better ways to find and organize the available data is becoming a fundamental issue, in order to deal with information overload. Keyword based Web searches are actually the preferred mean to seek for contents related to a specific topic. Search engines and collaborative tagging systems make possible the search for information thanks to the association of descriptive keywords to Web resources. All of them show problems of inconsistency and consequent reduction of recall and precision of searches, due to polysemy, synonymy and in general all the different lexical forms that can be used to refer to a particular meaning. A possible way to face or at least reduce these problems is represented by the introduction of semantics to characterize the contents of Web resources: each resource is described by one or more concepts instead of simple and often ambiguous keywords. To support these task the availability of a global semantic resource of reference is fundamental. On the basis of our past experience with the semantic tagging of Web resources and the SemKey Project, we are developing Tagpedia, a general-domain "encyclopedia" of tags, semantically structured for generating semantic descriptions of contents over the Web, created by mining Wikipedia. In this paper, starting from an analysis of the weak points of non-semantic keyword based Web searches, we introduce our idea of semantic characterization of Web resources describing the structure and organization of Tagpedia. We introduce our first realization of Tagpedia, suggesting all the possible improvements that can be carried out in order to exploit its full potential.},

When users click on a tag included in the tag cloud while watching the video, the tag gets associated with the time point of the video. Users can share the information on the tags that have already been clicked. We confirmed that the coverage of annotations generated by this method is higher than that of the existing methods, and users are motivated to add tags by using tag-sharing and tag-cloud methods.

abstract={Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one. © 2008 ACM.},

We motivate the preferred usage of feeds compared to full site grabbing, and present analysis results of feed data from a period of one month concerning feature distribution, growth, stability and convergence aspects. Furthermore we compare tag spaces and their intersections for potential interoperability and integration of these services, and reveal that tags in practice are not really as freely chosen as often promised.},

The objective of this research is to analyze the descriptors and tags from journal articles indexed in the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and the folksonomy-based website CiteULike to determine overlap between the controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies. Metadata from 2,786 journal articles indexed in ERIC and CiteULike was collected using Perl and MySQL. The total metadata was comprised of 2,899 unique ERIC descriptors, 3,176 unique CiteULike tags, and 1,083 unique CiteULike users. An analysis of this metadata revealed that 240 of the CiteULike tags matched ERIC descriptors. The low number of tag-descriptor matches in this research indicates that CiteULike users do not use the same terminology as subject specialists who maintain descriptors in the ERIC thesaurus.

abstract={Recommender Systems (RS) aim at predicting items or ratings of items that the user are interested in. Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are "global" descriptions of items, tags are "local" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tagaware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three twodimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords - so called "tags" - to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is against the dynamically evolving nature of many contemporary media applications to be analysed in terms of conventional rigid ontologies that rely on expertise-based fixed categories and hierarchical structure. Many of these rely on sharing 'folksonomies', personal descriptions of information and objects for one's own retrieval. Such applications involve many feedback mechanisms via the community, and have been shown to have emergent properties of complex dynamic systems. We propose that such dynamically evolving information domains can be more usefully described by means of a soft ontology, a dynamically flexible and inherently spatial metadata approach for ill-defined domains. Our contribution is (1) the elaboration of the so far intuitive concept of soft ontology in a way that supports conceptualizing dynamically evolving domains. Further, our approach proposes (2) a whole new mode of interaction with information domains by means of recurring exploration of an information domain from multiple perspectives in search of more comprehensive understanding of it, i.e. multi-perspective exploration. We demonstrate this concept with an example of collaborative tagging in an educational context. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging, otherwise known as "folksonomies", emanate from the flexibility they afford users in navigating large information spaces for resources, tags, or other users, unencumbered by a pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchy. Despite its advantages, social tagging also increases user overhead in search and navigation: users are free to apply any tag they wish to a resource, often resulting in a large number of tags that are redundant, ambiguous, or idiosyncratic. Data mining techniques such as clustering provide a means to overcome this problem by learning aggregate user models, and thus reducing noise. In this paper we propose a method to personalize search and navigation based on unsupervised hierarchical agglomerative tag clustering. Given a user profile, represented as a vector of tags, the learned tag clusters provide the nexus between the user and those resources that correspond more closely to the user's intent. We validate this assertion through extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A huge amount of data and metadata emerges from Web 2.0 applications which have transformed the Web to a mass social interaction and collaboration medium. Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={While collaborative tagging is attractive because of their easy and simple way to tag and search, tag based search suffers from no semantic descriptions for contents. Semantic web technologies provide a new way to annotating and retrieving images. We address the problems of both folksonomy and semantic web annotation systems for image retrieval in particular and argue that this can be improved by giving meanings to users' tags. This paper considers using both minimized domain-specific ontology and generic ontology. We show how less detailed ontologies can help end users to annotate and search with the simple user interface. Our prototype system has the capability to describe the semantics for contents of an image. Also, no previous extra work to create instances according to the ontology for later annotations is needed. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={As the number of Web 2.0 sites offering tagging facilities for the users' voluntary content annotation increases, so do the efforts to analyze social phenomena resulting from generated tagging and folksonomies. Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused. In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as Semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data. © 2008 IEEE.},

Annotations, such as those resulting from collaborative tagging, provide a new source of information which can be used to ease the process of authoring and updating domain ontologies. This paper presents an extension to the LOCO-Analyst tool, which leverages student folksonomies to support instructors when revising and updating course domain ontologies. The support is based on a computation of relatedness between ontology concepts and students tags which takes into account the "context" defined by the domain ontology. The computed scores are visualized in a tag cloud along with tag popularity scores, to allow instructors to easily comprehend the emergent feedback of their students. This approach allows for a simple and intuitive method for instructors to associate tags with concepts in their domain ontology. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={A distributed classification paradigm known as collaborative tagging has been widely adopted in new Web applications designed to manage and share online resources. Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={As a representative Web 2.0 application, collaborative tagging has been widely adopted and inspires significant interest from academies. Roughly, two lines of research have been pursued: (a) studying the structure of tags, and (b) using tag to promote Web search. However, both of them remain preliminary. Research reported in this paper is aimed at addressing some of these research gaps. First, we apply complex network theory to analyze various structural properties of collaborative tagging activities to gain a detailed understanding of user tagging behavior and also try to capture the mechanism that can help explain such tagging behavior. Second, we conduct a preliminary computational study to utilize tagging information to help improve the quality of Web page recommendation. The results indicate that under the user-based recommendation framework, tags can be fruitfully exploited as they facilitate better user similarity calculation and help reduce sparsity related to past user-Web page interactions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we apply a statistical approach for discovering topic-specific bursts from a popular CTS - del.icio.us. This approach allows trend discovery from different components of the system such as users, tags, and resources. Based on the detected topic bursts, we perform a preliminary analysis of related burst formation patterns. Our findings indicate that users and resources contributing to the bursts can be classified into two categories: old and new, based on their past usage histories. This classification scheme leads to interesting empirical findings. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

abstract={Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact. © 2008 ACM.},

However, it is unclear whether the tag cloud is actually useful as an aid to finding information. We conducted an experiment, giving participants the option of using a tag cloud or a traditional search interface to answer various questions. We found that where the information-seeking task required specific information, participants preferred the search interface. Conversely, where the information-seeking task was more general, participants preferred the tag cloud. While the tag cloud is not without value, it is not sufficient as the sole means of navigation for a folksonomy-based dataset. © CILIP.},

abstract={Recently collaborative tagging has received great attention as a public effort to create and share annotations on the web pages. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on how this user added descriptions associated with web resources can be used to enhance the existing web search paradigm. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on data collected from delicio.us, one of the most popular collaborative tagging website. Some useful conclusions on the usage of different tags have been drawn from our data analysis.

abstract={Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to add data items and to attach their own metadata (i.e., tags) to stored data. The result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content and the metadata become harder to manage due to increased content diversity. Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of two collaborative tagging communities that target the management of scientific literature: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover the structure of the tagging communities we study. The properties of the structure we uncover suggest a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests. Finally, we offer preliminary results that suggest that the interest-based structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content retrieval and navigation as communities scale.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging has become popular in the web2.0 world. Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has grown on the Internet as a new paradigm for web information discovering, filtering and retrieval. In the physical world, we use visual tags: labels readable by smartphones with cameras. While visual tags are usually related to a web site address, collaborative tagging, instead, provides updated, recommended information contributed and shared by users. In this paper we investigate the combination of collaborative tagging systems with visual tags. We present a prototype of a semiautomatic system generating visual tags which gather information from collaborative tagging. The user can interact with a list of relevant tags (built by clustering closely related tags) that can be further encoded in a visual tag, according to user's preferences. The user experience is enriched by retrieving multimedia content linked to the selected tags, present on the web. We finally show a case study illustrating our approach. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.},

abstract={The ontology development process is typically led by single or small groups of experts, with users mostly playing a passive role. Such an elitist approach in building ontologies hinders the primary purpose of large-scale knowledge sharing. Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a new web annotation method proving appealing features in fostering users to collaboratively organize information through their own metadata. Collaborative tagging shifts the creation of metadata for indexing web resources, from an individual professional activity to a collective endeavor, where every user is a potential contributor. In this paper we introduce an approach to knowledge evolution which aims to exploit the ability of collaborative tagging in fostering community members participation to move forward an initial knowledge structure. We present user scenarios about how subscribers of a scientific digital library might play the role of knowledge organizers through personal organization and sharing of citations of interest.},

abstract={The emergence of collaborative tagging systems with their underlying flat and uncontrolled resource organization paradigm has led to a large number of research activities focussing on a formal description and analysis of the resulting "folksonomies". An interesting outcome is that the characteristic qualities of these systems seem to be inverse to more traditional knowledge structuring approaches like taxonomies or ontologies: The latter provide rich and precise semantics, but suffer - amongst others - from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. An important step towards exploiting the possible synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy. This position paper presents preliminary results of ongoing work to induce hierarchical relationships among tags by analyzing the aggregated data of collaborative tagging systems as a basis for an ontology learning procedure.},

Thereafter, a focus group of teachers evaluated a sample of learning resources with metadata records containing both thesaurus terms and multilingual tags. The results of this early study suggest that some tags are found as useful as thesaurus terms and that users are divided about the benefits of multilingual tags. As some tags are useful for some users, "hiding all but the right tags" becomes crucial for the success of a multilingual collaborative tagging system.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign kyeword-so called "tags"-to resources. Tags are used for navigation finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we present two tag recommendation algorithms: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, an adaptation of the well-known PageRank algorithm that can cope with undirected triadic hyperedges. We evaluate and compare both algorithms on large-scale real life datasets and show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy. One problem offolksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={While the Semantic Web requires a large amount of structured knowledge (triples) to allow machine reasoning, the acquisition of this knowledge still represents an open issue. Indeed, expressing expert knowledge in a given formalism is a tedious process. Less structured annotations such as tagging have, however, proved immensely popular, whilst existing unstructured or semi-structured collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have proven to be useful and scalable. Both processes are often regulated through social mechanisms such as wiki-like operations, recommendations, ratings, and collaborative games. To promote collaborative tagging as a means to acquire unstructured as well as structured knowledge we introduce the notion of Extreme Tagging, which describes systems which allow the tagging of resources, as well as of tags themselves and their relations. We provide a formal description of extreme tagging followed by examples and highlight the necessity of regulatory processes which can be applied to it. We also present a prototype implementation.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords-so called "tags"-to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare two recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, We show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={When authors publish their interpretations of the ideas, opinions, claims or rebuttals in the literature, they are drawing on a repertoire of well understood moves, contributing to an extended discourse. Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

abstract={A large part of the modern web is characterized by usergenerated content categorized using collaborative tagging or folksonomy. It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community web sites. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including whether coherent categorization schemes can emerge from unsupervised tagging by users. This paper uses data from the social bookmarking site delicio. us to examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we examine whether the distribution of the frequency of use of tags for "popular" sites with a long history (many tags and many users) can be described by a power law distribution, often characteristic of what are considered complex systems. We produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to understand the basic dynamics behind tagging, including how a power law distribution of tags could arise. We empirically examine the tagging history of sites in order to determine how this distribution arises over time and to determine the patterns prior to a stable distribution. Lastly, by focusing on the high-frequency tags of a site where the distribution of tags is a stabilized power law, we show how tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags can be used to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags.},

This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Folksonomies have the potential to add much value to public library catalogues by enabling clients to: store, maintain, and organize items of interest in the catalogue using their own tags. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the tags that constitute folksonomies are structured. Tags were acquired over a thirty-day period from the daily tag logs of three folksonomy sites, Del.icio.us, Furl, and Technorati. The tags were evaluated against section 6 (choice and form of terms) of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) guidelines for the construction of controlled vocabularies. This evaluation revealed that the folksonomy tags correspond closely to the NISO guidelines that pertain to the types of concepts expressed by the tags, the predominance of single tags, the predominance of nouns, and the use of recognized spelling. Potential problem areas in the structure of the tags pertain to the inconsistent use of the singular and plural form of count nouns, and the incidence of ambiguous tags in the form of homographs and unqualified abbreviations or acronyms. Should library catalogues decide to incorporate folksonomies, they could provide clear guidelines to address these noted weaknesses, as well as links to external dictionaries and references sources such as Wikipedia to help clients disambiguate homographs and to determine if the full or abbreviated forms of tags would be preferable.

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Finding good keywords to describe resources is an on-going problem. Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

abstract={The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

Also, we define concept of knowledge for individual agents. Later we use concepts of interaction and knowledge to give definition of a Link. Then, for a given Universal Set of Resources, we introduce Tag Cloud System (TCS) and definition of (possibly fuzzy) collections of resources. Finally, we introduce concept of Class, based on projection of collections of resources in the TCS, to lay down some of the groundwork towards TCS-based type system.},

Using frequency data and co-word analysis matrices analyzed by multi-dimensional scaling, the authors discovered that tagging practices to some extent work in ways that are continuous with conventional indexing. Small numbers of tags tend to emerge by unspoken consensus, and inconsistencies follow several predictable patterns that can easily be anticipated. However, the tags also indicated intriguing practices relating to time and task which suggest the presence of an extra dimension in classification and organization, a dimension which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

In current tagging systems resources as a whole are annotated with and referenced by user defined tags. For multimedia data, as e. g. for video data, single scenes can be identified and annotated by using MPEG-7 metadata. We propose a collaborative tagging system that is combined with an automated annotation system for synchronized multimedia presentations. MPEG-7 metadata are used for the annotation of single scenes with user compiled tagging information in combination with metadata provided directly by the author or by other annotation systems. Thus, we propose a system being able to search within multimedia data that can further be extended to search within any kind of (partial) document to achieve a more tightly focused and personalized search.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to provide an overview of the collaborative tagging phenomenon and explore some of the reasons for its emergence. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the related literature and discusses some of the problems associated with, and the potential of, collaborative tagging approaches for knowledge organisation and general resource discovery. A definition of controlled vocabularies is proposed and used to assess the efficacy of collaborative tagging. An exposition of the collaborative tagging model is provided and a review of the major contributions to the tagging literature is presented. Findings - There are numerous difficulties with collaborative tagging systems (e.g. low precision, lack of collocation, etc.) that originate from the absence of properties that characterise controlled vocabularies. However, such systems can not be dismissed. Librarians and information professionals have lessons to learn from the interactive and social aspects exemplified by collaborative tagging systems, as well as their success in engaging users with information management. The future co-existence of controlled vocabularies and collaborative tagging is predicted, with each appropriate for use within distinct information contexts: Formal and informal. Research limitations/implications - Librarians and information professional researchers should be playing a leading role in research aimed at assessing the efficacy of collaborative tagging in relation to information storage, organisation, and retrieval, and to influence the future development of collaborative tagging systems. Practical implications - The paper indicates clear areas where digital libraries and repositories could innovate in order to better engage users with information. Originality/value - At time of writing there were no literature reviews summarising the main contributions to the collaborative tagging research or debate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Semantic Web mission is to enable a better organization of the Web content to improve the searching, navigation and integration of the available information. Although the Semantic Web is intended for machines, the process of creating and maintaining it is a social one: only people, for example, have necessary skills to create and maintain ontologies. While most existing ontologies are designed by single individuals or small groups of experts, actual ontology users are not involved in the development process. Such an individual approach in creating ontologies, lead to a weak community grounding. On the other hand, Social Software is becoming increasingly popular among web users, giving opportunities to exploit the potential of collaboration within a community. Tools like wikis and folksonomies allow users to easily create new content and share contributions over a social network. Social Software tools can go beyond their current limits, by exploiting the power provided by semantic technologies. Conversely, Semantic Web tools can benefit from the ability of Social Software in fostering collaboration among users, by lowering entry barriers. In this paper we propose a new approach for ontology evolution, considering collaborative tagging systems as an opportunity to complement classic approaches used in maintaining ontologies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={Movements of school mackerel (Scomberomorus queenslandicus) and spotted mackerel (S. munroi) in Australian east-coast waters were determined by tag and recapture methods and were used to investigate the stock structure of each species. In all, 4427 school mackerel and 2106 spotted mackerel were tagged and released between 1985 and 1995 in a collaborative tagging exercise with the Australian National Sportfishing Association. School and spotted mackerel were recaptured at rates of 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. School mackerel moved small distances from their release sites (26 ± 55 km, mean ± s.d.; maximum distance, 270 km), with these restricted movements indicating the possible existence of a number of stocks. In contrast, spotted mackerel moved large distances from their release sites (202 ± 290 km; maximum distance, 1100 km). Temporal and spatial movement patterns of spotted mackerel were characteristic of fish from a single stock undertaking a seasonal migration. Commercial harvest information in combination with tagging effort reflected the different movements of school and spotted mackerel and strengthened the suggested stock structure of each species.},

abstract={Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Information extraction relevant to the user queries is the challenging task in the ontology environment due to data varieties such as image, video, and text. The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of the file systems today are based on desktop metaphor utilizing hierarchies of folders and sub-folders for information storage and retrieval. A folder is usually assumed to store the semantically related information in the form of files and sub-folders. However, there always exist related files somewhere else in the local file system hierarchy. Users often fail to find these disconnected files or discover the relationship among these. File systems maintain a plain set of metadata items about each file which could be utilized to discover some of the hidden relationships. However, this meta-information is very sparse as most of this metadata is rarely entered by the user. Moreover, files in a file system are mostly private and cannot get the benefit of collaborative tagging. Web of Data, on the other hand also contains information related to the file system objects which could be utilized for linking with information in file systems. The purpose of introducing Linked Data technology was to solve similar issues on the web. This article investigates the exploitation of Linked Data technology in file systems and provides a comprehensive review on the possible use of Linked Data Technology in file systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The scale of the social web has integrated users in order to organize shared resources. Users freely associate keywords (tags) to resources. This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Alongside the enormous volume of user-generated content posted to World Wide Web, there exists a thriving demand for search personalization services, especially those utilizing collaborative tagging data. To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={E-learning is becoming more and more important in contemporary education. It allows learners to learn at their own pace, when their schedule permits it. However, learners have individual needs and different traits such as learning styles, knowledge levels, motivation and cognitive abilities. Therefore, a need for personalized learning has been made clear. Two ways of personalized learning are discussed in this paper: the first is Protus 2.1. - a tutoring system that allows personalization based on learning styles and collaborative tagging and the second one is PLeMSys - a model of a Moodle plug-in where personalization is based on learning styles and knowledge level.},

abstract={Recommender systems allow the exploration of large collections of products, the discovery of patterns in the products, and the guidance of users towards products that match their interests. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label products in a collection using a free vocabulary. The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users. This experience showed that TagProfiles are easier to understand and modify by users, allowing them to discover new movies as they interact with their profiles.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is technique, highly employed in different domains, which is used for automatic analysis of users’ preferences and recommendations. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing reputation of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and provide useful information to enhance algorithms for recommender systems. Besides helping user to organize his/her personal collections, a tag also can be regarded as a user’s personal opinion expression, while tagging can be considered as implicit rating or voting on the tagged information resources or items.

abstract={Collaborative tagging which is the keystone of the social practices of web 2.0 has been highly developed in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

abstract={Massive amounts of data are available on social websites, therefore finding the suitable item is a challenging issue. According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user’s preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={With the explosive growth of user-generated multimedia resources in the big data era (e.g., video, audio, text or even their combinations), bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics in multiple modes of data is a critical and indispensable issue. In this paper, we exploit a popular type of metadata called collaborative tags to address this issue. Specifically, we identify basic level concepts and then construct ontologies from the collaborative tags. The generated ontologies can be employed to organize and index user-generated multimedia data. Existing research lacks a principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human perspective. In contrast, we borrow the idea of a family of concepts called basic level concepts from cognitive psychology. These basic level concepts are frequently used by people in their daily life and when organizing human knowledge. In this paper, we extract ontologies with basic level concepts from collaborative tags. Furthermore, we model the effect of context and present a method for context-aware basic level concepts detection for ontology learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on context-aware basic level concept detection in collaborative tagging for the construction of ontologies. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were conducted on real datasets using the Open Directory Project (ODP) as a benchmark. The experimental results illustrate that ontologies extracted by our approach are more rational and human-oriented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Folksonomies – large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by independent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing information. In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

To enhance the performance of personalized service recommendation in collaborative tagging systems, not only tag information but also time and social relations information should be considered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method aiming at taking advantage of tag, time and users' social relations information for a preferable service recommendation. We first improve a simple tag-based recommendation method by a time-decay function. Then we develop a temporal social-based recommendation method which analyzes user familiarity and user preference similarity between friends. Based on these two steps we integrate them as a temporal tag-and social-based (TTS) recommendation algorithm. Experiment results indicate that our method outperforms general tag-based and social-based recommendation methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, like Mendeley, CiteULike, and BibSonomy, users can post, tag, visit, or export scholarly publications. In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage points. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={With the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies, folksonomy which is also known as social tagging or collaborative tagging is widely used by learners to annotate and categorize their learning resources. In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, have grown in popularity over the Web on account of their simplicity to organize several types of content (e.g., Web pages, pictures, and video) using open-ended tags. The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems. Current recommendation approaches stemming from fields such as user modeling, collaborative filtering, content, and link-analysis are reviewed and discussed to provide a starting point for researchers in the field as well as explore future research lines. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Tagging (or bookmarking) online resources with representative keywords is one of the most popular and practical approaches for giving identity to the objects. Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD. CODer Entrepreneurs in the automatically formed communities can dynamically improve identity of the entrepreneurial objects related to their expertise or interests.},

abstract={The success of intelligent tutoring system depends on the retrieval of relevant learning material according to the learner’s requirements. Therefore, the ultimate goal is development of the intelligent tutoring system that provides learning materials considering the requirements and understanding capability of the specific learner. In our previous research, we implemented a tutoring system named Protus 2.1 (PROgramming TUtoring System) that is used for learning basic concepts of Java programming language. It directs the learner’s activities and recommends relevant actions during the learning process based on the personal profile of each learner. This paper presents the implementation of collaborative tagging technique for content recommendation in Protus 2.1. This technique can be applied in intelligent tutoring systems for providing tag-enabled recommendations of concepts and resources. We investigated and identified tagging practices of students and their evolution over time. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the problem of tagging quality evaluation in collaborative tagging systems. By investigating the dynamics of tagging process, we find that high frequency tags almost cover the main aspects of a resource content and can be determined stable much earlier than a whole tag set. Motivated by this finding, we design the swapping index and smart moving index on tagging quality. We also study the correlations in tag usage and propose the semantic measurement on tagging quality. The proposed methods are evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient than previous methods, which are appropriate for a large number of web resources. The effectiveness is justified by the results in tag based applications. The light weight metrics bring a little loss on the performance, while the semantic metric is better than current methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={As an example of exploring human memory cue use in an ecologically valid context, we present ongoing work to examine the “memory cue hypothesis” in collaborative tagging. In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Web 2.0 communities, there has been a tremendous increase in user-generated content. Confronting such a vast volume of resources in collaborative tagging systems, users require a novel method for fast exploring and indexing so as to find their desired data. To this end, contextual information is indispensable and critical in understanding user preferences and intentions. In sociolinguistics, context can be classified as verbal context and social context. Compared with verbal context, social context requires not only domain knowledge to build pre-defined contextual attributes but also additional user data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed the issue of irrelevant contextual factors for the verbal context model. To bridge this gap, the dominating set obtained from verbal context is proposed in this paper. We present (i) the verbal context graph to model contents and interrelationships of verbal context in folksonomy and thus capture the user intention; (ii) a method of discovering dominating set that provides a good balance of essentiality and integrality to de-emphasize irrelevant contextual factors and to keep the major characteristics of the verbal context graph; and (iii) a revised ranking method for measuring the relevance of a resource to an issued query, a discovered context and an extracted user profile. The experimental results obtained for a public dataset illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than existing baseline approaches. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of user-generated data in collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy-based) systems due to the prevailing of Web 2.0 communities. To effectively assist users to find their desired resources, it is critical to understand user behaviors and preferences. Tag-based profile techniques, which model users and resources by a vector of relevant tags, are widely employed in folksonomy-based systems. This is mainly because that personalized search and recommendations can be facilitated by measuring relevance between user profiles and resource profiles. However, conventional measurements neglect the sentiment aspect of user-generated tags. In fact, tags can be very emotional and subjective, as users usually express their perceptions and feelings about the resources by tags. Therefore, it is necessary to take sentiment relevance into account into measurements. In this paper, we present a novel generic framework SenticRank to incorporate various sentiment information to various sentiment-based information for personalized search by user profiles and resource profiles. In this framework, content-based sentiment ranking and collaborative sentiment ranking methods are proposed to obtain sentiment-based personalized ranking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of integrating sentiment information to address the problem of the personalized tag-based search in collaborative tagging systems. Moreover, we compare the proposed sentiment-based personalized search with baselines in the experiments, the results of which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we study the influences by popular sentiment dictionaries, and SenticNet is the most prominent knowledge base to boost the performance of personalized search in folksonomy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Whether traditional TV or Internet multimedia content, parental control systems based on the intermediate filtering criteria of broadcasters or content producers may be not flexible enough. From parent’s perspective, the ideal scenario would be one in which they could dynamically decide about the suitability of any content. Since this desired scenario entails many practical problems, we propose an intermediate solution where parents delegate the decision of blocking any piece of TV content on a trustworthy set of parents. Our approach provides a collaborative parental control model based on two pillar: (1) a parenting social network where parents interact, freely give their opinion about TV content and tag this content (collaborative tagging); and (2) a model of trust relationship between parents. Regarding the deployment of parental control, we introduce a parental monitoring system for DVB-IPTV content, which is based on social technologies. The proposal combines information from the service provider and from parents in a social network to predict whether content should be blocked. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Social bookmarking and tagging has emerged a new era in user collaboration. Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users' Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

A controlled experiment of conceptual modeling was performed with experimental groups who received tags inducted from data of categorizations from Delicious and control groups who received terms extracted from Web pages categorized on Delicious. The results show that the experimental groups obtained less divergences (on average) in elicitation of terms when compared to control groups. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We study how categories form and develop over time in a sensemaking task by groups of students employing a collaborative tagging system. In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Dialogues are created by the interaction between people, who speak different kinds of topics using natural language. Task-oriented dialogue aims the solution of a given task in a given domain. Folksonomies are knowledge structures composed of users, tags and resources. Folksonomies emerge from the tagging process in collaborative tagging systems. Dialogues and folksonomies have in common their social dimension. One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process. This can be useful for instance, to retrieve the topics addressed by the interlocutors of the dialogues, in different time intervals. Experiments with a real-world task-oriented dialogue corpus were done.},

abstract={Social tags take an important role in exploratory search. In collaborative tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources with tags. The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Tourist Spot Recommender Systems (TSRS) help users to find the interesting locations/spots in vicinity based on their preferences. Enriching the list of recommended spots with contextual information such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts etc. may further add value to the systems. This paper proposes the concept of information enrichment for a tourist spot recommender system. Proposed system works in collaboration with a Tourist Spot Recommender System, takes the list of spots to be recommended to the current user and collects the current contextual information for those spots. A new score/rank is computed for each spot to be recommender based on the recommender’s rank and current context and sent back to the user. Contextual information may be collected by several techniques such as sensors, collaborative tagging (folksonomy), crowdsourcing etc. This paper proposes an approach for information enrichment using just in time location aware crowdsourcing. Location aware crowdsourcing is used to get current contextual information about a spot from the crowd currently available at that spot. Most of the contextual parameters such as traffic conditions, weather conditions, crowdedness etc. are fuzzy in nature and therefore, fuzzy inference is proposed to compute a new score/rank, with each recommended spot. The proposed system may be used with any spot recommender system, however, in this work a personalized tourist spot recommender system is considered as a case for study and evaluation. A prototype system has been implemented and is evaluated by 104 real users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The problems which occur during the process are analyzed and solutions are proposed. The structure of the folksonomy is also analyzed. It turns out to be a social network graph. Graph features, such as the path length, or the Jaccard similarity coefficient, are the input parameters for a machine learning classifying algorithm. The comparative importance of the parameters is evaluated. Finally, the method was evaluated in the RUSSE evaluation campaign. The results are lower than most results for distribution-based vector models. However, the model itself is cheaper to build.

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique (Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution), which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy (expressed in a FO) to support ontology review and enhancement.

abstract={Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, most social Websites allow users to annotate resources (such as Web pages and images) with keywords, i.e. tags. Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social tagging, also noted as collaborative tagging or folksonomy, is an important way for users themselves to describe resources on the Web. The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Taggers in social tagging systems have the main role in giv- ing identities to the objects. Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects. Be- cause our perceptions in each specific area of knowledge is evolving over time, the goal of our approach is also to evolve the represented knowledge in semantic tagging systems dy- namically according to the latest perception of the related users. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

abstract={With the advent of the so-called "Web 2.0", the participatory nature of many of its applications has nurtured the vision of many researchers to finally overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck inherent to many Semantic Web applications. Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

abstract={Compared with learning in classrooms, classical e-learning systems are less adaptive and once a system that supports a particular strategy has been designed and implemented, it is less likely to change according to student's interactions and preferences. Remote educational systems should be developed to ensure as much as necessary the personalization of learning tasks. New e-learning environments should appear to act as intelligent systems that better fit the needs of their users and especially students according to their interests, preferences, motivations, objectives and knowledge. In this paper, we present how the personalization of students' learning process leveraging the use of social semantic web, using resource description framework models, ontologies, social networking and collaborative tagging. Our aim is to develop an approach of personalization according to students' preferences, interests and knowledge by defining for them the best learning paths, this means, provide them as recommendations the best collaborators and the relevant resources that better fit their needs. We present a new method of recommendation based on users' similarity calculation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the design, implementation, analysis and evaluation of a social learning environment. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is one of the most popular services available online, and it allows end user to loosely classify either online or offline resources based on their feedback, expressed in the form of free-text labels (i.e., tags). Although tags may not be per se sensitive information, the wide use of collaborative tagging services increases the risk of cross referencing, thereby seriously compromising user privacy. In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

In relation, the study for such a need is usually limited to a number of product features only. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative tagging approach for discovering product features, affective description and their associations from product review analysis.

abstract={Abstract: Collaborative labeling portrays the process by which numerous users put in metadata in the form of keywords to shared data. Nowadays, collaborative labeling has grown in reputation on the web, on sites that permit users to label bookmarks, photographs and other details. It has been recently become useful and well known as one effective way of classifying items for future search, sharing information, and filtering. So, as to predict the future search of users, we propose a novel collaborative tagging-based page recommendation algorithm using fuzzy classifier. The method consists of three phases: Grouping, Rule Generation Phase and Page Recommendation Phase. In the proposed method, we calculate the resemblance of users in selecting tags and thereby, calculate the nearest neighbors of each user and cluster them. Then, the priority of tags and items for each user is calculated for constructing a Nominal Label Matrix and Nominal Page Matrix. Finally, the fuzzy rules are generated for page recommendation. The experimentation is carried out on delicious datasets and the experimental results ensured that the proposed algorithm has achieved the maximum hit ratio of 6.6% for neighborhood size of 20, which is higher than the existing technique which obtained only 5.5%. © 2014, Copyright: the authors.},

abstract={The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three components, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this paper, we develop a dual mining framework to explore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design four sets of efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article discusses the information representation process based on the Moscovici's Social Representation Theory and domain analysis in Information Science. The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the dataset, showed that the users' reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants - in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user's choice of resources, and sharing styles. Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a "gain scale" of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.},

abstract={Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the increase in resource-sharing websites such as YouTube and Flickr, many shared resources have arisen on the Web. Personalized searches have become more important and challenging since users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized searches need to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provides a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized searches. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in collaborative tagging systems. We use a normalized term frequency to indicate the preference degree of a user on a tag. A novel search method using such profiles of users and resources is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource searches. In our framework, instead of the keyword matching or similarity measurement used in previous works, the relevance measurement between a resource and a user query (termed the query relevance) is treated as a fuzzy satisfaction problem of a user's query requirements. We implement a prototype system called the Folksonomy-based Multimedia Retrieval System (FMRS). Experiments using the FMRS data set and the MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These 'social taxonomies', which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions -from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique - Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution -, which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy - expressed in a FO - to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In the era of big data, collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems have proliferated as a consequence of the growth of Web 2.0 communities. Constructing user profiles from folksonomy systems is useful for many applications such as personalized search and recommender systems. The identification of latent user communities is one way to better understand and meet user needs. The behavior of users is highly influenced by the behavior of their neighbors or community members, and this can be utilized in constructing user profiles. However, conventional user profiling techniques often encounter data sparsity problems as data from a single user is insufficient to build a powerful profile. Hence, in this paper we propose a method of enriching user profiles based on latent user communities in folksonomy data. Specifically, the proposed approach contains four sub-processes: (i) tag-based user profiles are extracted from a folksonomy tripartite graph; (ii) a multi-faceted folksonomy graph is constructed by integrating tag and image affinity subgraphs with the folksonomy tripartite graph; (iii) random walk distance is used to unify various relationships and measure user similarities; (iv) a novel prototype-based clustering method based on user similarities is used to identify user communities, which are further used to enrich the extracted user profiles. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a public dataset, the results of which show that our approach outperforms previous ones in user profile enrichment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A folksonomy is ostensibly an information structure built up by the "wisdom of the crowds", but is the "crowd" really doing the work? Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Background: The public typically believes psychotherapy to be more effective than pharmacotherapy for depression treatments. This is not consistent with current scientific evidence, which shows that both types of treatment are about equally effective. Objective: The study investigates whether this bias towards psychotherapy guides online information search and whether the bias can be reduced by explicitly providing expert information (in a blog entry) and by providing tag clouds that implicitly reveal experts' evaluations. Methods: A total of 174 participants completed a fully automated Web-based study after we invited them via mailing lists. First, participants read two blog posts by experts that either challenged or supported the bias towards psychotherapy. Subsequently, participants searched for information about depression treatment in an online environment that provided more experts' blog posts about the effectiveness of treatments based on alleged research findings. These blogs were organized in a tag cloud; both psychotherapy tags and pharmacotherapy tags were popular. We measured tag and blog post selection, efficacy ratings of the presented treatments, and participants' treatment recommendation after information search. Results: Participants demonstrated a clear bias towards psychotherapy (mean 4.53, SD 1.99) compared to pharmacotherapy (mean 2.73, SD 2.41; t173=7.67, P<.001, d=0.81) when rating treatment efficacy prior to the experiment. Accordingly, participants exhibited biased information search and evaluation. This bias was significantly reduced, however, when participants were exposed to tag clouds with challenging popular tags. Participants facing popular tags challenging their bias (n=61) showed significantly less biased tag selection (F2,168=10.61, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.112), blog post selection (F2,168=6.55, P=.002, partial eta squared=0.072), and treatment efficacy ratings (F2,168=8.48, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.092), compared to bias-supporting tag clouds (n=56) and balanced tag clouds (n=57). Challenging (n=93) explicit expert information as presented in blog posts, compared to supporting expert information (n=81), decreased the bias in information search with regard to blog post selection (F1,168=4.32, P=.04, partial eta squared=0.025). No significant effects were found for treatment recommendation (Ps>.33). Conclusions: We conclude that the psychotherapy bias is most effectively attenuated-and even eliminated-when popular tags implicitly point to blog posts that challenge the widespread view. Explicit expert information (in a blog entry) was less successful in reducing biased information search and evaluation. Since tag clouds have the potential to counter biased information processing, we recommend their insertion. © Holly O Witteman.},

abstract={Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={With the rapid increasing rate of the high volume of social web contents due to the growing popularity of social media services, significant attention has been drawn towards recommender systems i.e. systems, that offer recommendations to users on items appropriate to their requirements. To offer suitable recommendations, the systems need comprehensive user and item models that would be able to provide thorough understanding of their characteristics and preferences. In this article, a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns, and to enrich each individual profile by a two-phase profile enrichment procedure. The profiles are extended by association rules discovered through the association rule mining process. The user/item profiles are further enriched through collaboration with other similar user/item profiles. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental result s demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={With the development of the Internet, there are more and more shared resources on the Web. Personalized search becomes increasingly important as users demand higher retrieval quality. Personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags (features) and thus provide a powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. To capture and understand user preferences, a user is typically modeled as a vector of tag:value pairs (i.e., a tag-based user profile) in collaborative tagging systems. In such a tag-based user profile, a user's preference degree on a group of tags (i.e., a combination of several tags) mainly depends on the preference degree on every individual tag in the group. However, the preference degree on a combination of tags (a tag-group) cannot simply be obtained from linearly combining the preference on each tag. The combination of a user's two favorite tags may not be favorite for the user. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To overcome their problems, we model a user profile based on combinations of tags (tag-groups) and then apply it to the personalized search. By comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results on a real data set shows the effectiveness of our proposed user profile method.

abstract={Classifying complex artistic objects, such as popular songs, raises important issues to knowledge organization studies. Historically, the popular song has been classified as a subcategory of other musical objects. However, recent researches show that the popular song is a specific artistic form that is endowed with its own language and, therefore, demands specific techniques for analysis, representation and, consequently, classification. Considering the different approaches toward popular songs in catalogues and contemporary systems, this paper identifies possible solutions, such as the use of descriptive metadata, the use of collaborative tagging or the creation of an ontology. In discussing the construction of an epistemological foundation used specifically for classifying the popular song, we reflect on the remaining challenges for the knowledge organization of complex artistic documents.},

abstract={Recently collaborative tagging, also known as "folksonomy" in Web 2.0, allows users to collaboratively create and manage tags to classify and categorize dynamic content for searching and sharing. A user's interest in social resources usually changes with time in such a dynamic and information rich environment. Additionally, a social network is one innovative characteristic in social resource sharing websites. The information from a social network provides an inference of a certain user's interests based on the interests of this user's network neighbors. To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user's social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the "social friends" network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system's performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user's preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

abstract={With the proliferation of social media, it is becoming important to support a significant amount of user tags in selecting the most appropriate resource description during the search process. In this paper, we propose to identify and structure the links between resources by taking into account a resource social dimension. Each resource is assigned to a cluster of tags hierarchy. The clusters of tags are formed by a classification method while the hierarchical classification of tags within clusters is defined using a hierarchy classification algorithm. User's query is expanded by a social dimension and the clusters of tags are used to facilitate the search and ranking process. The results of our experiment, crawled from Delicious Folksonomy, demonstrate significant improvement over traditional retrieval approaches. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content sites has created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions on various items such as e-commerce products, restaurants, etc. Ideally, a user wants to quickly decide whether an item is desirable, from the list of items returned as a result of her search query. This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.

This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies. © 2013 IEEE.},

Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

A Rules Engine is used to manage a set of rules for each user to achieve personalized recommendation. The rules which define the relationship between tags construct the relationship graph model for users and learning resources thus graph-based collaborative filtering recommendation methods can be implemented.

abstract={With the rapid growth of web 2.0 technologies, tagging become much more important today to facilitate personal organization and also provide a possibility for users to search information or discover new things with Collaborative Tagging Systems. However, the simplistic and user-centered design of this kind of systems cause the task of finding personally interesting users is becoming quite out of reach for the common user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation. This is because CF always been attack by malicious users that will make it suffers in finding the truly interesting users. With this problem in mind, this study proposes a hybrid User Trust method to enhance CF in order to increase accuracy of user recommendation in social tagging system. This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. In addition, it indicated that the hybrid method give more accurate recommendation than the existing CF based on user trust. © 2013 Science Publications.},

abstract={In the existing user modeling methods for collaborative tagging systems, a user is regarded as a tag-vector and it is assumed to be interested in every tag in the tag-vector. Moreover, only the matching degree of a tag with another tag is calculated, while the effects of tags as a whole on the user's preference are ignored. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on the tag-group effect, namely, TGER. This algorithm utilizes the user ratings on resources to select the tag-groups which have significant effects on the user's preference, and adopts the high-dimension tag-group first matching method to calculate the user-resource relevance. Experimental results on the MovieLens data set show that TGER can significantly improve the recommendation quality.},

abstract={Graphs are a fundamental data structure and have been employed to model objects as well as their relationships. The similarity of objects on the web (e.g., webpages, photos, music, micro-blogs, and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects in many recent applications. SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N 2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O.n/.},

The framework we use shows the components that comprise the tagging system and how they interact together to direct tagging behaviour. We analysed two collaborative tagging systems: CiteULike and Delicious by studying their components by applying our framework. Using datasets from both systems, we found that 35% of CiteULike users did not provide tags compared to only 0.1% of Delicious users.

abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, such as web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Ontologies, folksonomy and personomy are employed in KAM to constitute the useful repositories of knowledge. Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction, very useful for capturing the semantics of information repositories, but they can not reflect the user's interest. The user in KAM can freely choose the words to tag the resources which are the reflection of the user's own interest. The set of tags and tagged knowledge of a user comprise the personomy. In a group the shared tags and knowledge are known as folksonomy. Our approach investigates how to map these tags in personomy and folksonomy to existing domain ontology in order to add accurate meanings. The user's behaviors are also used to re-rank the query results. So the user can find the useful knowledge quickly and accurately.},

abstract={Some of the most remarkable innovative technologies from the Web 2.0 are the collaborative tagging systems. They allow the use of folksonomies as a useful structure for a number of tasks in the social web, such as navigation and knowledge organization. One of the main deficiencies comes from the tagging behaviour of different users which causes semantic heterogeneity in tagging. As a consequence a user cannot benefit from the adequate tagging of others. In order to solve the problem, an agent-based reconciliation knowledge system, based on Formal Concept Analysis, is applied to facilitate the semantic interoperability between personomies. This article describes experiments that focus on conceptual structures produced by the system when it is applied to a collaborative tagging service, Delicious. Results will show the prevalence of shared tags in the sharing of common resources in the reconciliation process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={As a storage and retrieval unit of user generated web objects, set has been receiving increased attention recently in information retrieval research community. Set search requires relevant sets to be retrieved to meet information needs of users. It is different from individual object search in terms of content granularity. While a web object itself is not divisible and independent with each other, a set consists of separable objects that are related in some aspects. This paper proposes a new approach that can effectively measure topical relevance of sets against a user query by utilizing the tags attached to web objects. The main idea of the proposed approach is to prefer the set which covers as many query related subtopics as possible. In particular, in order to compute the topical relevance while addressing the problem of noisy tags, the notion of tag significance score is introduced based on tag co-occurrence frequency. We consider a problem domain of photo set search at flickr.com where individual photos are annotated with texts such as titles and tags. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous approaches for photo set retrieval. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Our work is supported by (1) the logs generated after query searching, (2) semantic annotations of queries and (3) semantic annotations of web pages. The algorithm makes use of this information to elaborate an appropriate ranking. To validate our approach we have implemented a system that can apply the algorithm to a particular search engine. Evaluation results show that the number of relevant web resources obtained after executing a query with the algorithm is higher than the one obtained without it. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Tagging is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 web sites. A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as a common solution for labelling and organising online digital content. However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a semantically enhanced tag-based approach to music recommendation. While most of approaches to tag-based recommendation are based on tag frequency, our approach is based on semantics of tags. In order to extract semantics of tags, we developed the emotion ontology for music called UniEmotion, which categorizes tags into positive emotional tags, negative emotional tags, and factual tags. According to the types of the tags, their weights are calculated and assigned to them. After then, user profiles using the weighted tags were generated and a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm was executed. To evaluate our approach, a data set of 1,100 users, tags which they added, and artists which they listened to was collected from last.fm. The conventional track-based recommendation, the unweighted tag-based recommendation, and the weighted tag-based recommendation are compared in terms of precision. Our experimental results show that the weighted tag-based recommendation outperforms other two approaches in terms of precision. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Background: Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. Objective: The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. Methods: First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. Results: Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the so-called Web 2.0 has changed the surfers' behavior. A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={While recommendation approaches exploiting different input sources have started to proliferate in the literature, an explicit study of the effect of the combination of heterogeneous inputs is still missing. On the other hand, in this context there are sides to recommendation quality requiring further characterisation and methodological research - a gap that is acknowledged in the field. We present a comparative study on the influence that different types of information available in social systems have on item recommendation. Aiming to identify which sources of user interest evidence - tags, social contacts, and user-item interaction data - are more effective to achieve useful recommendations, and in what aspect, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering, and social recommenders on three datasets obtained from Delicious, Last. fm, and MovieLens. Aiming to determine whether and how combining such information sources may enhance over individual recommendation approaches, we extend the common accuracy-oriented evaluation practice with various metrics to measure further recommendation quality dimensions, namely coverage, diversity, novelty, overlap, and relative diversity between ranked item recommendations. We report empiric observations showing that exploiting tagging information by content-based recommenders provides high coverage and novelty, and combining social networking and collaborative filtering information by hybrid recommenders results in high accuracy and diversity. This, along with the fact that recommendation lists from the evaluated approaches had low overlap and relative diversity values between them, gives insights that meta-hybrid recommenders combining the above strategies may provide valuable, balanced item suggestions in terms of performance and non-performance metrics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={While research on collaborative tagging systems has largely been the purview of computer scientists, the behavior of these systems is driven by the psychology of their users. Here we explore how simple models of boundedly rational human decision making may partly account for the high-level properties of a collaborative tagging environment, in particular with respect to the distribution of tags used across the folkson-omy. We discuss several plausible heuristics people might employ to decide on tags to use for a given item, and then describe methods for testing evidence of such strategies in real collaborative tagging data. Using a large dataset of annotations collected from users of the social music website Last.fm with a novel crawling methodology (approximately one millions total users), we extract the parameters for our decision-making models from the data. We then describe a set of simple multi-agent simulations that test our heuristic models, and compare their results to the extracted parameters from the tagging dataset. Results indicate that simple social copying mechanisms can generate surprisingly good fits to the empirical data, with implications for the design and study of tagging systems.},

abstract={Tags can be used to annotate resources on the web. This enables users to share or browse the resources or retrieve them in future. Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a general method to build linear-interpretable user profiles that can be used for user interaction in a recommender system, using the well-known simple additive weighting model (SAW) for multi-attribute decision making. In experiments, two kinds of user profiles where tested: one from free contributed tags and other from keywords automatically extracted from textual item descriptions. We compare them for their ability to predict ratings and their potential for user interaction. As a test bed, we used a subset of the database of the University of Minnesota's movie review system-Movielens, the social tags proposed by Vig et al. (2012) in their work "The Tag Genome", and movie synopses extracted from the Netflix's API. We found that, in "warm" scenarios, the proposed tag and keyword-based user profiles produce equal or better recommendations that those based on latent-factors obtained using matrix factorization. Particularly, the keyword-based approach obtained 5.63% of improvement. In cold-start conditions-movies without rating information, both approaches perform close to average. Moreover, a user profile visualization is proposed arising an accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff between tag and keyword-based profiles. While keyword-based profiles produce more accurate recommendations, tag-based profiles seems to be more readable, meaningful and convenient for creating profile-based user interfaces.

abstract={Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend tags to a user for a given item. In this paper we propose an adaptation of the search algorithms proposed in [14, 1] to the tag recommendation problem. Our algorithm, called STRec, provides networkaware recommendations based on proximity measures computed on-the-fly in the network. STRec uses a bounded search to find good neighbors. On top of STRec, we apply a re-ranking scheme that improves the quality of the recommendations. We update the ranking according to the degree of association between the higher ranked tags and the lower ranked ones. This technique leads to better recommendations as we show in this paper and could be applicable on top of many recommender systems. The experiments we did on several datasets demonstrated the efficiency of our approach.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are based on assigning keywords freely chosen by users, which promotes ressources sharing and organization by the way and improves the information retrieval. The tags allocation by users is illustrated particularly in sites sharing photos or videos (Flickr, YouTube). As navigations and clicks, tags can be good indicators of the user's interests. In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based profile extraction. We believe that for a better result, tags of a resource must represent well its content. Existing systems consider 'Popularity' as the unique criterion to judge the tag effectiveness. But it does not always reflect its importance and representativeness to the resource. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on tag strength to represent a user. In which we introduce weighted tags based on user expertise. Copyright © 2013 SCITEPRESS.},

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions-from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E steps technique-Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution-which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy-expressed in a FO-to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular tools for Web search users to find their desired information. Indeed, the informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. The widely keyword-based approaches used for locating information on the Web, are hence not straightforwardly adaptable to folksonomies. This drawback has created the need for an effective framework to support folksonomy users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this paper is to propose an integrated approach for context-aware query recommendation infolksonomies that exploits the power of both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and triadic concepts. We demonstrate through carried out experiments that the proposed approach yields mainly highly Precise and highly Relevant tag query recommendation.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the growth patterns of tag vocabulary in collaborative tagging systems to verify the sustainability and stabilization of tag distributions. Both sustainability and stabilization are essential to the mining and categorization of information driven by tagging behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on time series data of CiteULike from November 2004 to April 2010. Power law distributions were detected to reveal statistical regularities and tagging patterns. Logistic regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted to identify the factors affecting the growth of distinct tags for articles. The significance of the effects and the time taken for a given article to reach its tagging maturity were also explored. Findings - Time series plots and trend analysis illustrated the continuous growth of the tagging system. Exploratory analysis of power law distribution fittings indicated a sign of system stability known as scale invariance. Logistic regression results demonstrated that for a particular article, the number of users who tagged the article, the initial date when the article was tagged, and the life span of the article are statistically significant to the ratio of the distinct tag number to the total tag number for a given article. These results confirmed that the distinct tag ratio of an article gives rise to a stable pattern. Originality/value - Though extensive work has been done on the patterns of tag vocabulary, it is not clear how the growth of distinctive tags behaves in relation to the total number of tag applications, considering time-dependent covariates such as the number of users, and the longevity of an article. This paper sets to complement the literature on the existing methodology and investigate this property in detail. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Social Web makes visible the ebb and flow of popular interest in topics both newsworthy (\GulfSpill") and trivial (\Lolcat"). Understanding this emergent behavior is a fun- damental goal for Social Web research. Key problems in- clude discovering emergent topics from online text sources, modeling burst activity, and predicting the future trajec- tory of a given topic. Past work has addressed such prob- lems individually for specific applications, but has lacked a generalizable framework for performing both classification and prediction of topic usage. Our approach is to model a topic as a temporally ordered sequence of derived feature states and capture characteristic changes in the topic trend. These sequences are drawn from a dynamic segmentation of frequency data based on change point analysis. We employ Partitioning Around Medoids clustering on these segments to produce signatures which highlight characteristic patterns of usage growth and decay. We demonstrate how this signa- ture model can be used to define distinctive classes of topics in multiple online contexts, including tagging systems and web-based information retrieval. Additionally, we show how the model can predict the general trajectory of interest in a particular topic. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Many software engineering tasks, such as feature location and duplicate bug report detection, leverages similarities among textual corpora. However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Originally introduced by social bookmarking systems, collaborative tagging, or social tagging, has been widely adopted by many web-based systems like wikis, e-commerce platforms, or social networks. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Nevertheless, using ontologies alone has some weaknesses due to the need of being statically modeled by a set of experts in a specific domain.

abstract={A new collaborative approach in information organization and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI), which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric. The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree. The results of this study can be applicable to the study of filtering social tags based on CI; filtered social tags may be utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as an efficient way to semantically describe online resources shared by a community of users. However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users. We analyze the performance of two probabilistic approaches to recommend tags from users with similar tagging behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={As the number of Web services dramatically increases, it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for user to find the desired Web services. Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between cooccurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging services allow users to freely assign tags to resources. As the large majority of users enters only very few tags, good tag recommendation can vastly improve the usability of tags for techniques such as searching, indexing, and clustering. Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases, where a dimension is a set of mutually exclusive itemsets. The problem we consider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying on information-theoretic concepts, we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity, and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard, and we propose a greedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is equipped with strategies for pruning the search space deriving directly from the objective function. We also prove a property that allows assessing the level of informativeness for newly added dimensions, thus allowing to define criteria for terminating the decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets with known dimension and three real-world datasets, flickr, del. icio. us and dblp. The problem we study is largely motivated by applications in the domain of collaborative tagging; however, the mining task we introduce in this paper is useful in other application domains as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is attracting a growing community in the arts museums as manifested by several initiatives such as the Steve Museum project and the Posse initiative at the Brooklyn Museum. The driving force for these projects is the quest for increased and improved access to artifact collections such as art collections. Previous results of studying the nature of tags provided by users reveal that these tags have little overlap with museum documentation; but on the other hand, there is good overlapping with terms from vocabulary sources such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). This paper reports a case study that we performed where the aim was to include tags provided by "average" users from the broader community, not necessarily closely related to the art field as it was the focus of the previous studies. The study we performed comparing tags generated by average users, expert users and metadata seems to indicate the unique role that tags provided by average users would play in facilitating the interaction with art digital libraries. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Folksonomies have shown to contain information that is beneficial for resource recommendation. However, as folksonomies are not designed to support recommendation tasks, there are drawbacks of the various recommendation techniques. Graphbased recommendation in folksonomies for example suffers from the problem of concept drift. Vector space based recommendation approaches in folksonomies suffer from sparseness of available data. In this paper, we propose the exible framework VSScore which incorporates context-specific information into the recommendation process to tackle these issues. Additionally, as an alternative to the evaluation methodology LeavePostOut we propose an adaptation Leave- RTOut for resource recommendation in folksonomies. In a subset of resource recommendation tasks evaluated, the proposed recommendation framework VSScore performs signifi cantly more effective than the baseline algorithm FolkRank.

abstract={With ubiquitous access to Web 2.0 applications, users on social networks can now collaboratively author and share hypermedia learning resources, contributing to more engaging learning experiences in Technology-Enhanced Learning outside formal education. Though these resources are ready to be harnessed for educational purposes, they may or may not be educational or may be suitable for some users only. Hence, it is crucial to annotate these resources to personalize these resources to different user needs. We propose to annotate learning resources with folksonomy-derived description metadata for personalization to context profiles of users. A semantic model for folksonomy was formulated to integrate controlled vocabularies in folksonomy. It not only reduces reliance on domain experts in annotating learning resources but also opens new avenues for more comprehensive resource description, compared to numerical ratings in resource recommendation algorithm. The working principle of the resource annotation and recommendation mechanism is demonstrated via a prototype system implemented in a social network environment. A pilot user study shows that learners are positive about the system in terms of aspects apart from accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Popular Internet document repositories, such as online newspapers, digital libraries, and blogs store large amount of text and image data that are frequently accessed by large number of users. Users' input through collaborative commenting or tagging can be very useful in organizing and classifying documents. Some web sites (e.g. Google Image Labeler) support a collection of tags and labels, but a large fraction of these sites do not currently support such activities. Moreover, relying upon centrally controlled web-service providers for such support is probably not a good idea if the objective is to make the collaborative inputs publicly available. Often, business entities offering such web-based tagging environments end up owning and monetizing the result of the collective effort. This paper takes a step toward addressing this problem-it proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (PADMINI), powered by distributed data mining algorithms. In particular, it focuses on learning a P2P classifier from tagged text data. This paper describes the PADMINI system and the distributed text classifier learning components; text classification is posed as a linear program and an asynchronous distributed algorithm is used to solve it. It also presents extensive empirical results on text data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proposal abstract database. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Recent years have seen an increasing diffusion of online communities giving their members the ability of specifying and sharing metadata concerning online resources. Such practice, also known as social or collaborative tagging, has the purpose of collecting and sharing opinions about Web resources and simplifying their retrieval. In this paper, we go one step further and show how tags can have more enhanced applications to be exploited for customizing Web content fruition. More precisely, we propose a multi-layer framework where data collected by social tagging communities are complemented with additional services. Such services provide users the ability of expressing their dis/agreement with existing tags, denoting the members they trust based on their characteristics and relationships, or specifying policies on which "quality" assessment of resources should be returned. Besides providing the formal specification of the proposed framework, we illustrate two case studies we have implemented and the experiments we have carried out in order to verify the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites, facilitating ordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i. e., Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Social or collaborative tagging systems emerged as a novel classification scheme on the Web based on the collective knowledge of people. In sites such as Del.icio.us, Technorati or Flickr, users annotate a variety of resources, including Web pages, blogs, pictures, videos or bibliographic references; using freely chosen textual labels or tags. Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web. In this paper we present an empirical study carried out to determine the value of tags in resource classification. Furthermore, the use of several filtering and pre-processing operations to reduce the ambiguity and noise in tags are analyzed to determine whether they allow to increase the quality of resource classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this manuscript we present a method that leverages social media for the effortless learning of object detectors. We are motivated by the fact that the increased training cost of methods demanding manual annotation, limits their ability to easily scale in different types of objects and domains. At the same time, the rapidly growing social media applications have made available a tremendous volume of tagged images, which could serve as a solution for this problem. However, the nature of annotations (i.e. global level) and the noise existing in the associated information (due to lack of structure, ambiguity, redundancy, and emotional tagging), prevents them from being readily compatible (i.e. accurate region level annotations) with the existing methods for training object detectors. We present a novel approach to overcome this deficiency using the collective knowledge aggregated in social sites to automatically determine a set of image regions that can be associated with a certain object. We study theoretically and experimentally when the prevailing trends (in terms of appearance frequency) in visual and tag information space converge into the same object, and how this convergence is influenced by the number of utilized images and the accuracy of the visual analysis algorithms. Evaluation results show that although the models trained using leveraged social media are inferior to the ones trained manually, there are cases where the user contributed content can be successfully used to facilitate scalable and effortless learning of object detectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We use this methodology for evaluating how tag recommendations coming from (1) the popular tags at a resource or from (2) the user's own vocabulary influence the indexing quality. We show that recommending popular tags decreases the indexing quality and that recommending the user's own vocabulary increases the indexing quality. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

In order to analyze and compare these initiatives we present here an abstract framework. It supports our argument that existing approaches do not explore the full potential of the combination between folksonomies and ontologies due to their unidirectionality. The framework is also the basis to evidence that a fusion approach - -as proposed in our "folksonomized ontology" - -enables to better explore the organic semantics of folksonomies combined to the engineered semantics of ontologies. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging platforms allow users to describe resources with freely chosen keywords, so called tags. The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={We demonstrate the Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tagging systems (also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items from a public pool of items (e.g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a query should be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers' search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully-personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. In this paper an intelligent tag recommendation agent is proposed, that recommends tags for bookmarks stored in one of the popular social bookmarking websites, Del.ici.ou.1 We develop various probabilistic approaches to recommend tags to be used by users while adding new bookmarks. We have developed content-based and collaborative filtering mechanism that are used by these recommendation agents. Additionally, these tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. This approach can therefore be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for social networks. We also empirically verify the hypothesis that similar web pages are tagged with similar tags. We also present a comparison between the proposed recommendation approaches for the agents. © 2012 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Due to the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, the research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other related concepts is becoming an important interdisciplinary area with great potential and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely 'flat', while in some cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags. However, usually no overall hierarchical organization of the tags is given, and one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there are also other types of tagged networks available for research, where the tags are already organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the 'is a sub-category of' type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper, we study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes marked by the tags in various real networks. The motivation for this research was the fact that understanding the tagging based on a known hierarchy can help in revealing the hidden hierarchy of tags in collaborative tagging systems.We analyse the relation between the tagfrequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG (i.e. their rank or significance as characterized by, e.g., the length of the branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features of tag co-occurrence. This model has high potential for further practical applications, e.g., it can provide the starting point for a benchmark system in ontology retrieval or it may help pinpoint unusual correlations in the co-occurrence of tags. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging have emerged as a ubiquitous way to annotate and organize online resources. As a kind of descriptive keyword, large amount of tags are created and associated to multiple types of resources, e. g., web pages, photos, videos and tweets. Users' tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing the temporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web. Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However, there exist remarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect bursty tagging event, which captures the relations among a group of correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It profiles the events with more representative and comprehensible clues. The proposed approach is divided into three stages. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events. We discuss the choice of similarity and granularity for event detection. After that, we further utilize an automatically generated tag taxonomy to organize bursty events to facilitate the burst oriented navigation and analysis. The experimental study on a large real data set demonstrates the superiority of our new approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

These characteristics may be considered as content-based approach, collaborative filtering demographic filtering and hybrid recommender systems. Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommender systems. These methods are based on collecting and analyzing the information of a particular user behavior, activity, preferences and will predict the user's interest according to the similarity of other users. In this paper we address the problem of scalability associated with CF and propose a CF framework that combines collaborative tagging with genre interestingness measure for a movie RS. Our experiments on each movie dataset with recent timestamp demonstrate that the proposed CFT -GIM gives more accurate predictions of user's ratings as compared to both CF and CFT.},

abstract={Turning Web services into Semantic Web Services (SWS) can be prohibitively expensive for large repositories. In such cases collecting community descriptions in forms of structured tags can be a more affordable approach to describe Web services. However, little is understood about how tagging impacts performance of retrieval. There are neither real structured tagging systems for Web services, nor real corpora of structured tags. To start addressing these issues, in our approach, we motivated taggers to tag services in a partially controlled environment. Specifically, taggers were given application requirements and asked to find and tag services that match the requirements. Tags collected in this way were used for Web service matchmaking and evaluated within the framework of the Cross-Evaluation Track of the Third Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest. As part of the lessons learned, we explain relations between description schema (SWS, tags, flat document) and matchmaking heuristics, and performance of retrieval in different search scenarios. We also analyze reliability of tagging system performance as related to taggers/searchers autonomy. Finally, we identify threats to results credibility stemming from partial control of the tags collection process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={The cross-sections of the Social Web and the Semantic Web has put folksonomy in the spot light for its potential in overcoming knowledge acquisition bottleneck and providing insight for "wisdom of the crowds". Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

abstract={In recent years, there is a fast proliferation of collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems in Web 2.0 communities. With the increasingly large amount of data, how to assist users in searching their interested resources by utilizing these semantic tags becomes a crucial problem. Collaborative tagging systems provide an environment for users to annotate resources, and most users give annotations according to their perspectives or feelings. However, users may have different perspectives or feelings on resources, e.g., some of them may share similar perspectives yet have a conflict with others. Thus, modeling the profile of a resource based on tags given by all users who have annotated the resource is neither suitable nor reasonable. We propose, to tackle this problem in this paper, a community-aware approach to constructing resource profiles via social filtering. In order to discover user communities, three different strategies are devised and discussed. Moreover, we present a personalized search approach by combining a switching fusion method and a revised needs-relevance function, to optimize personalized resources ranking based on user preferences and user issued query. We conduct experiments on a collected real life dataset by comparing the performance of our proposed approach and baseline methods. The experimental results verify our observations and effectiveness of proposed method. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

abstract={When large groups work on a theme, they have the potential to produce a lot of useful knowledge, regardless of whether they are acting in a coordinated manner or individually. Spontaneously generated information has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. New technologies, such as blogs, Twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, enable the creation and dissemination of content in a relatively simple way. As a result, the aggregate body of knowledge is growing at an accelerated rate. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Research has shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. Research has shown that individuals respond quickly and massively to emergencies, and that they try to help with the situation. Thus, it seems like a logical step to attempt to harness collective knowledge for emergency management. Disaster relief groups and field command frequently suffer from lack of up to date information, which may be critical in a rapidly evolving situation. Some of this information could be generated by the crowd at large, enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for the introduction of collective knowledge in disaster relief and present architecture and examples of how this could be accomplished. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As the collaborative tagging systems such as Delicious, Flickr and Last.fm become more and more popular, a large amount of resources produced by publishers, together with rich semantic metadata, become available. There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Information representation in engineering design is currently dominated by top-down approaches such as taxonomies and ontologies. While top-down approaches provide support for computational reasoning, they are primarily limited due to their static nature, limited scope, and developer-centric focus. Bottom-up approaches, such as folksonomies, are emerging as means to address the limitations of top-down approaches. Folksonomies refer to collaborative classification by users who freely assign tags to design information. They are dynamic in nature, broad in scope, and are user focused. However, they are limited due to the presence of ambiguities and redundancies in the tags used by different people. Considering their complementary nature, the ideal approach is to use both top-down and bottom-up approaches in a synergistic manner. To facilitate this synergy, the goal in this paper is to present techniques for using dynamic folksonomies to extract global characteristics of the structure of design information, and to create hierarchies of tags that can guide the development of structured taxonomies and ontologies. The approach presented in this paper involves using (a) tools such as degree distribution and K-neighborhood connectivity analysis to extract the global characteristics of folksonomies and (b) set-based technique and hierarchical clustering to develop a hierarchy of tags. The approach is illustrated using data from a collective innovation platform that supports collaborative tagging for design information. It is shown that despite the flat nature of the folksonomies insights about the hierarchy in information can be gained. The effects of various parameters on the tag hierarchy are discussed. The approach has potential to be used synergistically with top-down approaches such as ontologies to support the next generation collaborative design platforms. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={With the fast development of the Internet, there are more and more learning resources including various multimedia resources on the Web. Meanwhile, e-learning becomes more popular and important due to its convenience and autonomy. However, how to help users conduct high quality resource retrieval remains a challenge and should be considered first for an e-learning system. The traditional indexing approach which classifies multimedia resources into predefined categories can hardly meet user demands. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems provide users with a simple but powerful mechanism to obtain required multimedia resources. Moreover, feedbacks made by users can be utilized to refine the retrieval results during the interactive process between users and systems. In this paper, we present an interactive tutoring system with personalized multimedia resource search, based on a collaborative tagging mechanism. We also describe several application scenarios in which content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is combined with collaborative tagging to facilitate interactive tutoring in our cooking recipe database system. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tagabstrcatsness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of wordabstrcatness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and Wikitaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data.},

abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases. A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive itemsets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and del.icio.us, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the popularity of collaborative tagging services and systems, the role of social tags in information organization and retrieval has become increasingly critical within the tagging system. Consequently, the resolution of semantic ambiguity of tag sense (i.e., meaning) plays an important role in the enhancement of information organization and retrieval in collaborative tagging applications. Our approach to tackle the task of automatic resolution of semantic ambiguity is based on the hypothesis that given a target tag, some of the co-occurring social tags that were selectively assigned by the same or by different people to the same resource can serve as a useful dataset. Four different methods (i.e., two LSA-based, LIN-based, and Cooccurrence method) for tag sense disambiguation are proposed and their results are compared, aiming to automatically rank the senses associated with a given target tag. The experimental results with a Delicious dataset indicate that LSA-w and LIN-based methods produce more stable performances, and suggest the same two methods for the Tag Sense Disambiguation task, particularly in the situation that the Boolean effect is more likely to arise.},

Current tag-based recommender systems mainly take the explicit structural information among users, resources and tags into consideration, while neglecting the important implicit semantic relationships hidden in tagging data.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

In this article, we propose a subject-centered model of collaborative tagging to account for the ternary cooccurrences involving users, items, and tags in such systems. Extending the well-established probabilistic latent semantic analysis theory for knowledge representation, our model maps the user, item, and tag entities into a common latent subject space that captures the "wisdom of the crowd" resulted from the collaborative tagging process. To put this model into action, we have developed a novel way to estimate the probabilistic subject- centeredmodel approximately in a highly efficient manner taking advantage of amatrix factorization method. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed approach delivers substantial performance improvement on the knowledge resource recommendation task over the state-of-the-art standard and tag-aware resource recommendation algorithms. © 2011 ACM.},

Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been widely adopted by social media websites to allow users to describe content with metadata tags. Tagging can greatly improve search results. We propose a cross-language social media retrieval system (CLSMR) to help users retrieve foreign-language tagged media content. We construct a Chinese to Korean CLSMR system that translates Chinese queries into Korean, retrieves content, and then translates the Korean tags in the search results back into Chinese. Our system translates NEs using a dictionary of bilingual NE pairs from Wikipedia and a pattern-based software translator which learns regular NE patterns from the web. The top-10 precision of YouTube retrieved results for our system was 0.39875. The K-C NE tag translation accuracy for the top-10 YouTube results was 77.6%, which shows that our translation method is fairly effective for named entities. A questionnaire given to users showed that automatically translated tags were considered as informative as a human-written summary. With our proposed CLSMR system, Chinese users can retrieve online Korean media files and get a basic understanding of their content with no knowledge of the Korean language. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a real-time interactive tagging system called SynTag for collaborative learning in lectures. The system allows students accessing the web-based interface to tag an ongoing lecture. The collective tagging outcomes are instantly visualized with a dynamic timeline chart to illustrate the assessment of all students. With SynTag, students not only engage in a lecture by the interactive tagging function, but also cooperate with each other to contextualize the lecture. According to the outcomes of students' collaborative tagging activities, the critical spatio-temporal segments of a lecture video are automatically generated as the wave-shape timeline chart. Through the peaks of the wave-shape timeline chart, the valuable video chips of the lecture can be easily highlighted and recognized. In the end of this paper, we demonstrate how the SynTag system contributes to the collaborative learning in undergraduate classes through quantitative and qualitative studies. Finally, we conclude with a discussion based on our evaluation for the improvements and potentials of our system in future works. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites has created new challenges and opportunities for designers of web items, such as electronics products, travel itineraries, popular blogs, etc. An increasing number of people are turning to online reviews and user-specified tags to choose from among competing items. This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The 'Collaborative Tagging' is gaining popularity on Web 2.0, this new generation of Web which makes user reader/writer. The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social network systems such as FaceBook and YouTube have played a significant role in capturing both explicit and implicit user preferences for different items in the form of ratings and tags. This forms a quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings. Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

abstract={Video summarisation is one of the most active fields in content-based video retrieval research. A new video summarisation scheme is proposed by this paper based on socially generated temporal tags. To capture users' collaborative tagging activities the proposed scheme maintains video bookmarks, which contain some temporal or positional information about videos, such as relative time codes or byte offsets. For each video all the video bookmarks collected from users are then statistically analysed in order to extract some meaningful key frames (the video equivalent of keywords), which collectively constitute the summary of the video. Compared with traditional video summarisation methods that use low-level audio-visual features, the proposed method is based on users' high-level collaborative activities, and thus can produce semantically more important summaries than existing methods. It is assumed that the video frames around the bookmarks inserted by users are informative and representative, and therefore can be used as good sources for summarising videos. Folksonomy, commonly called collaborative tagging, is a Web 2.0 method for users to freely annotate shared information resources with keywords. It has mostly been used for collaboratively tagging photos (Flickr), web site bookmarks (Del.icio.us), or blog posts (Technorati), but has never been applied to the field of automatic video summarisation. It is believed that this is the first attempt to utilise users' high-level collaborative tagging activities, instead of low-level audio-visual features, for video summarisation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={In this article, we discuss the notions of experts and expertise in resource discovery in the context of collaborative tagging systems. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. First, an expert should possess a high-quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource in turn depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it, forming a mutual reinforcement relationship. Second, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users discover them, thus bringing these resources to the attention of the community of users. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (spamming-resistant expertise analysis and ranking), which implements the above ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. Our experiments show that our assumptions on expertise in resource discovery, and SPEAR as an implementation of these ideas, allow us to promote experts and demote spammers at the same time, with performance significantly better than the original hypertext-induced topic search algorithm and simple statistical measures currently used in most collaborative tagging systems. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The site uses Formal Concept Analysis to infer semantic associations between objects and drive the navigation of its collection, and we promote an extension of its capability by rendering such functionality via Web Services. The Web Services architecture supports a system called the Virtual Museum of the Pacific - a content and knowledge acquisition tool that permits the machine synthesis of formal concepts and provides a Rich Internet Application in which to display and navigate them. The Web Services also permit the extensible association of digital objects by inducing new attributes and relationships from museum meta-data, and allows for the ability for users and stakeholders to upload, annotate and attach rich media, YouTube or Vimeo links, and voice narratives to the objects. By rendering these capabilities as an open API, we encourage a connected and open approach to the sharing of cultural heritage and provide platform for further research and development - making our application well suited for mobile devices, Web-based mashups, and data exchange between collection databases. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tag abstractness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of word abstractness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and WikiTaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

By leveraging social tagging, we propose a new personalized search method to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. Our approach first determines the similarities between resources and between tags. Thereafter, we build two models: a user-tag relation model that reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and a tag-item relation model that captures how a certain tag has been tagged to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly map the tags on the items depending on a particular user's query in order to find the most attractive media content relevant to the user needs. The experimental evaluations have shown the proposed method achieves better search results than state-of-the art algorithms in terms of accuracy and coverage. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably, the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the noise. Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with three-mode tensors, in order to capture the three-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multiway analysis, latent correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Moreover, a hybrid scheme is proposed that additionally considers content-based information that is extracted from items. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Last.fm), against both recent tag-aware and traditional (non tag aware) item recommendation algorithms indicates significant improvements in recommendation quality. Moreover, the experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid scheme. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper presents a method for the automatic classification of the resources of collaborative tagging systems, also called folksonomies. Folksonomies are an easy way of representing knowledge in Web 2.0 because of its simplicity. However, due to their characteristics, the information retrieval in these systems is more difficult than in classical knowledge representation systems. This method has a high degree of precision and recall, and may adjust these values with the use of different modes of classification and thresholds, improving the performances of other resource classification methods. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging mechanisms are integral to social computing applications in a variety of domains. Their expected benefits include simplified retrieval of digital content, as well as enhanced ability of a community to makes sense of the shared content. We examine the impact of collaborative tagging in context of nutrition management. In a controlled experiment we asked individuals to assess the nutritional value of meals based on photographic images and observed the impact of different types of tags and tagging mechanisms on individuals nutritional sensemaking. The results of the study show that tags enhance individuals' ability to remember the viewed meals. However, we found that some types of tags can be detrimental to sensemaking, rather than supporting it. These findings stress the importance of tagging vocabularies and suggest a need for expert moderation of community sensemaking. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

As folksonomies are gaining in popularity, the expert search and spammer detection in folksonomies attract more and more attention.

We first investigate a comprehensive set of expertise evidences related to users, objects and tags in folksonomies. Then we discuss the rich interactions between them and propose a unified Continuous CRF model to integrate these features and interactions.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is the practice of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize online content. Current collaborative tagging activities within medical blogs are done using free words chosen by users. These tags are not based on standard medical terminologies. The resulted tags are inefficient in terms of medical meanings and semantic interlinking capabilities. In this paper, MTag is presented as a new model for collaborative tagging in medical blogs, i.e. tagging blog entries with medical information. MTag includes two modules: the service module and the semantic module. The service module enables health professionals provide blog posts with auto-completed tags that represent actual medical terms and categorize their tags. Tags are mapped to URIs from online medical knowledge datasets to clarify their medical meaning. At the same time, the semantic module is equipped with a tag ontology which extends the Social Semantic Cloud of Tags (SCOT) ontology to consent medical specifications of tags. Eventually, a prototype is developed to test the MTag's two modules. The results show that both modules are working properly. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Folksonomy and tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. The concepts are organized as a map in human mind, however, the tags in folksonomy, which reflect users' collaborative cognition on information, are isolated with current approach. What we do in this paper is to estimate the semantic relatedness among tags in folksonomy: whether tags are related from semantic view, rather than isolated? We introduce different algorithms to form networks of folksonomy, connecting tags by users collaborative tagging, or by resource context. Then we perform multiple measures of semantic relatedness on folksonomy networks to investigate semantic information within them. The result shows that the connections between tags have relatively strong semantic relatedness, and the relatedness decreases dramatically as the distance between tags increases. What we find in this paper could provide useful visions in designing future folksonomy-based systems, constructing semantic web in current state of the Internet, and developing natural language processing applications.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have recently become very popular as a method of categorising information online and have been used to annotate a wide range of different resources. In such systems users are free to choose whatever keywords or "tags" they wish to annotate each resource, resulting in a highly personalised, unrestricted vocabulary. While this freedom of choice has several notable advantages, it does come at the cost of making searching of these systems more difficult as the vocabulary problem introduced is more pronounced than in a normal information retrieval setting. In this paper we propose to use hidden topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall. We first describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a simple topic model and then introduce 2 extended models which can be used to personalise the results by including information about the user who made each annotation. We test these 3 models and compare them with 3 non-topic model baselines on a large data sample obtained from the Delicious social bookmarking site. Our evaluations show that our methods significantly outperform all of the baselines with the personalised models also improving significantly upon unpersonalised LDA. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

In order to settle this problem we propose an improved recommendation algorithm based on collaborative tagging called personalized filtering (PF). PF defines and weighs the feature of tags using 4-D dataset, which can show latent personal interests and long-term personal interests. To decrease the computational complexity, PF constructs a top-N tags set to filter out the undersized dataset. To track the changes of personal interests, PF proposed a novel interest changing algorithm on the 4-D dataset. Some empirical experiments were done and the results shown that the sparsity level of PF is much lower and the computing speed is faster than traditional algorithms. © 2011 NSP.},

Current methods to provide such metadata are impractical for the volume of services published on the Web: they are too expensive to be implemented by a service broker, and too difficult to be used for retrieval. We introduce structured collaborative tagging to address these issues. Here, user tags not only aspects relevant for her but also suggested ones (input, output and behavior). Cost, performance and usability of the proposed technique obtained during the Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest are reported. Obtained results suggests that there is no "free lunch." While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as a mechanism to describe items in large on-line collections. Tags are assigned by users to describe and find back items, but it is also tempting to describe the users in terms of the tags they assign or in terms of the tags of the items they are interested in. The tag-based profile thus obtained can be used to recommend new items. If we recommend new items by computing their similarity to the user profile or to all items seen by the user, we run into the risk of recommending only neutral items that are a bit relevant for each topic a user is interested in. In order to increase user satisfaction many recommender systems not only optimize for accuracy but also for diversity. Often it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between accuracy and diversity. In this paper we introduce topic aware recommendation algorithms. Topic aware algorithms first detect different interests in the user profile and then generate recommendations for each of these interests. We study topic aware variants of three tag based recommendation algorithms and show that each of them gives better recommendations than their base variants, both in terms of precision and recall and in terms of diversity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={The informal setting of learning at work give rise for unique challenges to the field of technology enhanced learning systems. Personalized recommendations taking into account the current context of the individual knowledge worker are a powerful approach to overcome those challenges and effectively support the knowledge workers to meet their individual information needs. Basis for these recommendations to adopt to the current context of a knowledge worker can be provided by user models which reflects the topics knowledge workers are dealing with and their corresponding knowledge levels, but research has only focused on user modeling in settings with a static underlying domain model so far. We suggest to model the users' context based on the emergent topics they are dealing with and their individual current knowledge levels within these topics by extracting the necessary information from the user's past activities within the system. Based on data from an experiment with students learning a new topic with the help of a collaborative tagging system, we started to evaluate this approach and report on first results.},

abstract={With the widely use of collaborative tagging system nowadays, users could tag their favorite resources with free keywords. Tag recommendation technology is developed to help users in the process of tagging. However, most of the tag recommendation methods are merely based on the content of tagged resource. In this paper, it is argued that tags depend not only on the content of resource, but also on user preference. As such, a hybrid personalized tag recommendation method based on user preference and content is proposed. The experiment results show that the proposed method has advantages over traditional content-based methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Aiming to identify which are the sources of information (ratings, tags, social contacts, etc.) most valuable for recommendation, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering and social recommenders on a heterogeneous dataset obtained from Last.fm. Moreover, aiming to investigate whether and how fusion of such information sources can benefit individual recommendation approaches, we propose various metrics to measure coverage, overlap, diversity and novelty between different sets of recommendations. The obtained results show that, in Last.fm, social tagging and explicit social networking information provide effective and heterogeneous item recommendations.

Specifically, in the following, the users' social connections in consideration were groups. Unlike other studies which utilized groups inferred by data mining technologies, we used the information about the groups in which each user explicitly participated. The group activities are centered on common interests. People join a group to share and acquire information about a topic as a form of community of interest or practice. The information of this group activity may be a good source of information for the members. We tested whether adding the information from the users' own groups or group members to the traditional CF-based recommendations can improve the recommendation quality or not. The information about groups was combined with CF using a mixed hybridization strategy. We evaluated our approach in two ways, using the Citeulike data set and a real user study.

abstract={The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

Let us consider the case of collaborative tagging systems. These systems are an example of complex, self-organized and socially aware systems. The multi-agent systems paradigm coordinated by self-organization mechanisms was used in an effective way for the design and modeling of complex systems. In this paper, we propose a model for the design and development of a new collaborative tagging system, MySURF (My Similar Users, Resources, Folksonomies), using a multi-agent system approach governed by the co-evolution of the social and spatial organizations of the agents. We show how the proposed system offers several new features that can improve current collaborative tagging systems, including clustering of resources and building users' profiles. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems (CTS) enable Internet users to annotate for resources using custom tags, and the tags reflect the user interest and thus form a user profile. However, the flexibility of tagging brings large number of synonymous and polysemous tags which make the use of these profile information to personalize resource recommendation difficult. We propose to use graph-based clustering to form groups of semantically-related tags in the offline stage. Then in the online stage the tag clusters act as an intermediary between users and resource and are utilized to personalize the query results in CTS. 5-fold cross-validation is performed on two data sets, the results are compared with two other algorithms. Results show that the algorithm proposed demonstrate much better personalization measured by the F-value, whilst the effect is more miraculous in a multi-topic than in a single-topic CTS. This observation suggests that in a multi-topic CTS tag clustering such as proposed in this paper is an important strategy. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Social resource sharing systems are central elements of the Web 2.0 and use the same kind of lightweight knowledge representation, called folksonomy. Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Results indicate a steady decrease in the number of unique tags over the four years, suggesting an increasing stability in the community vocabulary over time and the establishment of domain-specific vocabulary. Members reused each others' tags over time and exhibited increasingly collaborative tagging behaviour. Tag discrimination was high, with 4.11 distinct articles per tag. The stable and discriminatory nature of the community's tags suggests that collaborative tagging may serve as a useful resource for vocabulary choice or maintenance by KMS managers. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

abstract={With the increase of resource-sharing web sites such as YouTube1 and Flickr2, personalized search becomes more important and challenging, as users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy [11]) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in a collaborative tagging environment. A novel search method using such users' and resources' profiles is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource search. We implement a prototype system named as FMRS. Experiments using FMRS data set and MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2010 ACM.},

We examine data on tagging practices from the Delicious web site (delicious.com) and find that there is little support for any of these beliefs. Although users individually do seem to have a small set of tags that they use in a controlled and effective way, they also use very large sets of other tags in a much more haphazard way. These poorly managed tags obscure much of the collective sense making and implicit community structure. We derive some suggestions for improving collaborative tagging systems.

abstract={Collaboration and information sharing among government organizations is becoming increasingly important for promoting efficiency and productivity as well as for enhancing citizen services. With Internet connectivity widely available and with the ease-of-use of social media tools, citizens actively participate in producing content. However, the abundance of content causes another problem for governments-the difficulty of determining what truly useful and relevant information is to be shared for mission critical tasks and to produce better citizen services. Information resources, such as data, documents, multimedia objects and services stored in different agencies and produced by citizens need to be easily discovered and shared. We propose a data model of rich social tags and a Citizen-Government collaborative tagging environment} where governments and citizens can collaboratively annotate the resources, thus facilitating collaboration responsiveness through accessibility to information. The collaborative annotations capture not only the semantics but also the pragmatic and social aspects related to the resources, such as who, when, where, how and for what related tasks the resources are shared. The benefits of the a rich tag data model emphasizing the relationships of a tag to semantic, social, pragmatic and contextual reference frames include the ability to filter, discover and search new and dynamic as well as hidden resources, to navigate between resources in a search by traversing semantic relationships, and to recommend the most relevant government information even when distributed over different agencies. A distributed architecture of a government collaborative tagging system is proposed and tag-based search and recommendations are illustrated. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Researching the emergence of semantics in social systems needs to take into account how users process information in their cognitive system. We report results of an experimental study in which we examined the interaction between individual expertise and the basic level advantage in collaborative tagging. The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

abstract={The content of collaborative tagging systems (so-called folksonomies) is generated, consumed, and annotated by the endusers. Users annotate and categorise their data using free-keywords, so-called tags. Consequently, several linguistic problems come to the surface in folksonomies such as; synonyms, polysemy, multilinguality, and others which produce ambiguous and inconsistent classification of data. Therefore, relevant results are not retrieved in the user's query. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to enhance the "social vocabulary" presented in folksonomies with the "controlled vocabulary" presented in Semantic Web ontologies. Therefore, our proposed approach uses the online WordNet lexical ontology in addition to the EuroWordNet multilingual lexical resource. Our approach tries to employ the ontological relations presented in WordNet in the folksonomy, it focuses only on the problems of synonyms, tag relations, and multilinguality.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the "noise". Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with 3-mode tensors, in order to capture the 3-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multi-way analysis, latent semantic correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Nevertheless, high-order tensors tend be sparse, a fact that hinders the application of multi-way analysis. To address this problem, we propose the application of kernel-based methods, which act as smoothing functions against sparsity. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Bibsonomy), indicates the superiority of the proposed method against the non kernel-based method and also against other baseline methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={With the increase of media-sharing web sites such as YouTube and Flickr, there are more and more shared multimedia resources on the Web. Multimedia search becomes more important and challenging, as users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, multimedia search needs to take users' personalized information into consideration. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social media. The user profiles obtained from collaborative tagging systems should be very useful for resource retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles from wider perspectives and apply them to personalized resource search in a collaborative tagging environment.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems (CTSs), also known as folksonomies, have grown in popularity on the Web and social tagging has become an important feature of many Web 2.0 services. It has been argued that the power of tagging lies in the ability for people to freely determine the appropriate tags for resources without having to rely on a predefined lexicon or hierarchy. The freeform nature of tagging causes a number of problems in this social classification scheme, such as synonymy and morphological variety. However, social tagging can be a valuable source of information to help in the organization of Web resources. In this paper we present an empirical analysis carried out to determine the importance of social tagging in Web page classification. Experimental results showed that tag-based classification outperformed classifiers based on full-text of documents. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging allows users to tag online resources. We refer to the large database of tags and their relationships as a tag space. In a tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests, and taxonomy is a useful way to organize these tags. As tags change over time, it is imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two key features. Firstly, we develop a novel context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. Secondly, we propose several algorithms for evolutionary taxonomy fusion. We conduct an extensive performance study using a very large real-life dataset (i.e., Del.ici.ous). The empirical results clearly show that our approach is effective and efficient. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The goal is to explore and exploit relational ties in a way to enable the mining of useful knowledge and effective information propagation/diffusion.

abstract={Collective Intelligence has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. With new technologies, such as blogs, twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, people may create and disseminate content as never before. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Additionally, many open-source initiatives have shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. We have been working in this domain for a few years now, mostly focusing on small disaster relief groups and field command. One of the command problems is lack of information about the location where the disaster occurred. We believe some of this information could be crowdsourced, changing current practices and enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for crowdsourcing and present an initial proposal for harnessing collective intelligence for the fire department. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, such as Delicious, CiteULike, and others, allow users to annotate resources, for example, Web pages or scientific papers, with descriptive labels called tags. The social annotations contributed by thousands of users can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify documents, or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference methods do not make the best use of social annotation, since they do not take into account variations in individual users' perspectives and vocabulary. In a previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes the interests of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming: the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics of Web resources from social annotations obtained from Delicious in order to discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social knowledge contained in user-generated annotations. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing popularity of Social Media sites, a lot of user generated content has been injected in the Web, thus resulting in a large amount of both multimedia items (music - Last.fm, MySpace.com, pictures - Flickr, Picasa, videos - YouTube) and textual data (tags and other text-based documents). As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods. © 2010 ACM.},

Since tagging has the potential to have an impact on task management in software development processes, there is a need to understand how developers use tagging in projects supported by collaborative development environments and how developers' behavior differ from collaborative tagging in the Social Web. We have conducted an independent replication of an empirical study, which first investigated how tags are used in a large software project. In our replication, we have analyzed two further projects coordinated through two different collaborative development environments, Jazz and Trac. The findings from our replicated study extend the initial contribution of the original study by (1) showing evidence of differences in tag usage between the two collaborative development environments, and (2) providing a clear understanding that tags used in such environments significantly differs from those used in traditional collaborative tagging systems. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

As Twitter evolves, more and more people are partaking in sharing what is happening around the world through various Twitter applications. Hashtag use has become a unique tagging convention to help associate Twitter messages with certain events or contexts. Prefixed by a # symbol with a keyword, a Twitter hashtag serves as a bottom-up user-proposed tagging convention. It also embodies user participation in the process of hashtag innovation, especially as it pertains to information organization tasks. Diffusion of innovation (DoI) is a theory that helps to explain the adoption process of an innovation by modeling its entire life cycle according to the aspects of communications and human information interactions. Hence, diffusion theory offers valuable insights into interface design that supports Twitter hashtag use and access. It also assists in evaluating hashtag life cycles and thus offering information required for decision-making, in regard to hashtag management.},

abstract={Tagging has rapidly become a popular way to annotate the content on social network sites. Tags describe the contents of the resource or provide additional contextual and semantical information to make the content more easily browsable and discoverable by others. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and a certain number of resources have no comments, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context. The results of the evaluation show that tag recommendation based on local lexicon is an effective way to improve collaborative resource sharing in social network.},

While some of the chosen URLs maintained or even increased their popularity, others experienced a severe drop in popularity. Tag usage showed some measures of influence between taggers, but users continued to use their own tags and the proportions of unique and untagged items has increased. Proportions of tags used showed fluctuations with islands of stability over a 4 year period. Patterns in the usage of tags assigned to these documents also highlighted practices related to personal and collective information organisation which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

abstract={Web 2.0 and social/collaborative tagging have altered the traditional roles of indexer and user. Traditional indexing tools and systems assume the top-down approach to indexing in which a trained professional is responsible for assigning index terms to information sources with a potential user in mind. However, in today's Web, end users create, organize, index, and search for images and other information sources through social tagging and other collaborative activities. One of the impediments to user-centered indexing had been the cost of soliciting user-generated index terms or tags. Social tagging of images such as those on Flickr, an online photo management and sharing application, presents an opportunity that can be seized by designers of indexing tools and systems to bridge the semantic gap between indexer terms and user vocabularies. Empirical research on the differences and similarities between user-generated tags and index terms based on controlled vocabularies has the potential to inform future design of image indexing tools and systems. Toward this end, a random sample of Flickr images and the tags assigned to them were content analyzed and compared with another sample of index terms from a general image collection using established frameworks for image attributes and contents. The results show that there is a fundamental difference between the types of tags and types of index terms used. In light of this, implications for research into and design of user-centered image indexing tools and systems are discussed. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

Several information management approaches, such as desktop search, document organization and (collaborative) document tagging have been proposed to address this, however they are either inappropriate or inefficient. Automated collaborative document tagging approaches mitigate the problems of manual tagging, but they are usually based on centralized settings which are plagued by problems such as scalability, privacy, etc. To resolve these issues, we present P2P DocTagger, an automated and distributed document tagging system based on classification in P2P networks. P2P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval. In addition, we provide a realistic and flexible simulation toolkit - P2PDMT, to facilitate the development and testing of P2P data mining algorithms. © 2010 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={We study personalized item recommendation within an enterprise social media application suite that includes blogs, bookmarks, communities, wikis, and shared files. Recommendations are based on two of the core elements of social media - people and tags. Relationship information among people, tags, and items, is collected and aggregated across different sources within the enterprise. Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging or collaborative tagging has become a new trend in the organization, management, and discovery of digital information. The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become a very popular way to share, annotate, and discover online resources in Web 2.0. Yet as the number of resources in Collaborative tagging system grows over time, sifting through the large amounts of resources and finding the right resources to recommend to the right user is becoming a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate a probabilistic generative model for collaborative tagging, explore the implicit semantic connections in the sparse and noisy information space of heterogeneous users and unsupervised tagging. First, a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to cluster the tags and users simultaneously. The generalization of resource description and user could alleviate the tag noise and data sparseness of recommendation effectively. And then, considering that topic-based recommendation only takes the users' global interest into consideration without the capability of distinguishing users' interest in detail, we combine the global interests with the individual interest and community interest. Experimental results demonstrate the topicbased personalized recommendation method, which integrate both the commonality factor among users and the specialties of individuals, could alleviate data sparsity and provide a more flexible and effective recommendation than previous methods.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

abstract={In collaborative filtering recommender systems, there is little room for users to get involved in the choice of their peer group. It leaves users defenseless against various spamming or "shilling" attacks. Other social Web-based systems, however, allow users to self-select peers and build a social network. We argue that users' self-defined social networks could be valuable to increase the quality of recommendation in CF systems. To prove the feasibility of this idea we examined how similar are interests of users connected by self-defined relationships in a collaborative tagging systems Citeulike. Interest similarity was measured by similarity of items and meta-data they share and tags they use. Our study shows that users connected by social networks exhibit significantly higher similarity on all explored levels (items, meta-data, and tags) than non-connected users. This similarity is the highest for directly connected users and decreases with the increase of distance between users. Among other interesting properties of information sharing is the finding that between-user similarity in social connections on the level of metadata and tags is much larger than similarity on the level of items. Overall, our findings support the feasibility of social network based recommender systems and offer some good hints to the prospective authors of these systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The vast amounts of video that need to be tagged preclude the exclusive use of professional indexers. Thus a significant amount of video will need to be tagged by non-experts. Are the tags created by experts demonstrably superior to those of non-experts, and when non-experts have to be used for tagging, is it better to rely on tags created by those who upload videos or on others who watch the videos? Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

abstract={Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Recent research provides evidence for the presence of emergent semantics in collaborative tagging systems. While several methods have been proposed, little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems. A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging: Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others. In this work, we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures. We distinguish between categorizers, who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes, and describers, who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords. To study our hypothesis, we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers. Our results not only show that "verbose" taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics, but also that a subset containing only 40% of the most 'verbose' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset. Moreover, the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics. This work is relevant for designers and analysts of tagging systems interested (i) in fostering the semantic development of their platforms, (ii) in identifying users introducing "semantic noise", and (iii) in learning ontologies. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract={Requirements engineering is essentially a social collaborative activity in which involved stakeholders have to closely work together to communicate, elicit, negotiate, define, confirm, and finally come up with the requirements for the system to be implemented or upgraded. In the development of large and complex systems, with a huge number of uncertain stakeholders, the requirements engineering process becomes a challenging task due to overwhelming and dynamic social interactions, tradeoffs, and collective decisions made by above stakeholders. Traditional approaches and techniques are deficient in supporting this kind of social interactions in requirements-related activities, and managing the evolving requirements and their traceability caused by the social interactions. This paper proposes to address the challenges in the pre-requirements analysis of large and complex systems by employing the techniques from collective intelligence based on Web 2.0 tools and technologies, which is composed of three steps: first, obtain collective requirements knowledge through collaborative tagging by stakeholders; second, transform collaborative requirement tags into requirement ontologies; third, support collective requirement decision-making (i.e., collective intelligence) based on the requirement ontologies through requirements reasoning. © 2010 ACM.},

Analyzing the data, one can observe that the visitor loyalty, their lengthy visits to the site and the pages they view are much higher for the site built on the principles of Web 2.0, compared to the classical sites. Likewise, we developed and implemented a collaborative tagging system that allows every registered user to publish, save and label the content with the help of tags. Therefore, this can help in building a model that not only offers customized content but also adapts the site to user needs by providing a recommendation system and aggregate collective intelligence. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube, del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success. State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

Two novel types of tags are proposed: "deep tags" that apply to a portion of the interaction and "instant tags" that apply to an instant of the interaction. Our system is being used by enterprise users and we analyze a corpus of 737 live-tags collected from 16 conversations that took place over several months.

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user-generated metadata. These annotations represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they are attached to, but it is not obvious which characteristics of the objects are predominantly described. The usefulness of these tags for finding/re-finding the annotated resources is also not completely clear. Several studies have started to investigate these issues, however only by focusing on a single type of tagging system or resource. We study this problem across multiple domains and resource types and identify the gaps between the tag space and the querying vocabulary. Based on the findings of this analysis, we then try to bridge the identified gaps, focusing in particular on multimedia resources. We focus on the two scenarios of music and picture resources and develop algorithms, which identify usage (theme) and opinion (mood) characteristics of the items. The mood and theme labels our algorithms infer are recommended to the users, in order to support them during the annotation process. The evaluation of the proposed methods against user judgements, as well as against expert ground truth reveal the high quality of our recommended annotations and provide insights into possible extensions for music and picture tagging systems to support retrieval. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social content systems contain enormous collections of unstructured user-generated content, annotated by the collaborative effort of regular Internet users. Tag-clouds have become popular interfaces that allow users to query the database of these systems by clicking relevant terms. However, these single click queries are often not expressive enough to effectively retrieve the desired content. Users have to use multiple clicks or type longer queries to satisfy their information need. To enhance the predicted content ranking we use a random walk model that effectively integrates the user's preference and semantically related query terms. We use the collaborative annotations from a popular on-line book catalog to create a social annotation graph and study the effect of personalization and smoothing for increasing query lengths. We show that personalization and smoothing allow the user to find equally relevant content with fewer query terms compared to a frequency based content ranking with TF-IDF weighing. As expected, we see that the influence of the random walk model disappears if users type more detailed queries. Finally, we discuss the observations with respect to synonyms and homographs which are well known to hamper the performance of information retrieval systems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular method in social resource sharing system. The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2 . Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. ©2010 IEEE.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a new knowledge propagation scheme to automatically propagate keywords from a subset of annotated images to the unannotated ones. The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation. Experimental results using 100 concept categories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The Games With A Purpose (GWAP) genre is a type of Human Computation that outsources certain steps of the computational process to humans. By taking advantage of people's desire to be entertained, GWAP attracts people to play voluntarily, and also produce useful metadata as a by-product. The games have shown promise in solving a variety of problems, which computer computation has been unable to resolve completely thus far. In this paper, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of GWAP systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of GWAP systems. We argue that it is important for GWAP systems to implement proper puzzle selection strategies in order to collect human intelligence in a more efficient manner. Therefore, based on our analysis, we implement an Optimal Puzzle Selection Strategy (OPSA) to improve GWAP systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed OPSA approach can effectively improve the system gain of GWAP systems, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large.

abstract={Collaborative tagging services (folksonomies) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era. They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications have attracted a considerable amount of attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.

abstract={Taxonomy is widely used in many of the website and directory navigation schemes for content/knowledge retrieval. However, information or content navigation support through taxonomy is often constrained due to its inability to take into account the full nomenclature and cultural nuances of knowledge seekers. The emergence and increasing adoption of collaborative tagging (social bookmarking) tools have provided lightweight and informal conceptual structures called folksonomies for knowledge retrieval. As for folksonomies, they reflect the vocabulary of the users. Hence, integrating folksonomies into a taxonomy combines the best of the two schemes as the resultant structure enhances taxonomy navigation with personsalisation for knowledge search and retrieval. This paper presents TaxoFolk, an algorithm for deriving hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy classification for enhanced knowledge navigation. The algorithm integrates folksonomy with a taxonomy through several unsupervised data mining techniques with augmented heuristics. © 2010 Operational Research Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications enable users to annotate online resources with user-generated keywords. The collection of these annotations and the way they connect users and resources produce a rich information space for users to explore. However the size, complexity and chaotic structure of these systems hamper users as they search for information. Recommenders can assist the user by suggesting resources, tags or even other users. Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions.

abstract={Thanks to the continuous growth of collaborative platforms like YouTube, Flickr and Delicious, we are recently witnessing to a rapid evolution of web dynamics towards a more 'social' vision, called Web 2.0. In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

abstract={The explosion of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing, such as social networks, or video and photo sharing sites, radically changed the Web dynamics and the way people use and organize information. The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages. Results of experiments carried out on a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy, show that the use of content-based techniques improves the predictive accuracy of the tag recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social media systems have encouraged end user participation in the Internet, for the purpose of storing and distributing Internet content, sharing opinions and maintaining relationships. Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Nowadays, web collaborative tagging systems which allow users to upload, comment on and recommend contents, are growing. Such systems can be represented as graphs where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the problem of computing a ranking of users with respect to a facet described as a set of tags. A straightforward solution is to compute a PageRank-like algorithm on a facet-related graph, but it is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on the graph analysis of YouTube and Flickr, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results with two gold standards. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as a primary means for storing and sharing data among friends, family, colleagues, or perfect strangers as long as they have common interests. del.icio.us3 is a social network where people store and share their personal bookmarks. Most importantly, users tag their bookmarks for ease of information dissemination and later look up. However, it is the friendship links, that make del.icio.us a social network. They exist independently of the set of bookmarks that belong to the users and have no relation to the tags typically assigned to the bookmarks. To study the interaction among users, the strength of the existing links and their hidden meaning, we introduce implicit links in the network. These links connect only highly "similar " users. Here, similarity can reeflect different aspects of the user's profile that makes her similar to any other user, such as number of shared bookmarks, or similarity of their tags clouds. The authors investigate the question whether friends have common interests, they gain additional insights on the strategies that users use to assign tags to their bookmarks, and they demonstrate that the graphs formed by implicit links have unique properties differing from binomial random graphs or random graphs with an expected power-law degree distribution. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general framework that incorporates collaborative social tagging with a novel ontology scheme conveying multiple perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a framework where multiple users tag the same object (an image in this case) and an ontology is extended based on these tags while being tolerant of different points of view. Both the tagging and the ontological models are intentionally designed to suit the multi-perspective environment. The paper develops a method based on a set of rules that determine how to associate new concepts to predefined perspectives (in addition to determining relations to topics or other concepts as typically done in previous research) and how to insert and maintain multiple perspectives. Findings - This case study experiment, with a set of selected annotated images, indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model. Originality/value - The proposed framework characterises the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development of a multi-perspective ontology and its application to improve image annotation, searching and browsing. The significance of this research is that it focuses on exploring the impact of creating a constantly evolving ontology based on collaborative tagging. The paper is not aware of any other work that has attempted to devise such an environment and to study its dynamics. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Taxonomy construction is a resource-demanding, top-down, and time consuming effort. It does not always cater for the prevailing context of the captured information. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically convert tags into a hierarchical taxonomy. Folksonomy describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords or tags to shared content. Using folksonomy as a knowledge source for nominating tags, the proposed method first converts the tags into a hierarchy. This serves to harness a core set of taxonomy terms; the generated hierarchical structure facilitates users' information navigation behavior and permits personalizations. Newly acquired tags are then progressively integrated into a taxonomy in a largely automated way to complete the taxonomy creation process. Common taxonomy construction techniques are based on 3 main approaches: clustering, lexico-syntactic pattern matching, and automatic acquisition from machine-readable dictionaries. In contrast to these prevailing approaches, this paper proposes a taxonomy construction analysis based on heuristic rules and deep syntactic analysis. The proposed method requires only a relatively small corpus to create a preliminary taxonomy. The approach has been evaluated using an expert-defined taxonomy in the environmental protection domain and encouraging results were yielded. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={All computer software systems, whether online or offline, require a help system. Help texts are traditionally written by software development companies and answer targeted questions in the form of how-tos and troubleshooting procedures. However, when the popularity of an application grows, users of the application themselves start adding to the corpus of help for the system in the form of online tutorials. There is, however, one problem with such tutorials. They have no direct link with the software for which they are written. Users have to search the Internet for different tutorials that are usually hosted on dispersed locations, and there is no ideal way of finding the relevant information without ending up with lots of noise in the search results. In this chapter, we describe a model for a help system which enhances this concept using collaborative tagging for categorization of “helplets.” For the knowledge retrieval part of the system, we utilize a previously developed technique based on common sense and user personalization. We use a freely available common sense reasoning toolkit for knowledge retrieval. Our architecture can be implemented in Web-based systems as well as in stand-alone desktop applications. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems have taken off at an unexpected scale and speed (Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, Last.fm, Delicious, etc). Web content is now generated by you, me, our friends and millions of others. This represents a revolution in usage and a great opportunity to leverage collaborative knowledge to enhance the user's Internet experience. The Gossple project aims at precisely achieving this: automatically capturing affinities between users that are potentially unknown yet share similar interests, or exhibiting similar behaviors on the Web. This can fully personalizes the Web 2.0 experience process, increasing the ability of a user to find relevant content, get relevant recommandation, etc. This personalization calls for decentralization. (1) Centralized servers might dissuade users from generating new content for they expose their privacy and represent a single point of attack. (2) The amount of information to store grows exponentially with the size of the system and centralized systems cannot sustain storing a growing amount of data at a user granularity. We believe that the salvation can only come from a fully decentralized user centric approach where every participant is entrusted to harvest the Web with information relevant to her own activity. This poses a number of scientific challenges: How to discover similar users, how to build and manage a network of similar users, how to define the relevant metrics for such personalization, how to preserve privacy when needed, how to deal with free-riders and misheavior and how to manage efficiently a growing amount of data. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={With a suitable algorithm for ranking the expertise of a user in a collaborative tagging system, we will be able to identify experts and discover useful and relevant resources through them. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. Firstly, an expert should possess a high quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it. Secondly, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users do. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (SPamming-resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking), which implements these ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. We evaluate our method with experiments on data sets collected from Delicious.com comprising over 71,000 Web documents, 0.5 million users and 2 million shared bookmarks. We also show that the algorithm is more resistant to spammers than other methods such as the original HITS algorithm and simple statistical measures. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications have become a popular tool allowing Internet users to manage online resources with tags. Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.

abstract={The challenge to provide tag recommendations for collaborative tagging systems has attracted quite some attention of researchers lately. However, most research focused on the evaluation and development of appropriate methods rather than tackling the practical challenges of how to integrate recommendation methods into real tagging systems, record and evaluate their performance. In this paper we describe the tag recommendation framework we developed for our social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. With the intention to develop, test, and evaluate recommendation algorithms and supporting cooperation with researchers, we designed the framework to be easily extensible, open for a variety of methods, and usable independent from BibSonomy. Furthermore, this paper presents a first evaluation of two exemplarily deployed recommendation methods. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Due to the large quantities of available media content, effective organization to support fast browsing and retrieval is important to multimedia database applications including e-Learning. Traditional subject indexing approach of information organization only allows users to access data via controlled vocabularies generated by experts. For media items with rich and complex semantics, it is not suitable to classify them into predefined categories. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative tagging based approach for multimedia content organization, based on which users can derive personalized views of media items, as well as execute personalized search by specifying customized semantic feature vectors. To illustrate the potential of our approach, some case studies are conducted upon an underlying recipe database for an online cooking learning system. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={The proliferation of social web technologies such as collaborative tagging has led to an increasing awareness of their vulnerability to misuse. Attackers may attempt to distort the system's adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. Prior work on recommender systems has shown that studying different attack types, their properties and their impact, can help identify robust algorithms that make these systems more secure and less vulnerable to manipulation. Unlike traditional recommender systems, a tagging system includes multiple retrieval algorithms to facilitate browsing of resources, users and tags. The challenge is, therefore, evaluating the impact of various types of attacks across different navigation options. In this paper we develop a framework for characterizing attacks against tagging systems. We then propose a methodology for evaluating their global impact based on PageRank. Using real data from a popular tagging systems, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of several attack types. Our results help us understand how much effort is needed from an attacker to change the behavior of a tagging system and which attack types are more successful against such systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © 2009 IEEE.},

The nature of VLSC allows the accumulation of thousands of conversation in a fraction of time, and it often grows out of users' readable capacity. Therefore, extracting dominant public opinion on VLSC is usually impossible without causing an information overload. In this paper, Qtag is proposed to improve the VLSC environment by extracting public opinion easily, enhancing the value of conversation, and increasing the participants' willingness to engage. A simulation which mimics reality is built to create a VLSC environment, and two sets of questionnaire are conducted to compare users' experiences before and after Qtag trial. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems have taken off at an unexpected scale and speed (Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, Last.fm, Delicious, etc). Web content is now generated by you, me, our friends and millions of others. This represents a revolution in usage and a great opportunity to leverage collaborative knowledge to enhance the user's Internet experience. The Gossple project aims at precisely achieving this: automatically capturing affinities between users that are potentially unknown yet share similar interests, or exhibiting similar behaviors on the Web. This fully personalizes the search process, increasing the ability of a user to find relevant content. This personalization calls for decentralization. (1) Centralized servers might dissuade users from generating new content for they expose their privacy and represent a single point of attack. (2) The amount of information to store grows exponentially with the size of the system and centralized systems cannot sustain storing a growing amount of data at a user granularity. We believe that the salvation can only come from a fully decentralized user centric approach where every participant is entrusted to harvest the Web with information relevant to her own activity. This poses a number of scientific challenges: How to discover similar users, how to define the relevant metrics for such personalization, how to preserve privacy when needed, how to deal with free-riders and misheavior and how to manage efficiently a growing amount of data. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents. We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks. This study suggests that by studying the collective behaviour of users we are able to enhance navigation and organisation of Web documents. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are social data repositories, in which users manage resources using descriptive keywords (tags). An important element of collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes a set of tags to each newly posted resource. In this paper we discuss the potential role of three tag sources: resource content as well as resource and user profiles in the tag recommendation system. Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for "content-based" and "graph-based" recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively.},

abstract={The number of published Web services has known a considerable growth these recent years making the task of finding the ones relevant to a requirement more and more complicated. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only in the internal characteristics related to Web service description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment. The success of Del.icio.us1, Flickr2, CiteULike3 and Connotea4 convinces us that collaborative tagging system is not only helpful in sharing and classifying Web resources but also can enhance the Web service discovery process. Without affecting actual Web 2.0 users' habit, we illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery (CoTE-WeD) allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. The system implementing our environment proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keyword-based and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed using WordNet 5 in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords.},

abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, like a web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model.We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuous growth of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing made possible the passage from an 'elitary' Web, written by few and read by many, towards the so-called Web 2.0, a more 'user-centric' vision, where users become active contributors in Web dynamics. In this context, collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging: in these platforms users can annotate resources they like with freely chosen keyword (called tags) in order to make retrieval of information and serendipitous browsing more and more easier. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems (called tag recommenders) is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated by exploiting different approaches. In this paper we present a tag recommender developed for the ECML-PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge. Our approach is based on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources.},

abstract={Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

abstract={Tagging is a process whereby users freely choose keywords to label web objects in order to share or recover them later. Tags associated to an object by the user depict his viewpoint or perception. The perception of the target user can be enhanced by aggregating and analyzing the tags associated to an object by other users who share at least one tag with the target user in common for that object and recommending tags to him. Most of the existing techniques recommend tags on the basis of their popularity among the users. The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes. To observe the performance of our approach, experiments are carried out on the data collected from del.icio.us, a social book marking site that allows the users to tag URLs and share them with other people. © 2009 IEEE.},

The current study aims to study how the intra-personal consistency of tagging can be improved by proper tag visualization. The effects of visualization of tag frequency and visualization of the relevancy among tags on personal tagging consistency are empirically tested and compared through an experiment with 39 participants. The results show that visualization of tag relevancy improves tagging consistency significantly and reduces mental workload simultaneously; visualization of tag frequency may alleviate perceived physical demand when tag relevancy is visualized.

abstract={Performance of recommender systems depends on whether the user profiles contain accurate information about the interests of the users, and this in turn relies on whether enough information about their interests can be collected. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to use their own words to describe their favourite resources, resulting in some user-generated categorisation schemes commonly known as folksonomies. Folksonomies thus contain rich information about the interests of the users, which can be used to support various recommender systems. Our analysis of the folksonomy in Delicious reveals that the interests of a single user can be very diverse. Traditional methods for representing interests of users are usually not able to reflect such diversity. We propose a method to construct user profiles of multiple interests from folksonomies based on a network clustering technique. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is able to generate user profiles which reflect the diversity of user interests and can be used as a basis of providing more focused recommendation to the users. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative Tagging is a powerful method to create folksonomies that can be used to grasp/filter user preferences or enhance web search. Recent research has shown that depending on the number of users and the quality of user-provided tags powerful community-driven semantics or "ontologies" can emerge - as it was evident analyzing user data from social web applications such as del.icio.us or Flickr. Unfortunately, most web pages do not contain tags and, thus, no vocabulary that describes the information provided. A common problem in web page annotation is to motivate users for constant participation, i.e. tagging. In this paper we describe our approach of a binary verification game that embeds collaborative tagging into on-line games in order to produce domain specific folksonomies.

On our first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF), we use Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. Our second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering (NwCF), incorporates the amount of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. A modified version of the Okapi BM25 IR model over users' tags is implemented on our third approach to form the user neighborhood. Our results suggest that incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, and they also support that tags can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors in a collaborative tagging system.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow users to annotate online resources. The result is a complex tapestry of interrelated users, resources and tags often called a folksonomy. Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

abstract={Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={The amount of text data on the Internet is growing at a very fast rate. Online text repositories for news agencies, digital libraries and other organizations currently store giga- and tera-bytes of data. Large amounts of unstructured text poses a serious challenge for data mining and knowledge extraction. End user participation coupled with distributed computation can play a crucial role in meeting these challenges. In many applications involving classification of text documents, web users often participate in the tagging process. This collaborative tagging results in the formation of large scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems which can function, scale and self-organize in the presence of highly transient population of nodes and do not need a central server for co-ordination. In this paper, we describe TagLearner, a P2P classifier learning system for extracting patterns from text data where the end users can participate both in the task of labeling the data and building a distributed classifier on it. We present a novel distributed linear programming based classification algorithm which is asynchronous in nature.

abstract={In recent years, tagging systems have been paid increasing attentions from both research communities and system designers. Most popular online social networking sites harness tag for managing and locating contents, for organizing and connecting users, and for recommending and sharing resources. We believe that tag acts like bridge between people and resources. Research on tag and tagging behavior will provide us insight about resource space and user activities on the Internet. In this paper, we present a two-level analysis of the tagging system of Del.icio.us. The results from both two levels confirm each other. In network level, we connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a social network of tags. By investigating its network feature, we find phenomena of small world and scale-free network. We also discover that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness. In individual level, users' tagging behaviors and patterns are observed by visualizing their bookmarking history on Del.icio.us. Besides, we study the linked users by their tags and find that users within a subscription network share more common interests than random pairs of users. During the analysis, we also discuss the implications of the findings for the design of tag-based system. © 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Music theme annotations would be really beneficial for supporting retrieval, but are often neglected by users while annotating. Thus, in order to support users in tagging and to fill the gaps in the tag space, in this paper we develop algorithms for recommending theme annotations. Our methods exploit already existing user tags, the lyrics of music tracks, as well as combinations of both. We compare the results for our recommended theme annotations against genre and style recommendations - a much easier and already studied task. We evaluate the quality of our recommended tags against an expert ground truth data set. Our results are promising and provide interesting insights into possible extensions for music tagging systems to support music search. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

CiteULike is a so-called folksonomy where users have the possibility to organize publications through annotations - tags. Making reliable recommendations during the initial phase of a folksonomy is a difficult task, since information about user preferences is meager. In order to improve recommendation results during this cold start period, we present a probabilistic approach to item recommendation. Our model extends previously proposed models such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) by merging both user-item as well as item-tag observations into a unified representation. We find that bringing tags into play reduces the risk of overfitting and increases overall recommendation quality. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other types of recommenders.

abstract={Social tagging systems present a new challenge to the researchers working on recommender systems. The presence of tags, which uncover the reasons of user interests to tagged items, opens a way to increase the quality of recommendations. Yet, there is no common agreement of how the power of tags can be harnessed for recommendation. In this paper we argue for the use of spreading activation approach for building tag-aware recommender systems and suggest a specific version of this approach adapted to the multidimensional nature of social tagging networks. We introduce the asymmetric measure of relevancy (proximity) of two nodes on a multidimensional network as a cumulative strength of (weighted) multiple connections between two nodes, which includes paths and graph-structures connecting the nodes. This metric is also applicable to measure relevancy of two sub-graphs. Spreading activation methods (SAM), which usually employ breadth first search, are an efficient way to define and compute such measure taking into account not only links constituent a path, but the properties of nodes in the path such as node's types and outdegree. We apply this notion of relevancy to measure similarity of collaborative tagging systems users and present the results of numerical simulation showing that spreading activation methods allow us to discriminate between diverse graph-structures connecting users via resources and tags. We show that the results of simulation are stable w.r.t. the variation of parameters of spreading activation algorithm used in our experiment.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr have achieved great success. This chapter is concerned with the problem of social tagging analysis and mining. More specifically, we discuss five properties of social tagging and their applications: 1) keyword property, which means social annotations serve as human selected keywords for Web resources; 2) semantic property, which indicates semantic relations among tags and Web resources; 3) hierarchical property, which means that hierarchical structure can be derived from the flat social tagging space; 4) quality property, which means that Web resources' qualities are varied and can be quantified using social tagging; 5) distribution property, which indicates the distribution of frequencies of social tags usually converges to a power-law distribution. These properties are the most principle characteristics, which have been popularly discussed and explored in many applications. As a case study, we show how to improve the social resource browsing by applying the five properties of social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={The discipline of finding and recommending new and similar multimedia content has gained a growing importance in multimedia information retrieval over the last years. The two classical approaches, namely Content-based filtering (CB) and Collaborative filtering (CF), can be used in conjunction with each other to get benefit from both content analysis and user feedback. This paper introduces a system, called GlobalMusic2one that implements a novel approach to hybrid music search by combining methods of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Web 2.0 techniques to reach a new quality in recommending and distributing global music collections. To be able to classify these collections and to determine relationships between them, textual descriptions are gathered by collaborative tagging and statistical Web document analysis, as relevant documents in the Web may contain a lot of freely accessible and descriptive information on music content. The resulting text corpus can be used to identify connected entities, e.g. which artist is connected or similar to another artist. Therefore, this approach sensibly complements CB and CF techniques and has already been successfully implemented in the interactive music search system NIMS, which will be introduced as well.},

abstract={Social networking and tagging have taken off at an unexpected scale and speed, opening huge opportunities to enhance the user search experience. We present Gossple 1, a new, user-centric, approach to improve the exploration of the Internet. Underlying Gossple lies the intuition that while social networks provides news from your old buddies, you can learn a lot more from people you don't know, but with whom you share many (tagging) interests. More specifically, considering a collaborative tagging system with active taggers annotating content, Gossple expands the search query, of any user u, with tags that are considered "close" enough with respect to users that are "close" to u. Gossple users create their own network of social acquaintances in a gossip-based manner, by dynamically computing the estimation of a distance between taggers, based on cosine similarity between tags and items. These connections are used to feed a TagMap: our central abstraction that captures the personalised relationships between tags. The TagMap is then used by Gossple to meaningfully expand queries leveraging the personalised network. This is achieved through the TagRank algorithm, an adaptation of the celebrated pagerank algorithm, which automatically determines which tags best expand a list of tags in a given query. Gossple has no central authority: every user stores its own items and its tagging behaviour is stored only by its neighbours. The resulting networks are live, dynamic and do not require any underlying structure. We report on our evaluation of Gossple with CiteUlike traces, involving 33, 834 users. In short, we show that, with little information stored at every peer, Gossple enables to retrieve items that cannot be retrieved with state of the art search systems (complete- ness).Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Nowadays, the most dominant and noteworthy web information sources are developed according to the collaborative-web paradigm, also known as Web 2.0. In particular, it represents a novel paradigm in the way users interact with the web. Users (also called prosumers) are no longer passive consumers of published content, but become involved, implicitly and explicitly, as they cooperate by providing their own resources in an "architecture of participation". In this scenario, collaborative tagging, i.e., the process of classifying shared resources by using keywords, becomes more and more popular. The main problem in such task is related to well-known linguistic phenomena, such as polysemy and synonymy, making effective content retrieval harder. In this paper, an approach that monitors users activity in a tagging system and dynamically quantifies associations among tags is presented. The associations are then used to create tags clusters. Experiments are performed comparing the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art tag clustering technique. Results -given in terms of classical precision and recall- show that the approach is quite effective in the presence of strongly related tags in a cluster. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications such as delicious, flickr or lastfm have recently become extremely popular and as a result, a large amount of semantically rich metadata produced by users becomes available and exploitable. Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

abstract={What makes a song to a chart hit? Many people are trying to find the answer to this question. Previous attempts to identify hit songs have mostly focused on the intrinsic characteristics of the songs, such as lyrics and audio features. As social networks become more and more popular and some specialize on certain topics, information about users' music tastes becomes available and easy to exploit. In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

abstract={Email is no longer perceived as a communication marvel, but rather as a constant source of information overload. Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

abstract={As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, music genre classification has attracted considerable research attention. Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

abstract={Recommendations in collaborative tagging sites such as del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies, are becoming increasingly important, due to the proliferation of general queries on those sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address those queries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy, item-based or user-based, one of the key concerns in producing recommendations, is over-specialization, which results in returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processing returned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (e.g., genre and actors for movies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are not available (e.g., URLs in del.icio.us). In a recent paper [20], we introduced the notion of explanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise between accuracy and diversity. In this paper, we develop efficient diversification algorithms built upon this notion. The algorithms explore compromises between accuracy and diversity. We demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in diversification on two real life data sets: del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the rapidly growing web 2.0 applications. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. This drawback has created the need for ontological structures which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations for translating and integrating the different sources. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for extracting ontological structure from folksonomies that exploits the power of low support association rule mining supplemented by an upper ontology such as WordNet. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article uses data from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to empirically examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems and to study how coherent categorization schemes emerge from unsupervised tagging by individual users. First, we study the formation of stable distributions in tagging systems, seen as an implicit form of “consensus” reached by the users of the system around the tags that best describe a resource. We show that final tag frequencies for most resources converge to power law distributions and we propose an empirical method to examine the dynamics of the convergence process, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The convergence analysis is performed for both the most utilized tags at the top of tag distributions and the so-called long tail. Second, we study the information structures that emerge from collaborative tagging, namely tag correlation (or folksonomy) graphs.We show how community-based network techniques can be used to extract simple tag vocabularies from the tag correlation graphs by partitioning them into subsets of related tags. Furthermore, we also show, for a specialized domain, that shared vocabularies produced by collaborative tagging are richer than the vocabularies which can be extracted from large-scale query logs provided by a major search engine. © 2009, ACM.

abstract={Most of the existing personal knowledge management systems have been employing blogging services which is capable of providing various services (e.g., knowledge distribution and knowledge creation) to people. However, automated knowledge delivering service among the systems is difficult to take into account the corresponding context (or semantics) of the knowledge, so that the service can spread irrelevant information into knowledge management systems. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a novel architecture, called blog context overlay network, to fulfill context matching between blog-based knowledge management systems. It is referred to as detecting 'shared' context between knowledge management systems. Thus, with respect to the contexts, we want to identify a community of practice (CoP) on a knowledge blogosphere where a set of blog-based knowledge management systems are incorporating with each other. As a result, newly generated knowledge can be proactively diffused to the blog-based knowledge management systems of which context is relevant to the knowledge, even before the bloggers' queries are explicitly asked. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Multimedia content is uploaded, tagged and recommended by users of collaborative systems such as YouTube and Flickr. These systems can be represented as tagged-graphs, where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the online computation of user-rankings associated to a set of tags, called a facet. A simple approach to faceted ranking is to apply an algorithm that calculates a measure of node centrality, say, PageRank, to a subgraph associated with the given facet. This solution, however, is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative solution: (i) first, a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) then, a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on empirical observations, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results to those produced by the direct calculation .},

abstract={The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier.

abstract={In today's information environments, tagging is widely used to provide information about arbitrary types of digital resources. This information is usually created by end users with different motivations and for different kinds of purposes. When aiming to support users in the tagging process, these differences play an important role. In this paper several approaches to generate tag recommendations are discussed, and a prototypical recommender system for the social resource sharing platform ALOE is presented. This interactive system allows users to control the generation of the recommendations by selecting the sources to be used as well as their impact. The component was introduced at DFKI, and a first evaluation showed that the recommender component was considered as helpful by a majority of users. © J.UCS.},

abstract={Consumer Generated Media(CGM) is growing rapidly and the amount of content is increasing. However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We propose the utilization of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicates that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Research on how to improve item recommendation quality leveraging tags is emerging yet information hidden in tags is far from being fully exploited. In this paper, we aim at finding informative usage patterns from tags by consistent clustering on tags using nonnegative matrix factorization. The clustered subjects, represented by weighed tag vectors, can then be used to build a subjectcentered user information seeking model for item recommendation. Experiments on two realworld datasets show that our subject-based algorithms substantially outperform the traditional CF methods as well as tag-enhanced recommendation approaches reported in the literature.},

abstract={This paper presents an in-depth study of the social tagging mechanisms used in Freesound.org, an online community where users share and browse audio files by means of tags and content-based audio similarity search. We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

abstract={More and more information is available on the Web, and the current search engines do a great job to make it accessible. Yet, optimizing for a large number of users, they usually provide good answers only to "most of us", and have yet to provide satisfying mechanisms to search for audiovisual content. In this talk I will present some ongoing work at L3S addressing these challenges, done in the context of several European Union funded projects on personal information management and web search. Regarding personalization, I will talk about personalizing Web Search based on user content, which goes beyond simple user profiles used in other systems. The algorithms presented improve Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user's personal information repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. Generating the additional query keywords is done by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Extensive empirical analysis shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Regarding search for audiovisual content, I will focus on exploiting user generated information, and discuss what kinds of tags are used for different resources and how they can help for search. Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. I will present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for different kinds of resources - Web pages, music, and images. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

We motivate the preferred usage of feeds compared to full site grabbing, and present analysis results of feed data from the same period of one month concerning feature distribution, growth, stability and convergence aspects. Furthermore we compare tag spaces and their intersections for potential interoperability and integration of these services, and reveal that tags in practice are not really as freely chosen as often promised. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linking of a folksonomy (user vocabulary) and LCSH (controlled vocabulary) on the basis of word matching, for the potential use of LCSH in bringing order to folksonomies. Design/methodology/approach A selected sample of a folksonomy from a popular collaborative tagging system, Delicious, was wordmatched with LCSH. LCSH was transformed into a tree structure called an LCSH tree for the matching. A close examination was conducted on the characteristics of folksonomies, the overlap of folksonomies with LCSH, and the distribution of folksonomies over the LCSH tree. Findings The experimental results showed that the total proportion of tags being matched with LC subject headings constituted approximately twothirds of all tags involved, with an additional 10 percent of the remaining tags having potential matches. A number of barriers for the linking as well as two areas in need of improving the matching are identified and described. Three important tag distribution patterns over the LCSH tree were identified and supported: skewedness, multifacet, and Zipfianpattern. Research limitations/implications The results of the study can be adopted for the development of innovative methods of mapping between folksonomy and LCSH, which directly contributes to effective access and retrieval of tagged web resources and to the integration of multiple information repositories based on the two vocabularies. Practical implications The linking of controlled vocabularies can be applicable to enhance information retrieval capability within collaborative tagging systems as well as across various tagging system information depositories and bibliographic databases. Originality/value This is among frontier works that examines the potential of linking a folksonomy, extracted from a collaborative tagging system, to an authoritymaintained subject heading system. It provides exploratory data to support further advanced mapping methods for linking the two vocabularies. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, supported by many social networking websites, is currently enjoying an increasing popularity. The usefulness of this largely available tag data has been explored in many applications including web resources categorization,deriving emergent semantics, web search etc. However, since tags are supplied by users freely, not all of them are useful and reliable, especially when they are generated by spammers with malicious intent. Therefore, identifying tags of high quality is crucial in improving the performance of applications based on tags. In this paper, we propose TRP-Rank (Tag-Resource Pair Rank), an algorithm to measure the quality of tags by manually assessing a seed set and propagating the quality through a graph. The three dimensional relationship among users, tags and web resources is firstly represented by a graph structure. A set of seed nodes, where each node represents a tag annotating a resource, is then selected and their quality is assessed. The quality of the remaining nodes is calculated by propagating the known quality of the seeds through the graph structure. We evaluate our approach on a public data set where tags generated by suspicious spammers were manually labelled. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in measuring the quality of tags. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recently, many Web services such as social networking services, blogs, and collaborative tagging have become widely popular. Many attempts are being made to investigate user interactions by analyzing social networks among users. However, analyzing a social network with attributional data is often not an easy task because numerous ways exist to define features through aggregation of different tables. In this study, we propose an algorithm to identify important network-based features systematically from a given social network to analyze user behavior efficiently and to expand the services. We apply our method for link-based classification and link prediction tasks with two different datasets, i.e., an @cosme (an online viral marketing site) dataset and a Hatena Bookmark (collaborative tagging service) dataset, to demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm. Our algorithm is general and can provide useful network-based features for social network analyses. Copyright © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Considering the natural tendency of people to follow direct or indirect cues of other people's activities, collaborative filtering-based recommender systems often predict the utility of an item for a particular user according to previous ratings by other similar users. Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have nowadays become important data sources for populating semantic web applications. For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social bookmarking is the process through which users share tags for online resources like blogs with others. Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

abstract={This research paper reports part of a larger international study that employs collaborative tagging for effectively describing knowledge and learning resources (KLR) in an institutionalised setting. The number of these resources has increased enormously within organisations over time and with an increasing variety of quality standards, maturity and granularity of resources, the description of content with metadata becomes more and more challenging. Automatic extraction services and professional metadata authoring tools could not deliver the expected results. Therefore, this research project investigated and discussed collaborative tagging as a means to successfully tag KLR. This paper presents results of an online survey distributed to first-year Information Systems students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The results report on the study's key themes of commitment and convergence towards generally accepted collaborative tags. Commitment and convergence could be confirmed, but there is a need for further exploration with a higher number of participants. Collaborative tagging is suggested as a solution to facilitate the development of ontologies for describing organisational metadata. © 2008 Ronald Maier, Silke Retzer and Stefan Thalmann.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

In our paper, we have proposed a collective collaborative tagging (CCT) service architecture in which both service providers and individual users can merge folksonomy data (in the form of keyword tags) stored in different sources to build a larger, unified repository. We have also examined a range of algorithms that can be applied to different problems in folksonomy analysis and information discovery. These algorithms address several common problems for online systems: searching, getting recommendations, finding communities of similar users, and finding interesting new information by trends. Our contributions are to a) systematically examine the available public algorithms' application to tag-based folksonomies, and b) to propose a service architecture that can provide these algorithms as online capabilities.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity to explore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of a network of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers. Our results are supported by extensive experiments on del.icio.us datasets. © 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={Rapid growth of published Web services makes their discoveries more and more difficult. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keywordbased and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords. © 2008 IEEE.},

We also put forward the necessary data standards to interoperate at both data format and semantic levels. We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms.

abstract={Whereas the number of services that are provided online is growing rapidly, current service discovery approaches seem to have problems fulfilling their objectives. Existing approaches are hampered by the complexity of underlying semantic service models and by the fact that they try to impose a technical vocabulary to users. This leads to what we call the service discovery gap. In this paper we envision an approach that allows users to query or browse services using free text tags, thus providing an interface in terms of the users' vocabulary instead of the service's vocabulary. Unlike simple keyword search, we envision tag clouds associated with services themselves as semantic descriptions carrying collaborative knowledge about the service that can be clustered hierarchically, forming lightweight "ontologies". Besides tag-based discovery only describing the service on a global view, we envision refined tags and refined search/discovery in terms of the concepts that are common to all current semantic service description models, i.e. input, output, and operation. We argue that Service matching can be achieved, by applying tag-cloud-based service similarity on the one hand and by clustering services using case based indexing and retrieval techniques on the other hand.},

abstract={There is a growing interest into how we represent and share tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. Conventional tags, meaning freely created tags that are not associated with a structured ontology, are not naturally suited for collaborative processes, due to linguistic and grammatical variations, as well as human typing errors. Additionally, tags reflect personal views of the world by individual users, and are not normalised for synonymy, morphology or any other mapping. Our view is that the conventional approach provides very limited semantic value for collaboration. Moreover, in cases where there is some semantic value, automatically sharing semantics via computer manipulations is extremely problematic. This paper explores these problems by discussing approaches for collaborative tagging activities at a semantic level, and presenting conceptual models for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies. We present criteria for the comparison of existing tag ontologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in relation to these criteria.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have emerged in recent years to become popular tools for organising information on the Web. While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system. In this paper we describe our proposal and some results of our preliminary experiments. We also discuss the significance of the work and how it can be evaluated. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The organization of the knowledge on the web is increasingly becoming a social task performed by online communities whose members share a common interest in classifying different types of information for a later retrieval. Collaborative tagging systems allow people to organize a set of resources of interest through unconstrained annotations based on free keywords commonly named tags. Suggestive tagging techniques support users in this organization process and have shown to be helpful also in fostering a quick convergence to a shared tag vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a tag recommender which relies on the content analysis of the resource to be tagged, as well as on the personal and collective tagging history. The main contribution of this work is a model which combines semantic content analysis methods with existing suggestive tagging techniques. The expected benefit is the improvement of the user experience in social bookmarking systems, and more generally in collaborative tagging systems.},

abstract={Consumer Generated Media (CGM) is growing rapidly and the amount of content is increasing. However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We proposed the use of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicated that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

In this paper, we present our analysis on the personal data in folksonomies, and investigate how accurate user profiles can be generated from this data. We reveal that the majority of users possess multiple interests, and propose an algorithm to generate user profiles which can accurately represent these multiple interests.

Being the scenario similar to traditional recommender systems where nearest neighbor algorithms, better known as collaborative filtering, were extensively and successfully applied, the application of the same methods to the problem of tag recommendation seems to be a natural way to follow. However, it is necessary to take into consideration some particularities of these systems, such as the absence of ratings and the fact that two entity types in a rating scale correspond to three top level entity types, i.e., user, resources and tags. In this paper we cast the tag recommendation problem into a collaborative filtering perspective and starting from a view on the plain recommendation task without attributes, we make a ground evaluation comparing different tag recommender algorithms on real data.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizingWeb resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. This paper is the first to present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for very different kinds of resources and systems - Web pages (Del.icio.us), music (Last.fm), and images (Flickr) - and compares the results with anchor text characteristics. We analyze and classify sample tags from these systems, to get an insight into what kinds of tags are used for different resources, and provide statistics on tag distributions in all three tagging environments. Since even relevant tags may not add new information to the search procedure, we also check overlap of tags with content, with metadata assigned by experts and from other sources. We discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search, comparing them with user queries posted to search engines as well as through a user survey. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags.

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy).

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of the correlation of annotated information unit (textual) tags and geographical identification metadata geotags. Despite the increased usage of geotagging in collaborative tagging systems, most current research focuses on textual tagging alone in solving the tag search problem. This may result in difficulties to search for precise and relevant information within the given tag space. For example, inconsistencies like polysemy, synonyms, and word inflections with plural forms complicate the tag search problem. Therefore, more work needs to be done to include geotag information with existing tagging information for analysis. In this paper, to make geotagging possible to be used in analysis with tagging, we prove that there is a strong correlation between tagging and geotagging information. Our approach uses tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity to determine inter-relationships among tags and geotags. From our initial experiments, we show that the power law is established between tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity: this means that tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity has a strong correlation and the correlation can be used to find more relevant tags in the tag space. The power law confirms that there is an increased relationship between tagging and geotagging and the increased relationship is scalable in size of tags and geotags. Also, using both geotagging and tagging information instead of only tagging, we show that the uncertainty between derived and actual similarities among tags is reduced. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Information on Web2.0, generated by users of web based services, is both difficult to organize and organic in nature. Content categorization and search in such situation offers challenging scenarios. The primary means of content categorization in such social services is folk-sonomy or collaborative tagging. During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model.

A possible way to face or at least reduce these problems is represented by the introduction of semantics to characterize the contents of Web resources: each resource is described by one or more concepts instead of simple and often ambiguous keywords. To support these task the availability of a global semantic resource of reference is fundamental. On the basis of our past experience with the semantic tagging of Web resources and the SemKey Project, we are developing Tagpedia, a general-domain "encyclopedia" of tags, semantically structured for generating semantic descriptions of contents over the Web, created by mining Wikipedia. In this paper, starting from an analysis of the weak points of non-semantic keyword based Web searches, we introduce our idea of semantic characterization of Web resources describing the structure and organization of Tagpedia. We introduce our first realization of Tagpedia, suggesting all the possible improvements that can be carried out in order to exploit its full potential.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a video scene annotation method based on tag clouds. First, user comments associated with a video are collected from existing video sharing services. Next, a tag cloud is generated from these user comments. The tag cloud is displayed on the video window of the Web browser. When users click on a tag included in the tag cloud while watching the video, the tag gets associated with the time point of the video. Users can share the information on the tags that have already been clicked. We confirmed that the coverage of annotations generated by this method is higher than that of the existing methods, and users are motivated to add tags by using tag-sharing and tag-cloud methods. This method assists in establishing highly accurate advanced video applications. © 2008 Springer.},

abstract={Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one. © 2008 ACM.},

Contrary to most of current research we exclusively focus on the usage of RSS feeds for retrieval of tag-related data. Here we exploit "recent" feeds, as this method of data retrieval corresponds directly to the way users can retrieve data from these services, e.g. for tag suggestions. We motivate the preferred usage of feeds compared to full site grabbing, and present analysis results of feed data from a period of one month concerning feature distribution, growth, stability and convergence aspects. Furthermore we compare tag spaces and their intersections for potential interoperability and integration of these services, and reveal that tags in practice are not really as freely chosen as often promised.},

abstract={Folksonomies are a decentralized yet collaborative form of classification based on user-defined keywords (also known as tags). Although this uncontrolled method of classification lacks rules for term standardization and usage, it has potential for organizational patterns and an emerging vocabulary (terminology). The objective of this research is to analyze the descriptors and tags from journal articles indexed in the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and the folksonomy-based website CiteULike to determine overlap between the controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies. Metadata from 2,786 journal articles indexed in ERIC and CiteULike was collected using Perl and MySQL. The total metadata was comprised of 2,899 unique ERIC descriptors, 3,176 unique CiteULike tags, and 1,083 unique CiteULike users. An analysis of this metadata revealed that 240 of the CiteULike tags matched ERIC descriptors. The low number of tag-descriptor matches in this research indicates that CiteULike users do not use the same terminology as subject specialists who maintain descriptors in the ERIC thesaurus.

abstract={Recommender Systems (RS) aim at predicting items or ratings of items that the user are interested in. Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are "global" descriptions of items, tags are "local" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tagaware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three twodimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords - so called "tags" - to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is against the dynamically evolving nature of many contemporary media applications to be analysed in terms of conventional rigid ontologies that rely on expertise-based fixed categories and hierarchical structure. Many of these rely on sharing 'folksonomies', personal descriptions of information and objects for one's own retrieval. Such applications involve many feedback mechanisms via the community, and have been shown to have emergent properties of complex dynamic systems. We propose that such dynamically evolving information domains can be more usefully described by means of a soft ontology, a dynamically flexible and inherently spatial metadata approach for ill-defined domains. Our contribution is (1) the elaboration of the so far intuitive concept of soft ontology in a way that supports conceptualizing dynamically evolving domains. Further, our approach proposes (2) a whole new mode of interaction with information domains by means of recurring exploration of an information domain from multiple perspectives in search of more comprehensive understanding of it, i.e. multi-perspective exploration. We demonstrate this concept with an example of collaborative tagging in an educational context. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging, otherwise known as "folksonomies", emanate from the flexibility they afford users in navigating large information spaces for resources, tags, or other users, unencumbered by a pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchy. Despite its advantages, social tagging also increases user overhead in search and navigation: users are free to apply any tag they wish to a resource, often resulting in a large number of tags that are redundant, ambiguous, or idiosyncratic. Data mining techniques such as clustering provide a means to overcome this problem by learning aggregate user models, and thus reducing noise. In this paper we propose a method to personalize search and navigation based on unsupervised hierarchical agglomerative tag clustering. Given a user profile, represented as a vector of tags, the learned tag clusters provide the nexus between the user and those resources that correspond more closely to the user's intent. We validate this assertion through extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A huge amount of data and metadata emerges from Web 2.0 applications which have transformed the Web to a mass social interaction and collaboration medium. Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={While collaborative tagging is attractive because of their easy and simple way to tag and search, tag based search suffers from no semantic descriptions for contents. Semantic web technologies provide a new way to annotating and retrieving images. We address the problems of both folksonomy and semantic web annotation systems for image retrieval in particular and argue that this can be improved by giving meanings to users' tags. This paper considers using both minimized domain-specific ontology and generic ontology. We show how less detailed ontologies can help end users to annotate and search with the simple user interface. Our prototype system has the capability to describe the semantics for contents of an image. Also, no previous extra work to create instances according to the ontology for later annotations is needed. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={As the number of Web 2.0 sites offering tagging facilities for the users' voluntary content annotation increases, so do the efforts to analyze social phenomena resulting from generated tagging and folksonomies. Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused. In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as Semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the main obstacles for wider adoption of semantic rich e-learning systems is the difficulty in creating and maintaining domain ontologies describing courses. Annotations, such as those resulting from collaborative tagging, provide a new source of information which can be used to ease the process of authoring and updating domain ontologies. This paper presents an extension to the LOCO-Analyst tool, which leverages student folksonomies to support instructors when revising and updating course domain ontologies. The support is based on a computation of relatedness between ontology concepts and students tags which takes into account the "context" defined by the domain ontology. The computed scores are visualized in a tag cloud along with tag popularity scores, to allow instructors to easily comprehend the emergent feedback of their students. This approach allows for a simple and intuitive method for instructors to associate tags with concepts in their domain ontology. © 2008 IEEE.},

However, content delivering service among bloggers is not taking into account context (or semantics) of the contents, so that the service can spread irrelevant information into blogs. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a blog context overlay network architecture for context matching between blogs. It is referred to as detecting "shared" context Thus, we can identify a community of practice (CoP) on blogosphere, with respect to contexts. As a result, newly generated knowledge can be proactively diffused to the blogs of which context is relevant to the knowledge, before the bloggers' queries are asked. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A distributed classification paradigm known as collaborative tagging has been widely adopted in new Web applications designed to manage and share online resources. Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={As a representative Web 2.0 application, collaborative tagging has been widely adopted and inspires significant interest from academies. Roughly, two lines of research have been pursued: (a) studying the structure of tags, and (b) using tag to promote Web search. However, both of them remain preliminary. Research reported in this paper is aimed at addressing some of these research gaps. First, we apply complex network theory to analyze various structural properties of collaborative tagging activities to gain a detailed understanding of user tagging behavior and also try to capture the mechanism that can help explain such tagging behavior. Second, we conduct a preliminary computational study to utilize tagging information to help improve the quality of Web page recommendation. The results indicate that under the user-based recommendation framework, tags can be fruitfully exploited as they facilitate better user similarity calculation and help reduce sparsity related to past user-Web page interactions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

abstract={Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={CiteULike is a collaborative tagging web site which lets users enter academic references into a database and describe these references using tags (categorizations of their own choosing). We looked at the tagging behavior of people who were describing four frequently entered references. We found that while people tend to agree on a few select tags, people also tend to use many variants of these tags. This lack of consensus means that the collaborative aspect of tagging is not as strong as may have been suggested in the past. © 2008 The Author Published by the British Computer Society.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has grown in popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs, videos and other content. In ubiquitous computing environment, users access data through various kinds of mobile terminals. Therefore users want more accurate materials because of expensive communication cost or the useless results due to abuse of tags. In this paper, we first describe current limitation of tagging services. We then describe the system (TagPlus) we implemented to minimize ambiguity due to no synonym control. Finally, we give experimental results. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to add data items and to attach their own metadata (i.e., tags) to stored data. The result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content and the metadata become harder to manage due to increased content diversity. Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of two collaborative tagging communities that target the management of scientific literature: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover the structure of the tagging communities we study. The properties of the structure we uncover suggest a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests. Finally, we offer preliminary results that suggest that the interest-based structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content retrieval and navigation as communities scale.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

In the physical world, we use visual tags: labels readable by smartphones with cameras. While visual tags are usually related to a web site address, collaborative tagging, instead, provides updated, recommended information contributed and shared by users. In this paper we investigate the combination of collaborative tagging systems with visual tags. We present a prototype of a semiautomatic system generating visual tags which gather information from collaborative tagging. The user can interact with a list of relevant tags (built by clustering closely related tags) that can be further encoded in a visual tag, according to user's preferences. The user experience is enriched by retrieving multimedia content linked to the selected tags, present on the web. We finally show a case study illustrating our approach. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.},

abstract={The ontology development process is typically led by single or small groups of experts, with users mostly playing a passive role. Such an elitist approach in building ontologies hinders the primary purpose of large-scale knowledge sharing. Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a new web annotation method proving appealing features in fostering users to collaboratively organize information through their own metadata. Collaborative tagging shifts the creation of metadata for indexing web resources, from an individual professional activity to a collective endeavor, where every user is a potential contributor. In this paper we introduce an approach to knowledge evolution which aims to exploit the ability of collaborative tagging in fostering community members participation to move forward an initial knowledge structure. We present user scenarios about how subscribers of a scientific digital library might play the role of knowledge organizers through personal organization and sharing of citations of interest.},

abstract={The emergence of collaborative tagging systems with their underlying flat and uncontrolled resource organization paradigm has led to a large number of research activities focussing on a formal description and analysis of the resulting "folksonomies". An interesting outcome is that the characteristic qualities of these systems seem to be inverse to more traditional knowledge structuring approaches like taxonomies or ontologies: The latter provide rich and precise semantics, but suffer - amongst others - from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. An important step towards exploiting the possible synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy. This position paper presents preliminary results of ongoing work to induce hierarchical relationships among tags by analyzing the aggregated data of collaborative tagging systems as a basis for an ontology learning procedure.},

abstract={Although social, collaborative classification through tagging has been the focus of recent research, the effect of multilingual tags is often overlooked. This work presents an early exploratory study of the production and consumption of multilingual tags in a European educational K-12 context. The data, produced by teachers bookmarking and tagging learning resources during three month period, was analysed. Thereafter, a focus group of teachers evaluated a sample of learning resources with metadata records containing both thesaurus terms and multilingual tags. The results of this early study suggest that some tags are found as useful as thesaurus terms and that users are divided about the benefits of multilingual tags. As some tags are useful for some users, "hiding all but the right tags" becomes crucial for the success of a multilingual collaborative tagging system.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign kyeword-so called "tags"-to resources. Tags are used for navigation finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we present two tag recommendation algorithms: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, an adaptation of the well-known PageRank algorithm that can cope with undirected triadic hyperedges. We evaluate and compare both algorithms on large-scale real life datasets and show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably.},

Total 28,792 mature documents selected from del.icio.us are taken as answer keys. The experimental results show that this approach predicts 71.28% of a 100 users' tag set with only 5 users' tagging records, and 84.76% of a 13-month tag set with only 1-month tagging record under the precision rates of 82.43% and 89.67%, respectively. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

With KeepUP, we outline the design of a recommendation process that is based on an implicit social network where the relevancy and meaning of information can be negotiated not only with the recommender system but also with other users.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy. One problem offolksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task. © 2007 IEEE.},

Indeed, expressing expert knowledge in a given formalism is a tedious process. Less structured annotations such as tagging have, however, proved immensely popular, whilst existing unstructured or semi-structured collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have proven to be useful and scalable. Both processes are often regulated through social mechanisms such as wiki-like operations, recommendations, ratings, and collaborative games. To promote collaborative tagging as a means to acquire unstructured as well as structured knowledge we introduce the notion of Extreme Tagging, which describes systems which allow the tagging of resources, as well as of tags themselves and their relations. We provide a formal description of extreme tagging followed by examples and highlight the necessity of regulatory processes which can be applied to it. We also present a prototype implementation.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords-so called "tags"-to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare two recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, We show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={When authors publish their interpretations of the ideas, opinions, claims or rebuttals in the literature, they are drawing on a repertoire of well understood moves, contributing to an extended discourse. Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

abstract={A large part of the modern web is characterized by usergenerated content categorized using collaborative tagging or folksonomy. It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community web sites. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including whether coherent categorization schemes can emerge from unsupervised tagging by users. This paper uses data from the social bookmarking site delicio. us to examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we examine whether the distribution of the frequency of use of tags for "popular" sites with a long history (many tags and many users) can be described by a power law distribution, often characteristic of what are considered complex systems. We produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to understand the basic dynamics behind tagging, including how a power law distribution of tags could arise. We empirically examine the tagging history of sites in order to determine how this distribution arises over time and to determine the patterns prior to a stable distribution. Lastly, by focusing on the high-frequency tags of a site where the distribution of tags is a stabilized power law, we show how tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags can be used to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags.},

This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Folksonomies have the potential to add much value to public library catalogues by enabling clients to: store, maintain, and organize items of interest in the catalogue using their own tags. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the tags that constitute folksonomies are structured. Tags were acquired over a thirty-day period from the daily tag logs of three folksonomy sites, Del.icio.us, Furl, and Technorati. The tags were evaluated against section 6 (choice and form of terms) of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) guidelines for the construction of controlled vocabularies. This evaluation revealed that the folksonomy tags correspond closely to the NISO guidelines that pertain to the types of concepts expressed by the tags, the predominance of single tags, the predominance of nouns, and the use of recognized spelling. Potential problem areas in the structure of the tags pertain to the inconsistent use of the singular and plural form of count nouns, and the incidence of ambiguous tags in the form of homographs and unqualified abbreviations or acronyms. Should library catalogues decide to incorporate folksonomies, they could provide clear guidelines to address these noted weaknesses, as well as links to external dictionaries and references sources such as Wikipedia to help clients disambiguate homographs and to determine if the full or abbreviated forms of tags would be preferable.

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Finding good keywords to describe resources is an on-going problem. Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

abstract={The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

abstract={In this paper, we adopt a system-oriented approach to the collaborative tagging and define it as a set of interactions in the system of Web resources. First, the system of Web resources is modeled as a set of interacting agents and collaborative tagging is represented as concurrent initiation of interactions between agents in the system. Also, we define concept of knowledge for individual agents. Later we use concepts of interaction and knowledge to give definition of a Link. Then, for a given Universal Set of Resources, we introduce Tag Cloud System (TCS) and definition of (possibly fuzzy) collections of resources. Finally, we introduce concept of Class, based on projection of collections of resources in the TCS, to lay down some of the groundwork towards TCS-based type system.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the tagging patterns exhibited by users of del.icio.us, to assess how collaborative tagging supports and enhances traditional ways of classifying and indexing documents. Using frequency data and co-word analysis matrices analyzed by multi-dimensional scaling, the authors discovered that tagging practices to some extent work in ways that are continuous with conventional indexing. Small numbers of tags tend to emerge by unspoken consensus, and inconsistencies follow several predictable patterns that can easily be anticipated. However, the tags also indicated intriguing practices relating to time and task which suggest the presence of an extra dimension in classification and organization, a dimension which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have become rather popular for annotating any kind of resources ranging from electronic documents to real world objects. In current tagging systems resources as a whole are annotated with and referenced by user defined tags. For multimedia data, as e. g. for video data, single scenes can be identified and annotated by using MPEG-7 metadata. We propose a collaborative tagging system that is combined with an automated annotation system for synchronized multimedia presentations. MPEG-7 metadata are used for the annotation of single scenes with user compiled tagging information in combination with metadata provided directly by the author or by other annotation systems. Thus, we propose a system being able to search within multimedia data that can further be extended to search within any kind of (partial) document to achieve a more tightly focused and personalized search.},

The additional semantic structure is aggregated both implicitly observing user behaviour and explicitly introducing a compelling user experience to facilitate the creation of relationships between tags directly by end-users.

Users of these applications organize resources by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we regard tags as basic dynamical entities and study the semiotic dynamics underlying collaborative tagging. We collect data from a popular system and focus on tags associated with a given resource. We find that the frequencies of tags obey to a generalized Zipf's law and show that a Yule-Simon process with memory can be used to explain the observed frequency distributions in terms of a simple model of user behavior.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to provide an overview of the collaborative tagging phenomenon and explore some of the reasons for its emergence. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the related literature and discusses some of the problems associated with, and the potential of, collaborative tagging approaches for knowledge organisation and general resource discovery. A definition of controlled vocabularies is proposed and used to assess the efficacy of collaborative tagging. An exposition of the collaborative tagging model is provided and a review of the major contributions to the tagging literature is presented. Findings - There are numerous difficulties with collaborative tagging systems (e.g. low precision, lack of collocation, etc.) that originate from the absence of properties that characterise controlled vocabularies. However, such systems can not be dismissed. Librarians and information professionals have lessons to learn from the interactive and social aspects exemplified by collaborative tagging systems, as well as their success in engaging users with information management. The future co-existence of controlled vocabularies and collaborative tagging is predicted, with each appropriate for use within distinct information contexts: Formal and informal. Research limitations/implications - Librarians and information professional researchers should be playing a leading role in research aimed at assessing the efficacy of collaborative tagging in relation to information storage, organisation, and retrieval, and to influence the future development of collaborative tagging systems. Practical implications - The paper indicates clear areas where digital libraries and repositories could innovate in order to better engage users with information. Originality/value - At time of writing there were no literature reviews summarising the main contributions to the collaborative tagging research or debate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Semantic Web mission is to enable a better organization of the Web content to improve the searching, navigation and integration of the available information. Although the Semantic Web is intended for machines, the process of creating and maintaining it is a social one: only people, for example, have necessary skills to create and maintain ontologies. While most existing ontologies are designed by single individuals or small groups of experts, actual ontology users are not involved in the development process. Such an individual approach in creating ontologies, lead to a weak community grounding. On the other hand, Social Software is becoming increasingly popular among web users, giving opportunities to exploit the potential of collaboration within a community. Tools like wikis and folksonomies allow users to easily create new content and share contributions over a social network. Social Software tools can go beyond their current limits, by exploiting the power provided by semantic technologies. Conversely, Semantic Web tools can benefit from the ability of Social Software in fostering collaboration among users, by lowering entry barriers. In this paper we propose a new approach for ontology evolution, considering collaborative tagging systems as an opportunity to complement classic approaches used in maintaining ontologies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

School and spotted mackerel were recaptured at rates of 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. School mackerel moved small distances from their release sites (26 ± 55 km, mean ± s.d.; maximum distance, 270 km), with these restricted movements indicating the possible existence of a number of stocks. In contrast, spotted mackerel moved large distances from their release sites (202 ± 290 km; maximum distance, 1100 km). Temporal and spatial movement patterns of spotted mackerel were characteristic of fish from a single stock undertaking a seasonal migration. Commercial harvest information in combination with tagging effort reflected the different movements of school and spotted mackerel and strengthened the suggested stock structure of each species.},

abstract={Annotations provide a valuable perspective on the semantic information present in digital heritage collections, and in recent years they've been employed in a number of innovative, user-centric techniques that can personalise a user's experience of heritage materials, such as by actively adapting exhibits as a user reveals their interests, or by guiding users to explore collections which are meaningfully linked to what they have previously encountered. Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Information extraction relevant to the user queries is the challenging task in the ontology environment due to data varieties such as image, video, and text. The utilization of appropriate semantic entities enables the content-based search on annotated text. Recently, the automatic extraction of textual content in the audio-visual content is an advanced research area in a multimedia (MM) environment. The annotation of the video includes several tags and comments. This paper proposes the Collaborative Tagging (CT) model based on the Block Acquiring Page Segmentation (BAPS) method to retrieve the tag-based information. The information extraction in this model includes the Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) based on the single ontology utilization. The semantic annotation phase in the proposed work inserts the metadata with limited machine-readable terms. The insertion process is split into two major processes such as database uploading to server and extraction of images/web pages based on the results of semantic phase. Novel weight-based novel clustering algorithms are introduced to extract knowledge from MM contents. The ranking based on the weight value in the semantic annotation phase supports the image/web page retrieval process effectively. The comparative analysis of the proposed BAPS-CT with the existing information retrieval (IR) models regarding the average precision rate, time cost, and storage space rate assures the effectiveness of BAPS-CT in OMIR. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={With the prosperity and popularity of social tagging communities, developing an enormous amount of user-generated data with modalities has emerged in recent years. Personalized search based on tag-based profiles, an indispensable and prominent way to assist users to access and retrieve their interested resources, has been extensively studied by research communities. In this paper, we revisit the extant profiling approaches to personalized search in collaborative tagging systems. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) how many tags are sufficient for user and resource profiling? and (ii) under what circumstances should profile enriching/refining techniques be used to promote the effectiveness of personalized search? The result of our experimental studies in a real-world dataset indicate that the rational size of tags for constructing user/resource profiles does exist. This size can also provide us with an insight into when profiles should be enriched or refined for active/inactive users and resources. We believe the findings of this paper can be quite useful for the future applications in social tagging systems such as user interest predictions or resource recommendations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of the file systems today are based on desktop metaphor utilizing hierarchies of folders and sub-folders for information storage and retrieval. A folder is usually assumed to store the semantically related information in the form of files and sub-folders. However, there always exist related files somewhere else in the local file system hierarchy. Users often fail to find these disconnected files or discover the relationship among these. File systems maintain a plain set of metadata items about each file which could be utilized to discover some of the hidden relationships. However, this meta-information is very sparse as most of this metadata is rarely entered by the user. Moreover, files in a file system are mostly private and cannot get the benefit of collaborative tagging. Web of Data, on the other hand also contains information related to the file system objects which could be utilized for linking with information in file systems. The purpose of introducing Linked Data technology was to solve similar issues on the web. This article investigates the exploitation of Linked Data technology in file systems and provides a comprehensive review on the possible use of Linked Data Technology in file systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The scale of the social web has integrated users in order to organize shared resources. Users freely associate keywords (tags) to resources. This collection of tags creates a folksonomy. Folksonomy is a collaborative tagging system, which has grown popular with its simplicity of free tagging. However, it rises up a number of issues such as ambiguous and redundant tags. So as to achieve an optimal organized web contents, it's important to challenge the effectiveness of folksonomy to enrich ontology. Indeed, this article represents a folks-Ontology semantic enrichment approach based on a contextual mapping between tags and concepts of the ontology. Thus, the act of tagging resources can improve to make relevant recommendations. The analysis of the reconciliation between conceptual ontology models with folksonomy leads us to establish new challenges for our future research to enhance recommender systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Alongside the enormous volume of user-generated content posted to World Wide Web, there exists a thriving demand for search personalization services, especially those utilizing collaborative tagging data. To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Recommender systems allow the exploration of large collections of products, the discovery of patterns in the products, and the guidance of users towards products that match their interests. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label products in a collection using a free vocabulary. The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users. This experience showed that TagProfiles are easier to understand and modify by users, allowing them to discover new movies as they interact with their profiles.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging which is the keystone of the social practices of web 2.0 has been highly developed in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a new method to analyze user profiles according to their tagging activity in order to improve resource recommendation. We base upon association rules which is a powerful method to discover interesting relationships among large datasets on the web. Focusing on association rules we can find correlations between tags in a social network. Our aim is to recommend resources annotated with tags suggested by association rules, in order to enrich user profiles. The effectiveness of the recommendation depends on the resolution of social tagging drawbacks. In our recommender process, we demonstrate how we can reduce tag ambiguity and spelling variations problems by taking into account social similarities calculated on folksonomies, in order to personalize resource recommendation. We surmount also the lack of semantic links between tags during the recommendation process. Experiments are carried out with two different scenarios: the first one is a proof of concept over two baseline datasets and the second one is a real world application for diabetes disease.},

abstract={Massive amounts of data are available on social websites, therefore finding the suitable item is a challenging issue. According to recent social statistics, we have more than 930 million people are using WhatsApp with more than 340 million active daily users and 955 million people who access Facebook daily with an average daily photo uploads up to 325 million. The approach presented in this paper employs the collaborative tagging accumulated by huge number of users to improve social media recommendation. Our approach has two phases, in the first phase, we compute the tag-item weight model and in the second phase, we compute the user-tag preference model. After that we employ the two models to find the suitable items tailored to the user’s preferences and recommend the items with the highest score. Also our model can compute the tag score and suggest the tags with the highest weight to the user according to their preferences. The experiment results performed on Flicker and MovieLens prove that our approach is capable to improve the social media recommendation. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={With the explosive growth of user-generated multimedia resources in the big data era (e.g., video, audio, text or even their combinations), bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics in multiple modes of data is a critical and indispensable issue. In this paper, we exploit a popular type of metadata called collaborative tags to address this issue. Specifically, we identify basic level concepts and then construct ontologies from the collaborative tags. The generated ontologies can be employed to organize and index user-generated multimedia data. Existing research lacks a principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human perspective. In contrast, we borrow the idea of a family of concepts called basic level concepts from cognitive psychology. These basic level concepts are frequently used by people in their daily life and when organizing human knowledge. In this paper, we extract ontologies with basic level concepts from collaborative tags. Furthermore, we model the effect of context and present a method for context-aware basic level concepts detection for ontology learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on context-aware basic level concept detection in collaborative tagging for the construction of ontologies. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were conducted on real datasets using the Open Directory Project (ODP) as a benchmark. The experimental results illustrate that ontologies extracted by our approach are more rational and human-oriented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Folksonomies – large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by independent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing information. In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

abstract={Personalized service recommendation becomes increasingly essential because of the growing number of services. To enhance the performance of personalized service recommendation in collaborative tagging systems, not only tag information but also time and social relations information should be considered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method aiming at taking advantage of tag, time and users' social relations information for a preferable service recommendation. We first improve a simple tag-based recommendation method by a time-decay function. Then we develop a temporal social-based recommendation method which analyzes user familiarity and user preference similarity between friends. Based on these two steps we integrate them as a temporal tag-and social-based (TTS) recommendation algorithm. Experiment results indicate that our method outperforms general tag-based and social-based recommendation methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In social tagging systems, like Mendeley, CiteULike, and BibSonomy, users can post, tag, visit, or export scholarly publications. In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage points. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={With the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies, folksonomy which is also known as social tagging or collaborative tagging is widely used by learners to annotate and categorize their learning resources. In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, have grown in popularity over the Web on account of their simplicity to organize several types of content (e.g., Web pages, pictures, and video) using open-ended tags. The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems. Current recommendation approaches stemming from fields such as user modeling, collaborative filtering, content, and link-analysis are reviewed and discussed to provide a starting point for researchers in the field as well as explore future research lines. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Tagging (or bookmarking) online resources with representative keywords is one of the most popular and practical approaches for giving identity to the objects. Human taggers in social tagging systems give identity to the objects. Tagged objects also represent the perception or identity of their human taggers in return. Although users' interest and their perception about Web content might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects. These approaches always recommend objects to the users based on their fixed, defined identities since they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our social semantic tagging system, COD (Collaborative Ontology Development), we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of relevant users [1]. In this poster, we present how entrepreneurs can define a reliable representation of their commonsense knowledge about different entrepreneurial entities by using COD. CODer Entrepreneurs in the automatically formed communities can dynamically improve identity of the entrepreneurial objects related to their expertise or interests.},

abstract={As an example of exploring human memory cue use in an ecologically valid context, we present ongoing work to examine the “memory cue hypothesis” in collaborative tagging. In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Web 2.0 communities, there has been a tremendous increase in user-generated content. Confronting such a vast volume of resources in collaborative tagging systems, users require a novel method for fast exploring and indexing so as to find their desired data. To this end, contextual information is indispensable and critical in understanding user preferences and intentions. In sociolinguistics, context can be classified as verbal context and social context. Compared with verbal context, social context requires not only domain knowledge to build pre-defined contextual attributes but also additional user data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed the issue of irrelevant contextual factors for the verbal context model. To bridge this gap, the dominating set obtained from verbal context is proposed in this paper. We present (i) the verbal context graph to model contents and interrelationships of verbal context in folksonomy and thus capture the user intention; (ii) a method of discovering dominating set that provides a good balance of essentiality and integrality to de-emphasize irrelevant contextual factors and to keep the major characteristics of the verbal context graph; and (iii) a revised ranking method for measuring the relevance of a resource to an issued query, a discovered context and an extracted user profile. The experimental results obtained for a public dataset illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than existing baseline approaches. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of user-generated data in collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy-based) systems due to the prevailing of Web 2.0 communities. To effectively assist users to find their desired resources, it is critical to understand user behaviors and preferences. Tag-based profile techniques, which model users and resources by a vector of relevant tags, are widely employed in folksonomy-based systems. This is mainly because that personalized search and recommendations can be facilitated by measuring relevance between user profiles and resource profiles. However, conventional measurements neglect the sentiment aspect of user-generated tags. In fact, tags can be very emotional and subjective, as users usually express their perceptions and feelings about the resources by tags. Therefore, it is necessary to take sentiment relevance into account into measurements. In this paper, we present a novel generic framework SenticRank to incorporate various sentiment information to various sentiment-based information for personalized search by user profiles and resource profiles. In this framework, content-based sentiment ranking and collaborative sentiment ranking methods are proposed to obtain sentiment-based personalized ranking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of integrating sentiment information to address the problem of the personalized tag-based search in collaborative tagging systems. Moreover, we compare the proposed sentiment-based personalized search with baselines in the experiments, the results of which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we study the influences by popular sentiment dictionaries, and SenticNet is the most prominent knowledge base to boost the performance of personalized search in folksonomy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Whether traditional TV or Internet multimedia content, parental control systems based on the intermediate filtering criteria of broadcasters or content producers may be not flexible enough. From parent’s perspective, the ideal scenario would be one in which they could dynamically decide about the suitability of any content. Since this desired scenario entails many practical problems, we propose an intermediate solution where parents delegate the decision of blocking any piece of TV content on a trustworthy set of parents. Our approach provides a collaborative parental control model based on two pillar: (1) a parenting social network where parents interact, freely give their opinion about TV content and tag this content (collaborative tagging); and (2) a model of trust relationship between parents. Regarding the deployment of parental control, we introduce a parental monitoring system for DVB-IPTV content, which is based on social technologies. The proposal combines information from the service provider and from parents in a social network to predict whether content should be blocked. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Social bookmarking and tagging has emerged a new era in user collaboration. Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users' Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The hypothesis of this paper is that if folksonomies are shared conceptualizations, then using them in conceptual modeling should reduce the number of divergences between actors when they elicit terms to be part of a model (a concept map in this article). A controlled experiment of conceptual modeling was performed with experimental groups who received tags inducted from data of categorizations from Delicious and control groups who received terms extracted from Web pages categorized on Delicious.

abstract={We study how categories form and develop over time in a sensemaking task by groups of students employing a collaborative tagging system. In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have been popular on the Web. However, information overload results in the increasing need for recommender services from users, and thus item recommendation has been one of the key issues in such systems. In this paper, we examine if data fusion can be helpful for improving effectiveness of item recommendation in these systems. For this, we first summarize the state-of-the-art recommendation methods which are classified into several categories according to their algorithmic principles. Then, we experiment with about 40 recommending components against the datasets from three social tagging systems-Delicious, Lastfm and CiteULike. Based on these, several heuristic data fusion models including rank-based and score-based are used to combine selected components. We also put forward a hybrid linear combination (HLC) model for fusing item recommendation. We use four kinds of evaluation metrics, which respectively consider accuracy, inner-diversity, inter-diversity and novelty, to systematically assess quality of recommendations obtained by various components or fusion models. Depending on experimental results, combining evidence from separate components can lead to performance improvement in the accuracy of recommendations, with a little or without loss of recommendation diversity and novelty, if separate components can suggest similar sets of relevant items but recommend different sets of non-relevant items. Particularly, fusing recommendation sets formed from different combinations of profile representations and similarity functions in user-based and item-based collaborative filtering can significantly improve recommendation accuracy. In addition, some other useful findings are also drawn: (i) Using the tag to represent users profiles or items profiles maybe not as good as profiling users with the item or profiling items with the user, however, exploiting tags in the topic models and random walks can notably improve the accuracy, diversity and novelty of recommendations; (ii) Generally, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering and random walks methods are robust for the task of item recommendation in social tagging systems, thus can be chosen as the basic components of data fusion process; and (iii) The proposed method (HLC) is more flexible and robust than traditional data fusion models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

Task-oriented dialogue aims the solution of a given task in a given domain. Folksonomies are knowledge structures composed of users, tags and resources. Folksonomies emerge from the tagging process in collaborative tagging systems. Dialogues and folksonomies have in common their social dimension. One of the main characteristics of the folksonomies is its social dimension (users), which is also presented in dialogues, through the interaction between human beings. In this research, we describe a method that performs the learning of folksonomies, represented by a quadripartite model, from task-oriented dialogues. Using the learned folksonomies, we propose an approach for trend detection (those topics being discussed more than others). The main difference from others approaches is that we use the content of each resource in this process. This can be useful for instance, to retrieve the topics addressed by the interlocutors of the dialogues, in different time intervals.

abstract={Social tags take an important role in exploratory search. In collaborative tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources with tags. The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Tourist Spot Recommender Systems (TSRS) help users to find the interesting locations/spots in vicinity based on their preferences. Enriching the list of recommended spots with contextual information such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts etc. may further add value to the systems. This paper proposes the concept of information enrichment for a tourist spot recommender system. Proposed system works in collaboration with a Tourist Spot Recommender System, takes the list of spots to be recommended to the current user and collects the current contextual information for those spots. A new score/rank is computed for each spot to be recommender based on the recommender’s rank and current context and sent back to the user. Contextual information may be collected by several techniques such as sensors, collaborative tagging (folksonomy), crowdsourcing etc. This paper proposes an approach for information enrichment using just in time location aware crowdsourcing. Location aware crowdsourcing is used to get current contextual information about a spot from the crowd currently available at that spot. Most of the contextual parameters such as traffic conditions, weather conditions, crowdedness etc. are fuzzy in nature and therefore, fuzzy inference is proposed to compute a new score/rank, with each recommended spot. The proposed system may be used with any spot recommender system, however, in this work a personalized tourist spot recommender system is considered as a case for study and evaluation. A prototype system has been implemented and is evaluated by 104 real users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Here it provides a study of utilizing online travel information for the Customized travel package recommendation. However many recommender systems have been cultivated for boosting the characteristic of travel utility. Tourist Relation Area Season Topic Model is enhanced by using n-way search, this method has the capacity of finding the nearest places beyond the consumer search and hence it supports effective information for creating the packages. Tourist relation area season topic model is used as an effective evaluation for travel group formation also satisfies the consumer by suggesting recommend package. Hybrid recommendation strategy is followed to produce an efficient results to the travelers and collaborative method which detects the nearest places and conclude the expenses for the suggested places, here the data are semantically classified where the raw information is obtained by service composition function.

Recommender systems look for pattern of behavior of users to know what that particular user will prefer from catalogue of items he has never experienced before. Evolution of the technology behind recommender systems has taken place from the past 20 years. This paper proposed a hybrid recommender system for research papers, which can be used as the alternative to the current systems. This system is hybridization of content filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. This system based on bottom up approach to classify research papers i.e. users can tag their papers with their own keywords. This system uses the content and collaborative filtering techniques along with author analysis, date analysis and title analysis. This system also optimized the retrieved results by using collaborative approaches like user to item techniques and item to item technique. The proposed system has also addressed the cold start problem for the new items. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for measuring semantic similarity. Semantic similarity measures are important for various semantics-oriented natural language processing tasks, such as Textual Entailment or Word Sense Disambiguation. In the paper, a folksonomy graph is used to determine the relatedness of two words. The construction of a folksonomy from a collaborative photo tagging resource is described. The problems which occur during the process are analyzed and solutions are proposed. The structure of the folksonomy is also analyzed. It turns out to be a social network graph. Graph features, such as the path length, or the Jaccard similarity coefficient, are the input parameters for a machine learning classifying algorithm. The comparative importance of the parameters is evaluated. Finally, the method was evaluated in the RUSSE evaluation campaign. The results are lower than most results for distribution-based vector models. However, the model itself is cheaper to build. The failures of the models are analyzed and possible improvements are suggested.},

A variety of automatic and semi-automatic methods exist for extracting or assigning identity to online resources. Although users’ perception about contents and also their interests might change over time, most current approaches define a fixed identity for the objects and always recommend them to the users based on their fixed, defined identities because they use a source of knowledge that does not evolve. In our approach, we update identities of the users and Web contents dynamically based on the latest collective opinion of the evolving communities of users related to them in a social semantic tagging system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique (Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution), which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy (expressed in a FO) to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. © 2015 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Centro de Ciencias Aplicadas y Desarrollo Tecnológico. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, most social Websites allow users to annotate resources (such as Web pages and images) with keywords, i.e. tags. Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social tagging, also noted as collaborative tagging or folksonomy, is an important way for users themselves to describe resources on the Web. The tags that the web users adopt to describe the resources are called social tags, and they have been widely used and studied. However, for the absence of a central controlled vocabulary, the semantics of the social tags are ambiguous due to constant changes of either the users' interests or the informal definitions, which makes it hard to directly make use of these social tags in the web applications. In this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to automatically induce topic senses from social tags, which can then be used for the tag disambiguation. A novel automatic evaluation method is also proposed to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that the proposed topic sense induction method can help to provide precise resources search and recommendation, which is one of the key functionalities in social tagging systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Taggers in social tagging systems have the main role in giv- ing identities to the objects. Tagged objects also represent perception of their taggers about them and can define identi- Ties of their taggers in return. Consequently, identities that are assigned to the objects and taggers have efect on the quality of their categorization and communities formation around them. Tags in social semantic tagging systems have formal definitions because they are mapped to the concepts that are defined in ontologies. Semantic tags are not only able to improve quality of tag assignments by solving some common tags ambiguity problems related to classic folkson- omy systems (i.e., in particular polysemy and synonymy), but also to provide some meta data on top of the social rela- Tions based on contribution of taggers around semantic tags. Those meta data may be exploited to form dynamic com- munities which addresses the problems of lack of commonly agreed and evolving meaning of tags in social semantic tag- ging systems. This paper proposes an approach to form dynamic com- munities of related taggers around the tagged objects. Be- cause our perceptions in each specific area of knowledge is evolving over time, the goal of our approach is also to evolve the represented knowledge in semantic tagging systems dy- namically according to the latest perception of the related users. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

abstract={With the advent of the so-called "Web 2.0", the participatory nature of many of its applications has nurtured the vision of many researchers to finally overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck inherent to many Semantic Web applications. Despite the uncontrolledness and openness of platforms like collaborative tagging systems, blogs, social networks or wikis, evidence for the presence of emergent semantics within the resulting large bodies of human-annotated content was found. The strengths and weaknesses of traditional top-down approaches (like expert-defined ontologies) and this "wisdom of the crowds" approaches are obviously inverse. Therefore the idea to bridge the gap between the social and the semantic web has motivated a large number of approaches coming from different research areas. In this chapter, we will give a systematic overview of the recent trends and developments within the research branch targeted towards capturing emergent semantics from social tagging systems. Starting with an introduction to the data characteristics, we give an overview of approaches which analyze evidences and factors of emergent semantics. The following main part of this chapter is concerned with various methods geared towards making the implicit semantics within social tagging data explicit. The presentation is structured along a set of comparison dimensions, including the different levels of the ontology learning layer cake. We conclude the chapter by giving an outlook on promising future research directions.},

abstract={Compared with learning in classrooms, classical e-learning systems are less adaptive and once a system that supports a particular strategy has been designed and implemented, it is less likely to change according to student's interactions and preferences. Remote educational systems should be developed to ensure as much as necessary the personalization of learning tasks. New e-learning environments should appear to act as intelligent systems that better fit the needs of their users and especially students according to their interests, preferences, motivations, objectives and knowledge. In this paper, we present how the personalization of students' learning process leveraging the use of social semantic web, using resource description framework models, ontologies, social networking and collaborative tagging. Our aim is to develop an approach of personalization according to students' preferences, interests and knowledge by defining for them the best learning paths, this means, provide them as recommendations the best collaborators and the relevant resources that better fit their needs. We present a new method of recommendation based on users' similarity calculation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through the design, implementation, analysis and evaluation of a social learning environment. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is one of the most popular services available online, and it allows end user to loosely classify either online or offline resources based on their feedback, expressed in the form of free-text labels (i.e., tags). Although tags may not be per se sensitive information, the wide use of collaborative tagging services increases the risk of cross referencing, thereby seriously compromising user privacy. In this paper, we make a first contribution toward the development of a privacy-preserving collaborative tagging service, by showing how a specific privacy-enhancing technology, namely tag suppression, can be used to protect end-user privacy. Moreover, we analyze how our approach can affect the effectiveness of a policy-based collaborative tagging system that supports enhanced web access functionalities, like content filtering and discovery, based on preferences specified by end users. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

One of the challenging issues in this area is to successfully understand customers' affective needs and to interpret it in terms of product design elements. Previous studies have attempted to obtain customer's affective needs using manual approaches, e.g. survey, which is time-consuming and a costly process. In relation, the study for such a need is usually limited to a number of product features only. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative tagging approach for discovering product features, affective description and their associations from product review analysis. Specifically, we have discussed on the tagging task assignment, tags aggregation and performance analysis of our proposal. A case study on discovering feature-affective associations from car reviews is reported to showcase the feasibility of our approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract: Collaborative labeling portrays the process by which numerous users put in metadata in the form of keywords to shared data. Nowadays, collaborative labeling has grown in reputation on the web, on sites that permit users to label bookmarks, photographs and other details. It has been recently become useful and well known as one effective way of classifying items for future search, sharing information, and filtering. So, as to predict the future search of users, we propose a novel collaborative tagging-based page recommendation algorithm using fuzzy classifier. The method consists of three phases: Grouping, Rule Generation Phase and Page Recommendation Phase. In the proposed method, we calculate the resemblance of users in selecting tags and thereby, calculate the nearest neighbors of each user and cluster them. Then, the priority of tags and items for each user is calculated for constructing a Nominal Label Matrix and Nominal Page Matrix. Finally, the fuzzy rules are generated for page recommendation. The experimentation is carried out on delicious datasets and the experimental results ensured that the proposed algorithm has achieved the maximum hit ratio of 6.6% for neighborhood size of 20, which is higher than the existing technique which obtained only 5.5%. © 2014, Copyright: the authors.},

abstract={The rise of Web 2.0 is signaled by sites such as Flickr, del.icio.us, and YouTube, and social tagging is essential to their success. A typical tagging action involves three components, user, item (e.g., photos in Flickr), and tags (i.e., words or phrases). Analyzing how tags are assigned by certain users to certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired information. In this paper, we develop a dual mining framework to explore tagging behavior. This framework is centered around two opposing measures, similarity and diversity, applied to one or more tagging components, and therefore enables a wide range of analysis scenarios such as characterizing similar users tagging diverse items with similar tags or diverse users tagging similar items with diverse tags. By adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the framework, we show that a wide range of concrete analysis problems can be defined and they are NP-Complete in general. We design four sets of efficient algorithms for solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the exact brute-force approach without compromising analysis result quality. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article discusses the information representation process based on the Moscovici's Social Representation Theory and domain analysis in Information Science. The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the dataset, showed that the users' reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants - in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user's choice of resources, and sharing styles. Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a "gain scale" of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.},

abstract={Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With the increase in resource-sharing websites such as YouTube and Flickr, many shared resources have arisen on the Web. Personalized searches have become more important and challenging since users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized searches need to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provides a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized searches. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in collaborative tagging systems. We use a normalized term frequency to indicate the preference degree of a user on a tag. A novel search method using such profiles of users and resources is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource searches. In our framework, instead of the keyword matching or similarity measurement used in previous works, the relevance measurement between a resource and a user query (termed the query relevance) is treated as a fuzzy satisfaction problem of a user's query requirements. We implement a prototype system called the Folksonomy-based Multimedia Retrieval System (FMRS). Experiments using the FMRS data set and the MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These 'social taxonomies', which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions -from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E Steps technique - Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution -, which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy - expressed in a FO - to support ontology review and enhancement. It was implemented and tested in a visual review/enhancement tool. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In the era of big data, collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems have proliferated as a consequence of the growth of Web 2.0 communities. Constructing user profiles from folksonomy systems is useful for many applications such as personalized search and recommender systems. The identification of latent user communities is one way to better understand and meet user needs. The behavior of users is highly influenced by the behavior of their neighbors or community members, and this can be utilized in constructing user profiles. However, conventional user profiling techniques often encounter data sparsity problems as data from a single user is insufficient to build a powerful profile. Hence, in this paper we propose a method of enriching user profiles based on latent user communities in folksonomy data. Specifically, the proposed approach contains four sub-processes: (i) tag-based user profiles are extracted from a folksonomy tripartite graph; (ii) a multi-faceted folksonomy graph is constructed by integrating tag and image affinity subgraphs with the folksonomy tripartite graph; (iii) random walk distance is used to unify various relationships and measure user similarities; (iv) a novel prototype-based clustering method based on user similarities is used to identify user communities, which are further used to enrich the extracted user profiles. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a public dataset, the results of which show that our approach outperforms previous ones in user profile enrichment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A folksonomy is ostensibly an information structure built up by the "wisdom of the crowds", but is the "crowd" really doing the work? Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Background: The public typically believes psychotherapy to be more effective than pharmacotherapy for depression treatments. This is not consistent with current scientific evidence, which shows that both types of treatment are about equally effective. Objective: The study investigates whether this bias towards psychotherapy guides online information search and whether the bias can be reduced by explicitly providing expert information (in a blog entry) and by providing tag clouds that implicitly reveal experts' evaluations. Methods: A total of 174 participants completed a fully automated Web-based study after we invited them via mailing lists. First, participants read two blog posts by experts that either challenged or supported the bias towards psychotherapy. Subsequently, participants searched for information about depression treatment in an online environment that provided more experts' blog posts about the effectiveness of treatments based on alleged research findings. These blogs were organized in a tag cloud; both psychotherapy tags and pharmacotherapy tags were popular. We measured tag and blog post selection, efficacy ratings of the presented treatments, and participants' treatment recommendation after information search. Results: Participants demonstrated a clear bias towards psychotherapy (mean 4.53, SD 1.99) compared to pharmacotherapy (mean 2.73, SD 2.41; t173=7.67, P<.001, d=0.81) when rating treatment efficacy prior to the experiment. Accordingly, participants exhibited biased information search and evaluation. This bias was significantly reduced, however, when participants were exposed to tag clouds with challenging popular tags. Participants facing popular tags challenging their bias (n=61) showed significantly less biased tag selection (F2,168=10.61, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.112), blog post selection (F2,168=6.55, P=.002, partial eta squared=0.072), and treatment efficacy ratings (F2,168=8.48, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.092), compared to bias-supporting tag clouds (n=56) and balanced tag clouds (n=57). Challenging (n=93) explicit expert information as presented in blog posts, compared to supporting expert information (n=81), decreased the bias in information search with regard to blog post selection (F1,168=4.32, P=.04, partial eta squared=0.025). No significant effects were found for treatment recommendation (Ps>.33). Conclusions: We conclude that the psychotherapy bias is most effectively attenuated-and even eliminated-when popular tags implicitly point to blog posts that challenge the widespread view. Explicit expert information (in a blog entry) was less successful in reducing biased information search and evaluation. Since tag clouds have the potential to counter biased information processing, we recommend their insertion. © Holly O Witteman.},

abstract={Social tagging provides an effective way for users to organize, manage, share and search for various kinds of resources. These tagging systems have resulted in more and more users providing an increasing amount of information about themselves that could be exploited for recommendation purposes. However, since social tags are generated by users in an uncontrolled way, they can be noisy and unreliable and thus exploiting them for recommendation is a non-trivial task. In this article,a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns. We present a method for finding the underlying meanings (concepts) of the tags, mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases, namely WordNet and Wikipedia, through the exploitation of ontologies created within the W3C Linking Open Data initiative. In this way, the tag-base profiles are upgraded to semantic profiles by replacing tags with the corresponding ontology concepts. In addition, we further improve the semantic profiles through enriching them with a semantic spreading mechanism. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, a real dataset from The Del.icio.us website is used for empirical experiment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a better representation of user interests and achieves better recommendation results in terms of precision and ranking accuracy as compared to existing methods. We further investigate the recommendation performance of the proposed approach in face of the cold start problem and the result confirms that the proposed approach can indeed be a remedy for the problem of cold start users and hence improving the quality of © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this article, a new recommender system is proposed based on the similarities between user and item profiles. The approach here is to generate user and item profiles by discovering frequent user-generated tag patterns, and to enrich each individual profile by a two-phase profile enrichment procedure. The profiles are extended by association rules discovered through the association rule mining process.

abstract={With the development of the Internet, there are more and more shared resources on the Web. Personalized search becomes increasingly important as users demand higher retrieval quality. Personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags (features) and thus provide a powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. To capture and understand user preferences, a user is typically modeled as a vector of tag:value pairs (i.e., a tag-based user profile) in collaborative tagging systems. In such a tag-based user profile, a user's preference degree on a group of tags (i.e., a combination of several tags) mainly depends on the preference degree on every individual tag in the group. However, the preference degree on a combination of tags (a tag-group) cannot simply be obtained from linearly combining the preference on each tag. The combination of a user's two favorite tags may not be favorite for the user. In this article, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To overcome their problems, we model a user profile based on combinations of tags (tag-groups) and then apply it to the personalized search. By comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results on a real data set shows the effectiveness of our proposed user profile method.

Historically, the popular song has been classified as a subcategory of other musical objects. However, recent researches show that the popular song is a specific artistic form that is endowed with its own language and, therefore, demands specific techniques for analysis, representation and, consequently, classification. Considering the different approaches toward popular songs in catalogues and contemporary systems, this paper identifies possible solutions, such as the use of descriptive metadata, the use of collaborative tagging or the creation of an ontology. In discussing the construction of an epistemological foundation used specifically for classifying the popular song, we reflect on the remaining challenges for the knowledge organization of complex artistic documents.},

abstract={Recently collaborative tagging, also known as "folksonomy" in Web 2.0, allows users to collaboratively create and manage tags to classify and categorize dynamic content for searching and sharing. A user's interest in social resources usually changes with time in such a dynamic and information rich environment. Additionally, a social network is one innovative characteristic in social resource sharing websites. The information from a social network provides an inference of a certain user's interests based on the interests of this user's network neighbors. To handle the problem of personalized interests changing gradually with time, and to utilize the benefit of the social network, this study models a personalized user interest, incorporating frequency, recency, and duration of tag-based information, and performs collaborative recommendations using the user's social network in social resource sharing websites. The proposed method includes finding neighbors from the "social friends" network by using collaborative filtering and recommending similar resource items to the users by using content-based filtering. This study examines the proposed system's performance using an experimental dataset collected from a social bookmarking website. The experimental results show that the hybridization of user's preferences with frequency, recency, and duration plays an important role, and provides better performances than traditional collaborative recommendation systems. The experimental results also reveal that the friend network information can successfully collaborate, thus improving the collaborative recommendation process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

abstract={With the proliferation of social media, it is becoming important to support a significant amount of user tags in selecting the most appropriate resource description during the search process. In this paper, we propose to identify and structure the links between resources by taking into account a resource social dimension. Each resource is assigned to a cluster of tags hierarchy. The clusters of tags are formed by a classification method while the hierarchical classification of tags within clusters is defined using a hierarchy classification algorithm. User's query is expanded by a social dimension and the clusters of tags are used to facilitate the search and ranking process. The results of our experiment, crawled from Delicious Folksonomy, demonstrate significant improvement over traditional retrieval approaches. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The widespread use and growing popularity of online collaborative content sites has created rich resources for users to consult in order to make purchasing decisions on various items such as e-commerce products, restaurants, etc. Ideally, a user wants to quickly decide whether an item is desirable, from the list of items returned as a result of her search query. This has created new challenges for producers/manufacturers (e.g., Dell) or retailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay) of such items to compose succinct summarizations of web item descriptions, henceforth referred to as snippets, that are likely to maximize the items' visibility among users. We exploit the availability of user feedback in collaborative content sites in the form of tags to identify the most important item attributes that must be highlighted in an item snippet. We investigate the problem of finding the top-k best snippets for an item that are likely to maximize the probability that the user preference (available in the form of search query) is satisfied. Since a search query returns multiple relevant items, we also study the problem of finding the best diverse set of snippets for the items in order to maximize the probability of a user liking at least one of the top items. We develop an exact top-k algorithm for each of the problem and perform detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to to demonstrate the utility of our problems and effectiveness of our solutions.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular way to organize content. But sometimes it is also used as a way to express opinions, which is normally done through rating-or text review systems. This paper will demonstrate that there is a gap between rating- and text review systems, that limits the ability of users to find the desired item. A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, the (offine) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from dificulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as a powerful way to label and organize large collections of data. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. Although folksonomies and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning, the assumption that the evolving structure of these digital records contains implicit evidences for the underlying semantics has been proven by successful approaches of making the emergent semantics explicit. In this paper we propose an approach for extracting ontological structures from folksonomies that exploits the power of fuzzy clustering using new similarity and generality measure. The fuzzy clustering process discovers ambiguous tags and disambiguates them all at once, and the new similarity measure gives more accurate results as it calculates co-occurrences based on distinct users and not only in the number of co-occurrences of two distinct words. The generated ontology can be used to enhance various tasks in the tagging systems, such as tag disambiguation, result visualization, and ontology evolution. Our experimental results on real world data sets show that our method can effectively learn the ontology structure from the folksonomies. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks have become a popular medium for people to communicate and distribute ideas, content, news, and advertisements. Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction. © 2013 ACM 1046-8188/2013/11-ART19 15.00.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of web 2.0 technologies, tagging become much more important today to facilitate personal organization and also provide a possibility for users to search information or discover new things with Collaborative Tagging Systems. However, the simplistic and user-centered design of this kind of systems cause the task of finding personally interesting users is becoming quite out of reach for the common user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) seems to be the most popular technique in recommender systems to deal with information overload issue but CF suffers from accuracy limitation. This is because CF always been attack by malicious users that will make it suffers in finding the truly interesting users. With this problem in mind, this study proposes a hybrid User Trust method to enhance CF in order to increase accuracy of user recommendation in social tagging system. This method is a combination of developing trust network based on user interest similarity and trust network from social network analysis. The user interest similarity is derived from personalized user tagging information. The hybrid User Trust method is able to find the most trusted users and selected as neighbours to generate recommendations. Experimental results show that the hybrid method outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. In addition, it indicated that the hybrid method give more accurate recommendation than the existing CF based on user trust. © 2013 Science Publications.},

Moreover, only the matching degree of a tag with another tag is calculated, while the effects of tags as a whole on the user's preference are ignored. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on the tag-group effect, namely, TGER. This algorithm utilizes the user ratings on resources to select the tag-groups which have significant effects on the user's preference, and adopts the high-dimension tag-group first matching method to calculate the user-resource relevance. Experimental results on the MovieLens data set show that TGER can significantly improve the recommendation quality.},

abstract={Graphs are a fundamental data structure and have been employed to model objects as well as their relationships. The similarity of objects on the web (e.g., webpages, photos, music, micro-blogs, and social networking service users) is the key to identifying relevant objects in many recent applications. SimRank, proposed by Jeh and Widom, provides a good similarity score and has been successfully used in many applications such as web spam detection, collaborative tagging analysis, link prediction, and so on. SimRank computes similarities iteratively, and it needs O(N4T) time and O(N 2) space for similarity computation where N and T are the number of nodes and iterations, respectively. Unfortunately, this iterative approach is computationally expensive. The goal of this work is to process top-k search and range search efficiently for a given node. Our solution, SimMat, is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the approximate similarity of a selected node pair efficiently in non-iterative style based on the Sylvester equation, and (2) It prunes unnecessary approximate similarity computations when searching for the high similarity nodes by exploiting estimations based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. These two ideas reduce the time and space complexities of the proposed approach to O(Nn) where n is the target rank of the low-rank approximation (n ≪ N in practice). Our experiments show that our approach is much faster, by several orders of magnitude, than previous approaches in finding the high similarity nodes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a commonly used technique in recommendation systems. It can promote items of interest to a target user from a large selection of available items. It is divided into two broad classes: memory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. The latter requires some time to build a model but recommends online items quickly, while the former is time-consuming but does not require pre-building time. Considering the shortcomings of the two types of algorithms, we propose a novel Community-based User domain Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm (CUCRA). The idea comes from the fact that recommendations are usually made by users with similar preferences. The first step is to build a user-user social network based on users' preference data. The second step is to find communities with similar user preferences using a community detective algorithm. Finally, items are recommended to users by applying collaborative filtering on communities. Because we recommend items to users in communities instead of to an entire social network, the method has perfect online performance. Applying this method to a collaborative tagging system, experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy of CUCRA is relatively good, and the online time-complexity reduces to O.n/.},

A number of models of tagging behaviour have been proposed to identify factors that are considered to affect taggers, such as users' tagging history. In this paper, we use Semiotics Analysis and Activity theory, to study the effect the system designer has over tagging behaviour. The framework we use shows the components that comprise the tagging system and how they interact together to direct tagging behaviour. We analysed two collaborative tagging systems: CiteULike and Delicious by studying their components by applying our framework. Using datasets from both systems, we found that 35% of CiteULike users did not provide tags compared to only 0.1% of Delicious users. This was directly linked to the type of tools used by the system designer to support tagging.},

abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, such as web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Ontologies, folksonomy and personomy are employed in KAM to constitute the useful repositories of knowledge. Ontologies offer a flexible and expressive layer of abstraction, very useful for capturing the semantics of information repositories, but they can not reflect the user's interest. The user in KAM can freely choose the words to tag the resources which are the reflection of the user's own interest. The set of tags and tagged knowledge of a user comprise the personomy. In a group the shared tags and knowledge are known as folksonomy. Our approach investigates how to map these tags in personomy and folksonomy to existing domain ontology in order to add accurate meanings. The user's behaviors are also used to re-rank the query results. So the user can find the useful knowledge quickly and accurately.},

abstract={Some of the most remarkable innovative technologies from the Web 2.0 are the collaborative tagging systems. They allow the use of folksonomies as a useful structure for a number of tasks in the social web, such as navigation and knowledge organization. One of the main deficiencies comes from the tagging behaviour of different users which causes semantic heterogeneity in tagging. As a consequence a user cannot benefit from the adequate tagging of others. In order to solve the problem, an agent-based reconciliation knowledge system, based on Formal Concept Analysis, is applied to facilitate the semantic interoperability between personomies. This article describes experiments that focus on conceptual structures produced by the system when it is applied to a collaborative tagging service, Delicious. Results will show the prevalence of shared tags in the sharing of common resources in the reconciliation process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={As a storage and retrieval unit of user generated web objects, set has been receiving increased attention recently in information retrieval research community. Set search requires relevant sets to be retrieved to meet information needs of users. It is different from individual object search in terms of content granularity. While a web object itself is not divisible and independent with each other, a set consists of separable objects that are related in some aspects. This paper proposes a new approach that can effectively measure topical relevance of sets against a user query by utilizing the tags attached to web objects. The main idea of the proposed approach is to prefer the set which covers as many query related subtopics as possible. In particular, in order to compute the topical relevance while addressing the problem of noisy tags, the notion of tag significance score is introduced based on tag co-occurrence frequency. We consider a problem domain of photo set search at flickr.com where individual photos are annotated with texts such as titles and tags. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous approaches for photo set retrieval. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Tagging is a popular way to annotate web 2.0 web sites. A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as a common solution for labelling and organising online digital content. However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a semantically enhanced tag-based approach to music recommendation. While most of approaches to tag-based recommendation are based on tag frequency, our approach is based on semantics of tags. In order to extract semantics of tags, we developed the emotion ontology for music called UniEmotion, which categorizes tags into positive emotional tags, negative emotional tags, and factual tags. According to the types of the tags, their weights are calculated and assigned to them. After then, user profiles using the weighted tags were generated and a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm was executed. To evaluate our approach, a data set of 1,100 users, tags which they added, and artists which they listened to was collected from last.fm. The conventional track-based recommendation, the unweighted tag-based recommendation, and the weighted tag-based recommendation are compared in terms of precision. Our experimental results show that the weighted tag-based recommendation outperforms other two approaches in terms of precision. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Background: Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. Objective: The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. Methods: First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. Results: Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the so-called Web 2.0 has changed the surfers' behavior. A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={While recommendation approaches exploiting different input sources have started to proliferate in the literature, an explicit study of the effect of the combination of heterogeneous inputs is still missing. On the other hand, in this context there are sides to recommendation quality requiring further characterisation and methodological research - a gap that is acknowledged in the field. We present a comparative study on the influence that different types of information available in social systems have on item recommendation. Aiming to identify which sources of user interest evidence - tags, social contacts, and user-item interaction data - are more effective to achieve useful recommendations, and in what aspect, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering, and social recommenders on three datasets obtained from Delicious, Last. fm, and MovieLens. Aiming to determine whether and how combining such information sources may enhance over individual recommendation approaches, we extend the common accuracy-oriented evaluation practice with various metrics to measure further recommendation quality dimensions, namely coverage, diversity, novelty, overlap, and relative diversity between ranked item recommendations. We report empiric observations showing that exploiting tagging information by content-based recommenders provides high coverage and novelty, and combining social networking and collaborative filtering information by hybrid recommenders results in high accuracy and diversity. This, along with the fact that recommendation lists from the evaluated approaches had low overlap and relative diversity values between them, gives insights that meta-hybrid recommenders combining the above strategies may provide valuable, balanced item suggestions in terms of performance and non-performance metrics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={While research on collaborative tagging systems has largely been the purview of computer scientists, the behavior of these systems is driven by the psychology of their users. Here we explore how simple models of boundedly rational human decision making may partly account for the high-level properties of a collaborative tagging environment, in particular with respect to the distribution of tags used across the folkson-omy. We discuss several plausible heuristics people might employ to decide on tags to use for a given item, and then describe methods for testing evidence of such strategies in real collaborative tagging data. Using a large dataset of annotations collected from users of the social music website Last.fm with a novel crawling methodology (approximately one millions total users), we extract the parameters for our decision-making models from the data. We then describe a set of simple multi-agent simulations that test our heuristic models, and compare their results to the extracted parameters from the tagging dataset. Results indicate that simple social copying mechanisms can generate surprisingly good fits to the empirical data, with implications for the design and study of tagging systems.},

abstract={Tags can be used to annotate resources on the web. This enables users to share or browse the resources or retrieve them in future. Collaborative Tagging systems or folksonomies have the potential to become an integral part of Web 2.0. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a powerful tool commonly used in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and with the Semantic Web. FCA has been used in online document and resource management systems. In this case the resources are treated as objects and tags as attributes. FCA groups these resources hierarchically in a lattice structure thereby providing multiple dimensions to information retrieval. Objects are grouped with a set of attributes common to all of them. These groups are called concepts and are the building blocks of FCA lattices. A system is discussed that models objects and their tags with Formal Concept Analysis. A user's query for objects with certain attributes can be mapped to a particular concept. The objects of this concept can be returned as results. Further related and relevant results can be provided by finding the concepts most similar to the result concept and returning their objects to the user as well. Thus, an information retrieval system can be implemented. Further automation can be investigated with machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to describe and organize items using labels in a free-shared vocabulary (tags), improving their browsing experience in large collections of items. At present, the most accurate collaborative filtering techniques build user profiles in latent factor spaces that are not interpretable by users. In this paper, we propose a general method to build linear-interpretable user profiles that can be used for user interaction in a recommender system, using the well-known simple additive weighting model (SAW) for multi-attribute decision making. In experiments, two kinds of user profiles where tested: one from free contributed tags and other from keywords automatically extracted from textual item descriptions. We compare them for their ability to predict ratings and their potential for user interaction. As a test bed, we used a subset of the database of the University of Minnesota's movie review system-Movielens, the social tags proposed by Vig et al. (2012) in their work "The Tag Genome", and movie synopses extracted from the Netflix's API. We found that, in "warm" scenarios, the proposed tag and keyword-based user profiles produce equal or better recommendations that those based on latent-factors obtained using matrix factorization. Particularly, the keyword-based approach obtained 5.63% of improvement. In cold-start conditions-movies without rating information, both approaches perform close to average. Moreover, a user profile visualization is proposed arising an accuracy vs. interpretability tradeoff between tag and keyword-based profiles. While keyword-based profiles produce more accurate recommendations, tag-based profiles seems to be more readable, meaningful and convenient for creating profile-based user interfaces.

abstract={Folksonomies are increasingly adopted in web systems. These "social taxonomies", which emerge from collaborative tagging, contrast with the formalism and the systematic creation process applied to ontologies. However, they can play complementary roles, as the knowledge systematically formalized in ontologies by a restricted group can be enriched by the implicit knowledge collaboratively produced by a much wider group. Existing initiatives that involve folksonomies and ontologies are often unidirectional, i.e., ontologies improve tag operations or tags are used to automatically create ontologies. We propose a new fusion approach in which the semantics travels in both directions-from folksonomies to ontologies and vice versa. The result of this fusion is our Folksonomized Ontology (FO). In this paper, we present our 3E steps technique-Extraction, Enrichment, and Evolution-which explores the latent semantics of a given folksonomy-expressed in a FO-to support ontology review and enhancement.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the most popular tools for Web search users to find their desired information. Indeed, the informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. The widely keyword-based approaches used for locating information on the Web, are hence not straightforwardly adaptable to folksonomies. This drawback has created the need for an effective framework to support folksonomy users in effectively retrieving the resources matching their real search intents. The primary focus of this paper is to propose an integrated approach for context-aware query recommendation infolksonomies that exploits the power of both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and triadic concepts. We demonstrate through carried out experiments that the proposed approach yields mainly highly Precise and highly Relevant tag query recommendation.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the growth patterns of tag vocabulary in collaborative tagging systems to verify the sustainability and stabilization of tag distributions. Both sustainability and stabilization are essential to the mining and categorization of information driven by tagging behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on time series data of CiteULike from November 2004 to April 2010. Power law distributions were detected to reveal statistical regularities and tagging patterns. Logistic regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted to identify the factors affecting the growth of distinct tags for articles. The significance of the effects and the time taken for a given article to reach its tagging maturity were also explored. Findings - Time series plots and trend analysis illustrated the continuous growth of the tagging system. Exploratory analysis of power law distribution fittings indicated a sign of system stability known as scale invariance. Logistic regression results demonstrated that for a particular article, the number of users who tagged the article, the initial date when the article was tagged, and the life span of the article are statistically significant to the ratio of the distinct tag number to the total tag number for a given article. These results confirmed that the distinct tag ratio of an article gives rise to a stable pattern. Originality/value - Though extensive work has been done on the patterns of tag vocabulary, it is not clear how the growth of distinctive tags behaves in relation to the total number of tag applications, considering time-dependent covariates such as the number of users, and the longevity of an article. This paper sets to complement the literature on the existing methodology and investigate this property in detail. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Social Web makes visible the ebb and flow of popular interest in topics both newsworthy (\GulfSpill") and trivial (\Lolcat"). Understanding this emergent behavior is a fun- damental goal for Social Web research. Key problems in- clude discovering emergent topics from online text sources, modeling burst activity, and predicting the future trajec- tory of a given topic. Past work has addressed such prob- lems individually for specific applications, but has lacked a generalizable framework for performing both classification and prediction of topic usage. Our approach is to model a topic as a temporally ordered sequence of derived feature states and capture characteristic changes in the topic trend. These sequences are drawn from a dynamic segmentation of frequency data based on change point analysis. We employ Partitioning Around Medoids clustering on these segments to produce signatures which highlight characteristic patterns of usage growth and decay. We demonstrate how this signa- ture model can be used to define distinctive classes of topics in multiple online contexts, including tagging systems and web-based information retrieval. Additionally, we show how the model can predict the general trajectory of interest in a particular topic. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Many software engineering tasks, such as feature location and duplicate bug report detection, leverages similarities among textual corpora. However, due to the different words used by developers to express the same concept, exact matching of words is insufficient. One document can contain a particular word while the other document may contain another word that is semantically related but is not the same. Such word differences may cause inaccuracies in subsequent software engineering tasks. Recently, tagging has impacted the software engineering community. Developers increasingly use tags to describe important features of a software product. Many project hosting sites allow users to tag various projects with their own words. It becomes increasingly important to understand and relate these tags. Based on the tags available from software project hosting websites, we propose a similarity metric to infer semantically related terms, each of which is a tag, and build a taxonomy that could further describe the relationships among these terms. We have built a sample taxonomy from tens of thousands of projects and their tags. Our user studies show that our proposed similarity metric for tags are indeed related to the semantic similarity of the terms, and the resultant semantic taxonomy among terms is reasonably good. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Originally introduced by social bookmarking systems, collaborative tagging, or social tagging, has been widely adopted by many web-based systems like wikis, e-commerce platforms, or social networks. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={A new collaborative approach in information organization and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI), which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200 and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two factors along with the selection of a similarity metric. The study also tests some experimental conditions for detecting social tags with high CI degree. The results of this study can be applicable to the study of filtering social tags based on CI; filtered social tags may be utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as an efficient way to semantically describe online resources shared by a community of users. However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users. We analyze the performance of two probabilistic approaches to recommend tags from users with similar tagging behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={As the number of Web services dramatically increases, it is becoming more difficult and time consuming for user to find the desired Web services. Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between cooccurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases, where a dimension is a set of mutually exclusive itemsets. The problem we consider requires to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other and which provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose can be interpreted as a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Relying on information-theoretic concepts, we formulate the diverse dimension decomposition problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity, and orthogonality. We show that our problem is NP-hard, and we propose a greedy algorithm exploiting the well-known FP-tree data structure. Our algorithm is equipped with strategies for pruning the search space deriving directly from the objective function. We also prove a property that allows assessing the level of informativeness for newly added dimensions, thus allowing to define criteria for terminating the decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets with known dimension and three real-world datasets, flickr, del. icio. us and dblp. The problem we study is largely motivated by applications in the domain of collaborative tagging; however, the mining task we introduce in this paper is useful in other application domains as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging is attracting a growing community in the arts museums as manifested by several initiatives such as the Steve Museum project and the Posse initiative at the Brooklyn Museum. The driving force for these projects is the quest for increased and improved access to artifact collections such as art collections. Previous results of studying the nature of tags provided by users reveal that these tags have little overlap with museum documentation; but on the other hand, there is good overlapping with terms from vocabulary sources such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). This paper reports a case study that we performed where the aim was to include tags provided by "average" users from the broader community, not necessarily closely related to the art field as it was the focus of the previous studies. The study we performed comparing tags generated by average users, expert users and metadata seems to indicate the unique role that tags provided by average users would play in facilitating the interaction with art digital libraries. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Folksonomies have shown to contain information that is beneficial for resource recommendation. However, as folksonomies are not designed to support recommendation tasks, there are drawbacks of the various recommendation techniques. Graphbased recommendation in folksonomies for example suffers from the problem of concept drift. Vector space based recommendation approaches in folksonomies suffer from sparseness of available data. In this paper, we propose the exible framework VSScore which incorporates context-specific information into the recommendation process to tackle these issues. Additionally, as an alternative to the evaluation methodology LeavePostOut we propose an adaptation Leave- RTOut for resource recommendation in folksonomies. In a subset of resource recommendation tasks evaluated, the proposed recommendation framework VSScore performs signifi cantly more effective than the baseline algorithm FolkRank.

Yokie uses the large volume of hyperlink-laden messages on social networks like Twitter as the basis of its content and ranking systems. Curated sets of users (or "Search Parties") form the basis of sourcing the content from the networks, and the metadata of the containing messages form the basis of ranking and contextual retrieval of the hyperlinks. Each hyperlink is indexed with a compound set of terms from multiple tweets (should the given hyperlink be shared more than once). This indexing step is a novel example of collaborative tagging of resources. The application is live with more than 100 users, who have performed approximately 1000 queries.

abstract={With ubiquitous access to Web 2.0 applications, users on social networks can now collaboratively author and share hypermedia learning resources, contributing to more engaging learning experiences in Technology-Enhanced Learning outside formal education. Though these resources are ready to be harnessed for educational purposes, they may or may not be educational or may be suitable for some users only. Hence, it is crucial to annotate these resources to personalize these resources to different user needs. We propose to annotate learning resources with folksonomy-derived description metadata for personalization to context profiles of users. A semantic model for folksonomy was formulated to integrate controlled vocabularies in folksonomy. It not only reduces reliance on domain experts in annotating learning resources but also opens new avenues for more comprehensive resource description, compared to numerical ratings in resource recommendation algorithm. The working principle of the resource annotation and recommendation mechanism is demonstrated via a prototype system implemented in a social network environment. A pilot user study shows that learners are positive about the system in terms of aspects apart from accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Popular Internet document repositories, such as online newspapers, digital libraries, and blogs store large amount of text and image data that are frequently accessed by large number of users. Users' input through collaborative commenting or tagging can be very useful in organizing and classifying documents. Some web sites (e.g. Google Image Labeler) support a collection of tags and labels, but a large fraction of these sites do not currently support such activities. Moreover, relying upon centrally controlled web-service providers for such support is probably not a good idea if the objective is to make the collaborative inputs publicly available. Often, business entities offering such web-based tagging environments end up owning and monetizing the result of the collective effort. This paper takes a step toward addressing this problem-it proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system (PADMINI), powered by distributed data mining algorithms. In particular, it focuses on learning a P2P classifier from tagged text data. This paper describes the PADMINI system and the distributed text classifier learning components; text classification is posed as a linear program and an asynchronous distributed algorithm is used to solve it. It also presents extensive empirical results on text data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proposal abstract database. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

More precisely, we propose a multi-layer framework where data collected by social tagging communities are complemented with additional services. Such services provide users the ability of expressing their dis/agreement with existing tags, denoting the members they trust based on their characteristics and relationships, or specifying policies on which "quality" assessment of resources should be returned. Besides providing the formal specification of the proposed framework, we illustrate two case studies we have implemented and the experiments we have carried out in order to verify the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Collaborative tagging becomes a common feature of current web sites, facilitating ordinary users to annotate and represent online resources. The large collection of tags and their relationships form a tag space. In this kind of tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests. Tags are freely chosen keywords and difficult to organize. As a hierarchical concept structure to represent the subsumption relationships, automatically extracted taxonomies become a viable method to manage collaborative tags. However, tags change over time, and it is also imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the extracted taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large collection of tags. A line of taxonomies are generated to reflect the temporal changes of underlying tag space. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two novel contributions. First, we develop a context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. This method is built on seminal association-rule mining algorithm. Second, we propose several strategies for evolutionary taxonomy fusion, which smooths the newly generated taxonomy with prior ones. We conduct an extensive performance study using a large real-life web page tagging dataset (i. e., Del. ici. ous). The empirical results clearly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Social or collaborative tagging systems emerged as a novel classification scheme on the Web based on the collective knowledge of people. In sites such as Del.icio.us, Technorati or Flickr, users annotate a variety of resources, including Web pages, blogs, pictures, videos or bibliographic references; using freely chosen textual labels or tags. Underlying collaborative tagging systems are ternary data structures known as folksonomies relating resources and users through tags, this information facilitate accessing and browsing massive repositories of resources. Collective annotations provided by people in the form of tags can also be exploited to organize resources on-line in a more formal classification scheme such as the ones provided by hierarchies or directories, alleviating the task of manual classification commonly required by systems like directories on the Web. In this paper we present an empirical study carried out to determine the value of tags in resource classification. Furthermore, the use of several filtering and pre-processing operations to reduce the ambiguity and noise in tags are analyzed to determine whether they allow to increase the quality of resource classification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this manuscript we present a method that leverages social media for the effortless learning of object detectors. We are motivated by the fact that the increased training cost of methods demanding manual annotation, limits their ability to easily scale in different types of objects and domains. At the same time, the rapidly growing social media applications have made available a tremendous volume of tagged images, which could serve as a solution for this problem. However, the nature of annotations (i.e. global level) and the noise existing in the associated information (due to lack of structure, ambiguity, redundancy, and emotional tagging), prevents them from being readily compatible (i.e. accurate region level annotations) with the existing methods for training object detectors. We present a novel approach to overcome this deficiency using the collective knowledge aggregated in social sites to automatically determine a set of image regions that can be associated with a certain object. We study theoretically and experimentally when the prevailing trends (in terms of appearance frequency) in visual and tag information space converge into the same object, and how this convergence is influenced by the number of utilized images and the accuracy of the visual analysis algorithms. Evaluation results show that although the models trained using leveraged social media are inferior to the ones trained manually, there are cases where the user contributed content can be successfully used to facilitate scalable and effortless learning of object detectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We use this methodology for evaluating how tag recommendations coming from (1) the popular tags at a resource or from (2) the user's own vocabulary influence the indexing quality. We show that recommending popular tags decreases the indexing quality and that recommending the user's own vocabulary increases the indexing quality. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Therefore, the techniques used in traditional information retrieval systems do not meet the requirements of users who want to take into account their social preferences. The idea reported in this paper is about including not only the social context of the user but also the one for the resource. In the social network that we consider, the user social context brings its interests, which are captured from a collaborative tagging system, while the resource social context is related to clusters of tags, obtained by classification method, and users' opinions according to their expertise level on the resource. The results of our experiment evaluation on real-world datasets (crawled from delicious folksonomy) demonstrate significant improvements over traditional retrieval approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

In order to analyze and compare these initiatives we present here an abstract framework. It supports our argument that existing approaches do not explore the full potential of the combination between folksonomies and ontologies due to their unidirectionality. The framework is also the basis to evidence that a fusion approach - -as proposed in our "folksonomized ontology" - -enables to better explore the organic semantics of folksonomies combined to the engineered semantics of ontologies. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging platforms allow users to describe resources with freely chosen keywords, so called tags. The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract={We demonstrate the Taagle system for top-k retrieval in social tagging systems (also known as folksonomies). The general setting is the following: users form a weighted social network, which may reflect friendship, similarity, or trust; items from a public pool of items (e.g., URLs, blogs, photos, documents) are tagged by users with keywords; users search for the top-k items having certain tags. Going beyond a classic search paradigm where data is decoupled from the users querying it, users can now act both as producers and seekers of information. Hence finding the most relevant items in response to a query should be done in a network-aware manner: items tagged by users who are closer (more similar) to the seeker should be given more weight than items tagged by distant users. We illustrate with Taagle novel algorithms and a general approach that has the potential to scale to current applications, in an online context where the social network, the tagging data and even the seekers' search ingredients can change at any moment. We also illustrate possible design choices for providing users a fully-personalized and customizable search interface. By this interface, they can calibrate how social proximity is computed (for example, with respect to similarity in tagging actions), how much weight the social score of tagging actions should have in the result build-up, or the criteria by which the user network should be explored. In order to further reduce running time, seekers are given the possibility to chose between exact or approximate answers, and can benefit from cached results of previous queries (materialized views). © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. In this paper an intelligent tag recommendation agent is proposed, that recommends tags for bookmarks stored in one of the popular social bookmarking websites, Del.ici.ou.1 We develop various probabilistic approaches to recommend tags to be used by users while adding new bookmarks. We have developed content-based and collaborative filtering mechanism that are used by these recommendation agents. Additionally, these tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. This approach can therefore be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for social networks. We also empirically verify the hypothesis that similar web pages are tagged with similar tags. We also present a comparison between the proposed recommendation approaches for the agents. © 2012 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Due to the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, the research on tagged networks, hypergraphs, ontologies, folksonomies and other related concepts is becoming an important interdisciplinary area with great potential and relevance for practical applications. In most collaborative tagging systems the tagging by the users is completely 'flat', while in some cases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags. However, usually no overall hierarchical organization of the tags is given, and one of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm generating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there are also other types of tagged networks available for research, where the tags are already organized into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the 'is a sub-category of' type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper, we study how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes marked by the tags in various real networks. The motivation for this research was the fact that understanding the tagging based on a known hierarchy can help in revealing the hidden hierarchy of tags in collaborative tagging systems.We analyse the relation between the tagfrequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large sub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction network. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a two-dimensional (2D) tag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the absolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most interesting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG (i.e. their rank or significance as characterized by, e.g., the length of the branches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance from the root. Furthermore, we also introduce a simple tagging model based on random walks on the DAG, capable of reproducing the main statistical features of tag co-occurrence. This model has high potential for further practical applications, e.g., it can provide the starting point for a benchmark system in ontology retrieval or it may help pinpoint unusual correlations in the co-occurrence of tags. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging have emerged as a ubiquitous way to annotate and organize online resources. As a kind of descriptive keyword, large amount of tags are created and associated to multiple types of resources, e. g., web pages, photos, videos and tweets. Users' tagging actions over time reflect their changing interests. Monitoring and analyzing the temporal patterns of tags can provide important insights to trace hot topics on the web. Existing work focuses on deriving temporal patterns for individual tags. However, there exist remarkable correlations among tags assigned to online resources. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect bursty tagging event, which captures the relations among a group of correlated tags where the tags are either bursty or associated with bursty tag co-occurrence. This kind of bursty tagging event generally corresponds to a real life event. It profiles the events with more representative and comprehensible clues. The proposed approach is divided into three stages. We exploit the sliding time intervals to extract bursty features as the first step, and then adopt graph clustering techniques to group bursty features into meaningful bursty events. We discuss the choice of similarity and granularity for event detection. After that, we further utilize an automatically generated tag taxonomy to organize bursty events to facilitate the burst oriented navigation and analysis. The experimental study on a large real data set demonstrates the superiority of our new approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Recommender Systems are non-profit websites to predict user preferences. In Commercial websites predicting accurate data may result higher selling rates.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommender systems. These methods are based on collecting and analyzing the information of a particular user behavior, activity, preferences and will predict the user's interest according to the similarity of other users. In this paper we address the problem of scalability associated with CF and propose a CF framework that combines collaborative tagging with genre interestingness measure for a movie RS. Our experiments on each movie dataset with recent timestamp demonstrate that the proposed CFT -GIM gives more accurate predictions of user's ratings as compared to both CF and CFT.},

abstract={We propose a semantic collaborative filtering method to enhance recommendation quality derived from user-generated tags. Social tagging is employed as an approach in order to grasp and filter users' preferences for items. In addition, we explore several advantages of semantic tagging for ambiguity, synonymy, and semantic interoperability, which are notable challenges in information filtering. The proposed approach first determines semantically similar users using social tagging and subsequently discovers semantically relevant items for each user. Experimental results show that our method offers significant advantages both in terms of improving the recommendation quality and in dealing with ambiguity, synonymy, and interoperability issues. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Turning Web services into Semantic Web Services (SWS) can be prohibitively expensive for large repositories. In such cases collecting community descriptions in forms of structured tags can be a more affordable approach to describe Web services. However, little is understood about how tagging impacts performance of retrieval. There are neither real structured tagging systems for Web services, nor real corpora of structured tags. To start addressing these issues, in our approach, we motivated taggers to tag services in a partially controlled environment. Specifically, taggers were given application requirements and asked to find and tag services that match the requirements. Tags collected in this way were used for Web service matchmaking and evaluated within the framework of the Cross-Evaluation Track of the Third Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest. As part of the lessons learned, we explain relations between description schema (SWS, tags, flat document) and matchmaking heuristics, and performance of retrieval in different search scenarios. We also analyze reliability of tagging system performance as related to taggers/searchers autonomy. Finally, we identify threats to results credibility stemming from partial control of the tags collection process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={The cross-sections of the Social Web and the Semantic Web has put folksonomy in the spot light for its potential in overcoming knowledge acquisition bottleneck and providing insight for "wisdom of the crowds". Folksonomy which comes as the results of collaborative tagging activities has provided insight into user's understanding about Web resources which might be useful for searching and organizing purposes. However, collaborative tagging vocabulary poses some challenges since tags are freely chosen by users and may exhibit synonymy and polysemy problem. In order to overcome these challenges and boost the potential of folksonomy as emergence semantics we propose to consolidate the diverse vocabulary into a consolidated entities and concepts. We propose to extract a tag ontology by ontology learning process to represent the semantics of a tagging community. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. We provide empirical evaluations by using the semantic information contained in the ontology in a tag recommendation experiment. The results show that by using the semantic relationships on the ontology the accuracy of the tag recommender has been improved. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

abstract={In recent years, there is a fast proliferation of collaborative tagging (a.k.a. folksonomy) systems in Web 2.0 communities. With the increasingly large amount of data, how to assist users in searching their interested resources by utilizing these semantic tags becomes a crucial problem. Collaborative tagging systems provide an environment for users to annotate resources, and most users give annotations according to their perspectives or feelings. However, users may have different perspectives or feelings on resources, e.g., some of them may share similar perspectives yet have a conflict with others. Thus, modeling the profile of a resource based on tags given by all users who have annotated the resource is neither suitable nor reasonable. We propose, to tackle this problem in this paper, a community-aware approach to constructing resource profiles via social filtering. In order to discover user communities, three different strategies are devised and discussed. Moreover, we present a personalized search approach by combining a switching fusion method and a revised needs-relevance function, to optimize personalized resources ranking based on user preferences and user issued query. We conduct experiments on a collected real life dataset by comparing the performance of our proposed approach and baseline methods. The experimental results verify our observations and effectiveness of proposed method. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

Libraries and other information environments hope that tagging can complement professional subject access with user-created terms. But who are the taggers, and does their language represent that of the user population? Some language theorists believe that inherent variables, such as gender or race, can be responsible for language use, whereas other researchers endorse more multiply-influenced practice-based approaches, where interactions with others affect language use more than a single variable. To explore whether linguistic variation in tagging is influenced more by gender or context, in this exploratory study, I will analyze the content and quantity of tags used on LibraryThing.

abstract={When large groups work on a theme, they have the potential to produce a lot of useful knowledge, regardless of whether they are acting in a coordinated manner or individually. Spontaneously generated information has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. New technologies, such as blogs, Twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, enable the creation and dissemination of content in a relatively simple way. As a result, the aggregate body of knowledge is growing at an accelerated rate. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Research has shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. Research has shown that individuals respond quickly and massively to emergencies, and that they try to help with the situation. Thus, it seems like a logical step to attempt to harness collective knowledge for emergency management. Disaster relief groups and field command frequently suffer from lack of up to date information, which may be critical in a rapidly evolving situation. Some of this information could be generated by the crowd at large, enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for the introduction of collective knowledge in disaster relief and present architecture and examples of how this could be accomplished. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As the collaborative tagging systems such as Delicious, Flickr and Last.fm become more and more popular, a large amount of resources produced by publishers, together with rich semantic metadata, become available. There are lots of ways to make use of tag information and so far the most discussed usage is for searching. The distribution of tag types differs greatly across different systems. Also the distribution shows large difference between publishers and searchers. In order to expand tags of resources for publishers and keywords for searchers reasonable, this paper shows a comparison of the distributions of both kinds of users and proposes an approach which could calculate the recommendation level of types. The level of types could be used to describe whether the type is valuable to the corresponding users. The distribution of different combination of types has also been investigated, and with such information we analysed the most popular combination of types in query log across different collections. We compare the searching accuracy on original datasets against the datasets with resources after being expanded tags by our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our method could improve searching accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Information representation in engineering design is currently dominated by top-down approaches such as taxonomies and ontologies. While top-down approaches provide support for computational reasoning, they are primarily limited due to their static nature, limited scope, and developer-centric focus. Bottom-up approaches, such as folksonomies, are emerging as means to address the limitations of top-down approaches. Folksonomies refer to collaborative classification by users who freely assign tags to design information. They are dynamic in nature, broad in scope, and are user focused. However, they are limited due to the presence of ambiguities and redundancies in the tags used by different people. Considering their complementary nature, the ideal approach is to use both top-down and bottom-up approaches in a synergistic manner. To facilitate this synergy, the goal in this paper is to present techniques for using dynamic folksonomies to extract global characteristics of the structure of design information, and to create hierarchies of tags that can guide the development of structured taxonomies and ontologies. The approach presented in this paper involves using (a) tools such as degree distribution and K-neighborhood connectivity analysis to extract the global characteristics of folksonomies and (b) set-based technique and hierarchical clustering to develop a hierarchy of tags. The approach is illustrated using data from a collective innovation platform that supports collaborative tagging for design information. It is shown that despite the flat nature of the folksonomies insights about the hierarchy in information can be gained. The effects of various parameters on the tag hierarchy are discussed. The approach has potential to be used synergistically with top-down approaches such as ontologies to support the next generation collaborative design platforms. © 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

However, how to help users conduct high quality resource retrieval remains a challenge and should be considered first for an e-learning system. The traditional indexing approach which classifies multimedia resources into predefined categories can hardly meet user demands.

Moreover, feedbacks made by users can be utilized to refine the retrieval results during the interactive process between users and systems.

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tagabstrcatsness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of wordabstrcatness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and Wikitaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data.},

abstract={We introduce the problem of diverse dimension decomposition in transactional databases. A dimension is a set of mutually-exclusive itemsets, and our problem is to find a decomposition of the itemset space into dimensions, which are orthogonal to each other, and that provide high coverage of the input database. The mining framework we propose effectively represents a dimensionality-reducing transformation from the space of all items to the space of orthogonal dimensions. Our approach relies on information-theoretic concepts, and we are able to formulate the dimension-finding problem with a single objective function that simultaneously captures constraints on coverage, exclusivity and orthogonality. We describe an efficient greedy method for finding diverse dimensions from transactional databases. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using two real datasets, flickr and del.icio.us, demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution. Although we are motivated by the applications in the collaborative tagging domain, we believe that the mining task we introduce in this paper is general enough to be useful in other application domains. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the popularity of collaborative tagging services and systems, the role of social tags in information organization and retrieval has become increasingly critical within the tagging system. Consequently, the resolution of semantic ambiguity of tag sense (i.e., meaning) plays an important role in the enhancement of information organization and retrieval in collaborative tagging applications. Our approach to tackle the task of automatic resolution of semantic ambiguity is based on the hypothesis that given a target tag, some of the co-occurring social tags that were selectively assigned by the same or by different people to the same resource can serve as a useful dataset. Four different methods (i.e., two LSA-based, LIN-based, and Cooccurrence method) for tag sense disambiguation are proposed and their results are compared, aiming to automatically rank the senses associated with a given target tag. The experimental results with a Delicious dataset indicate that LSA-w and LIN-based methods produce more stable performances, and suggest the same two methods for the Tag Sense Disambiguation task, particularly in the situation that the Boolean effect is more likely to arise.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging services provided by various social web sites become popular means to mark web resources for different purposes such as categorization, expression of a preference and so on. However, the tags are of syntactic nature, in a free style and do not reflect semantics, resulting in the problems of redundancy, ambiguity and less semantics. Current tag-based recommender systems mainly take the explicit structural information among users, resources and tags into consideration, while neglecting the important implicit semantic relationships hidden in tagging data. In this study, we propose a Semantic Enhancement Recommendation strategy (SemRec), based on both structural information and semantic information through a unified fusion model.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation systems generally model user behavior as research has shown that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling users' preferences. However, these preferences are usually treated as constant over time, neglecting the temporal factor within users' interests. On the other hand, little is known about how this factor may influence prediction in social bookmarking systems. In this paper, we investigate the temporal dynamics of user interests in tagging systems and propose a user-tag-specific temporal interests model for tracking users' interests over time. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of topic switches in social bookmarking systems, showing that a temporal interests model can benefit from the integration of topic switch detection and that temporal characteristics of social tagging systems are different from traditional concept drift problems. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, demonstrating the importance of personalization and user-tag specialization in tagging systems. Experimental results show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art tag prediction algorithms. We also incorporate our model within existing content-based methods yielding significant improvements in performance. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

abstract={Collaborative tagging or social bookmarking is a main component of Web 2.0 systems and has been widely recognized as one of the key technologies underpinning next-generation knowledge management platforms. In this article, we propose a subject-centered model of collaborative tagging to account for the ternary cooccurrences involving users, items, and tags in such systems. Extending the well-established probabilistic latent semantic analysis theory for knowledge representation, our model maps the user, item, and tag entities into a common latent subject space that captures the "wisdom of the crowd" resulted from the collaborative tagging process. To put this model into action, we have developed a novel way to estimate the probabilistic subject- centeredmodel approximately in a highly efficient manner taking advantage of amatrix factorization method. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed approach delivers substantial performance improvement on the knowledge resource recommendation task over the state-of-the-art standard and tag-aware resource recommendation algorithms. © 2011 ACM.},

A set of descriptive tags has to be manually entered by users whenever they post a resource. This process can be simplified by the use of tag recommendation systems. Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been widely adopted by social media websites to allow users to describe content with metadata tags. Tagging can greatly improve search results. We propose a cross-language social media retrieval system (CLSMR) to help users retrieve foreign-language tagged media content. We construct a Chinese to Korean CLSMR system that translates Chinese queries into Korean, retrieves content, and then translates the Korean tags in the search results back into Chinese. Our system translates NEs using a dictionary of bilingual NE pairs from Wikipedia and a pattern-based software translator which learns regular NE patterns from the web. The top-10 precision of YouTube retrieved results for our system was 0.39875. The K-C NE tag translation accuracy for the top-10 YouTube results was 77.6%, which shows that our translation method is fairly effective for named entities. A questionnaire given to users showed that automatically translated tags were considered as informative as a human-written summary. With our proposed CLSMR system, Chinese users can retrieve online Korean media files and get a basic understanding of their content with no knowledge of the Korean language. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites has created new challenges and opportunities for designers of web items, such as electronics products, travel itineraries, popular blogs, etc. An increasing number of people are turning to online reviews and user-specified tags to choose from among competing items. This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={The 'Collaborative Tagging' is gaining popularity on Web 2.0, this new generation of Web which makes user reader/writer. The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

This forms a quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings. Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

abstract={Video summarisation is one of the most active fields in content-based video retrieval research. A new video summarisation scheme is proposed by this paper based on socially generated temporal tags. To capture users' collaborative tagging activities the proposed scheme maintains video bookmarks, which contain some temporal or positional information about videos, such as relative time codes or byte offsets. For each video all the video bookmarks collected from users are then statistically analysed in order to extract some meaningful key frames (the video equivalent of keywords), which collectively constitute the summary of the video. Compared with traditional video summarisation methods that use low-level audio-visual features, the proposed method is based on users' high-level collaborative activities, and thus can produce semantically more important summaries than existing methods. It is assumed that the video frames around the bookmarks inserted by users are informative and representative, and therefore can be used as good sources for summarising videos. Folksonomy, commonly called collaborative tagging, is a Web 2.0 method for users to freely annotate shared information resources with keywords. It has mostly been used for collaboratively tagging photos (Flickr), web site bookmarks (Del.icio.us), or blog posts (Technorati), but has never been applied to the field of automatic video summarisation. It is believed that this is the first attempt to utilise users' high-level collaborative tagging activities, instead of low-level audio-visual features, for video summarisation. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={In this article, we discuss the notions of experts and expertise in resource discovery in the context of collaborative tagging systems. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. First, an expert should possess a high-quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource in turn depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it, forming a mutual reinforcement relationship. Second, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users discover them, thus bringing these resources to the attention of the community of users. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (spamming-resistant expertise analysis and ranking), which implements the above ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. Our experiments show that our assumptions on expertise in resource discovery, and SPEAR as an implementation of these ideas, allow us to promote experts and demote spammers at the same time, with performance significantly better than the original hypertext-induced topic search algorithm and simple statistical measures currently used in most collaborative tagging systems. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a distributed systems and Web Services Architecture that supports a content management and collaborative tagging system for a Webbased cultural heritage site. The site uses Formal Concept Analysis to infer semantic associations between objects and drive the navigation of its collection, and we promote an extension of its capability by rendering such functionality via Web Services. The Web Services architecture supports a system called the Virtual Museum of the Pacific - a content and knowledge acquisition tool that permits the machine synthesis of formal concepts and provides a Rich Internet Application in which to display and navigate them. The Web Services also permit the extensible association of digital objects by inducing new attributes and relationships from museum meta-data, and allows for the ability for users and stakeholders to upload, annotate and attach rich media, YouTube or Vimeo links, and voice narratives to the objects. By rendering these capabilities as an open API, we encourage a connected and open approach to the sharing of cultural heritage and provide platform for further research and development - making our application well suited for mobile devices, Web-based mashups, and data exchange between collection databases. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated how the widespread adoption of collaborative tagging systems yields emergent semantics. In recent years, much has been learned about how to harvest the data produced by taggers for engineering light-weight ontologies. For example, existing measures of tag similarity and tag relatedness have proven crucial step stones for making latent semantic relations in tagging systems explicit. However, little progress has been made on other issues, such as understanding the different levels of tag generality (or tag abstractness), which is essential for, among others, identifying hierarchical relationships between concepts. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Starting from a review of linguistic definitions of word abstractness, we first use several large-scale ontologies and taxonomies as grounded measures of word generality, including Yago, Wordnet, DMOZ and WikiTaxonomy. Then, we introduce and apply several folksonomy-based methods to measure the level of generality of given tags. We evaluate these methods by comparing them with the grounded measures. Our results suggest that the generality of tags in social tagging systems can be approximated with simple measures. Our work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including search, tag recommendation, and the acquisition of light-weight ontologies from tagging data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

By leveraging social tagging, we propose a new personalized search method to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also retrieval coverage. Our approach first determines the similarities between resources and between tags. Thereafter, we build two models: a user-tag relation model that reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and a tag-item relation model that captures how a certain tag has been tagged to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly map the tags on the items depending on a particular user's query in order to find the most attractive media content relevant to the user needs. The experimental evaluations have shown the proposed method achieves better search results than state-of-the art algorithms in terms of accuracy and coverage. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably, the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the noise. Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with three-mode tensors, in order to capture the three-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multiway analysis, latent correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Moreover, a hybrid scheme is proposed that additionally considers content-based information that is extracted from items. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Last.fm), against both recent tag-aware and traditional (non tag aware) item recommendation algorithms indicates significant improvements in recommendation quality. Moreover, the experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed hybrid scheme. © 2011 IEEE.},

The results of the study show that tags enhance individuals' ability to remember the viewed meals.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is the practice of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize online content. Current collaborative tagging activities within medical blogs are done using free words chosen by users. These tags are not based on standard medical terminologies. The resulted tags are inefficient in terms of medical meanings and semantic interlinking capabilities. In this paper, MTag is presented as a new model for collaborative tagging in medical blogs, i.e. tagging blog entries with medical information. MTag includes two modules: the service module and the semantic module. The service module enables health professionals provide blog posts with auto-completed tags that represent actual medical terms and categorize their tags. Tags are mapped to URIs from online medical knowledge datasets to clarify their medical meaning. At the same time, the semantic module is equipped with a tag ontology which extends the Social Semantic Cloud of Tags (SCOT) ontology to consent medical specifications of tags. Eventually, a prototype is developed to test the MTag's two modules. The results show that both modules are working properly. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Folksonomy and tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. The concepts are organized as a map in human mind, however, the tags in folksonomy, which reflect users' collaborative cognition on information, are isolated with current approach. What we do in this paper is to estimate the semantic relatedness among tags in folksonomy: whether tags are related from semantic view, rather than isolated? We introduce different algorithms to form networks of folksonomy, connecting tags by users collaborative tagging, or by resource context. Then we perform multiple measures of semantic relatedness on folksonomy networks to investigate semantic information within them. The result shows that the connections between tags have relatively strong semantic relatedness, and the relatedness decreases dramatically as the distance between tags increases. What we find in this paper could provide useful visions in designing future folksonomy-based systems, constructing semantic web in current state of the Internet, and developing natural language processing applications.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have recently become very popular as a method of categorising information online and have been used to annotate a wide range of different resources. In such systems users are free to choose whatever keywords or "tags" they wish to annotate each resource, resulting in a highly personalised, unrestricted vocabulary. While this freedom of choice has several notable advantages, it does come at the cost of making searching of these systems more difficult as the vocabulary problem introduced is more pronounced than in a normal information retrieval setting. In this paper we propose to use hidden topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of this data to provide more accurate resource rankings with higher recall. We first describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a simple topic model and then introduce 2 extended models which can be used to personalise the results by including information about the user who made each annotation. We test these 3 models and compare them with 3 non-topic model baselines on a large data sample obtained from the Delicious social bookmarking site. Our evaluations show that our methods significantly outperform all of the baselines with the personalised models also improving significantly upon unpersonalised LDA. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={This paper introduces a folksonomy-based recommendation system for the worldwide Sensor Web which aims to aid users to deal with the terabytes of data that are generated by the sensors. We demonstrate how folksonomies could be adopted for the Sensor Web and other geospatial applications dealing with large volumes of data, by exploiting the geospatial information associated with three key components of such collaborative tagging systems: tags, resources and users. We propose algorithms for: i) suggesting tags for users during the tag input stage; ii) generating tag maps which provides for serendipitous browsing; and iii) personalized searching within the folksonomy. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms using an existing large dataset. An implementation of the folksonomy for the emerging Sensor Web platform is also presented. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the development of Web collection recommendation algorithms surrender quality to the huge and sparse dataset. A memory-based collaborative filtering method increases computational complexity. Obviously sparsity and expensive complexity of computation are trade-offs. In order to settle this problem we propose an improved recommendation algorithm based on collaborative tagging called personalized filtering (PF). PF defines and weighs the feature of tags using 4-D dataset, which can show latent personal interests and long-term personal interests. To decrease the computational complexity, PF constructs a top-N tags set to filter out the undersized dataset. To track the changes of personal interests, PF proposed a novel interest changing algorithm on the 4-D dataset. Some empirical experiments were done and the results shown that the sparsity level of PF is much lower and the computing speed is faster than traditional algorithms. © 2011 NSP.},

abstract={One of the key requirements for the success of Service Oriented Architecture is discoverability of Web services. However, public services suffer from the lack of metadata. Current methods to provide such metadata are impractical for the volume of services published on the Web: they are too expensive to be implemented by a service broker, and too difficult to be used for retrieval. We introduce structured collaborative tagging to address these issues. Here, user tags not only aspects relevant for her but also suggested ones (input, output and behavior). Cost, performance and usability of the proposed technique obtained during the Semantic Service Selection 2009 contest are reported. Obtained results suggests that there is no "free lunch." While the method is user-friendly and supports effective retrieval, it still involves cost of attracting the community, and is practical only as complementary one. The analysis shows this is due to user's autonomy as to what, when and how to tag. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has emerged as a mechanism to describe items in large on-line collections. Tags are assigned by users to describe and find back items, but it is also tempting to describe the users in terms of the tags they assign or in terms of the tags of the items they are interested in. The tag-based profile thus obtained can be used to recommend new items. If we recommend new items by computing their similarity to the user profile or to all items seen by the user, we run into the risk of recommending only neutral items that are a bit relevant for each topic a user is interested in. In order to increase user satisfaction many recommender systems not only optimize for accuracy but also for diversity. Often it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between accuracy and diversity. In this paper we introduce topic aware recommendation algorithms. Topic aware algorithms first detect different interests in the user profile and then generate recommendations for each of these interests. We study topic aware variants of three tag based recommendation algorithms and show that each of them gives better recommendations than their base variants, both in terms of precision and recall and in terms of diversity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

abstract={The informal setting of learning at work give rise for unique challenges to the field of technology enhanced learning systems. Personalized recommendations taking into account the current context of the individual knowledge worker are a powerful approach to overcome those challenges and effectively support the knowledge workers to meet their individual information needs. Basis for these recommendations to adopt to the current context of a knowledge worker can be provided by user models which reflects the topics knowledge workers are dealing with and their corresponding knowledge levels, but research has only focused on user modeling in settings with a static underlying domain model so far. We suggest to model the users' context based on the emergent topics they are dealing with and their individual current knowledge levels within these topics by extracting the necessary information from the user's past activities within the system. Based on data from an experiment with students learning a new topic with the help of a collaborative tagging system, we started to evaluate this approach and report on first results.},

We propose a model that allows tagging as well as establishing relations between any pair of resources, not just objects and tags. Moreover, we propose to use this extension to enrich and facilitate the process of building semantic knowledge representations.

Specifically, in the following, the users' social connections in consideration were groups. Unlike other studies which utilized groups inferred by data mining technologies, we used the information about the groups in which each user explicitly participated. The group activities are centered on common interests. People join a group to share and acquire information about a topic as a form of community of interest or practice. The information of this group activity may be a good source of information for the members. We tested whether adding the information from the users' own groups or group members to the traditional CF-based recommendations can improve the recommendation quality or not. The information about groups was combined with CF using a mixed hybridization strategy. We evaluated our approach in two ways, using the Citeulike data set and a real user study.

abstract={The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

abstract={This research work presents a folksonomic annotation used in a collaborative tagging system to enhance the Web service discovery process. More expressive than traditional tags, this structural tagging method is able to reflect the functional capability of Web services, easy to use and very much accessible to users than ontology or logic based formalism of annotation. We describe a Web service retrieval system exploiting the aforementioned structural tagging. System user profiling is also approached in order to further assign reputation and compute tag recommendation. We present some interesting usage scenarios of this system and also a strategy to evaluate its performance.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems (CTS) enable Internet users to annotate for resources using custom tags, and the tags reflect the user interest and thus form a user profile. However, the flexibility of tagging brings large number of synonymous and polysemous tags which make the use of these profile information to personalize resource recommendation difficult. We propose to use graph-based clustering to form groups of semantically-related tags in the offline stage. Then in the online stage the tag clusters act as an intermediary between users and resource and are utilized to personalize the query results in CTS. 5-fold cross-validation is performed on two data sets, the results are compared with two other algorithms. Results show that the algorithm proposed demonstrate much better personalization measured by the F-value, whilst the effect is more miraculous in a multi-topic than in a single-topic CTS. This observation suggests that in a multi-topic CTS tag clustering such as proposed in this paper is an important strategy. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Social resource sharing systems are central elements of the Web 2.0 and use the same kind of lightweight knowledge representation, called folksonomy. Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of user-generated content have made them an attractive object of investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Results indicate a steady decrease in the number of unique tags over the four years, suggesting an increasing stability in the community vocabulary over time and the establishment of domain-specific vocabulary. Members reused each others' tags over time and exhibited increasingly collaborative tagging behaviour. Tag discrimination was high, with 4.11 distinct articles per tag. The stable and discriminatory nature of the community's tags suggests that collaborative tagging may serve as a useful resource for vocabulary choice or maintenance by KMS managers. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy [11]) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in a collaborative tagging environment.

We examine data on tagging practices from the Delicious web site (delicious.com) and find that there is little support for any of these beliefs. Although users individually do seem to have a small set of tags that they use in a controlled and effective way, they also use very large sets of other tags in a much more haphazard way. These poorly managed tags obscure much of the collective sense making and implicit community structure. We derive some suggestions for improving collaborative tagging systems.

abstract={Collaboration and information sharing among government organizations is becoming increasingly important for promoting efficiency and productivity as well as for enhancing citizen services. With Internet connectivity widely available and with the ease-of-use of social media tools, citizens actively participate in producing content. However, the abundance of content causes another problem for governments-the difficulty of determining what truly useful and relevant information is to be shared for mission critical tasks and to produce better citizen services. Information resources, such as data, documents, multimedia objects and services stored in different agencies and produced by citizens need to be easily discovered and shared. We propose a data model of rich social tags and a Citizen-Government collaborative tagging environment} where governments and citizens can collaboratively annotate the resources, thus facilitating collaboration responsiveness through accessibility to information. The collaborative annotations capture not only the semantics but also the pragmatic and social aspects related to the resources, such as who, when, where, how and for what related tasks the resources are shared. The benefits of the a rich tag data model emphasizing the relationships of a tag to semantic, social, pragmatic and contextual reference frames include the ability to filter, discover and search new and dynamic as well as hidden resources, to navigate between resources in a search by traversing semantic relationships, and to recommend the most relevant government information even when distributed over different agencies. A distributed architecture of a government collaborative tagging system is proposed and tag-based search and recommendations are illustrated. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.},

We report results of an experimental study in which we examined the interaction between individual expertise and the basic level advantage in collaborative tagging. The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

abstract={The content of collaborative tagging systems (so-called folksonomies) is generated, consumed, and annotated by the endusers. Users annotate and categorise their data using free-keywords, so-called tags. Consequently, several linguistic problems come to the surface in folksonomies such as; synonyms, polysemy, multilinguality, and others which produce ambiguous and inconsistent classification of data. Therefore, relevant results are not retrieved in the user's query. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to enhance the "social vocabulary" presented in folksonomies with the "controlled vocabulary" presented in Semantic Web ontologies. Therefore, our proposed approach uses the online WordNet lexical ontology in addition to the EuroWordNet multilingual lexical resource. Our approach tries to employ the ontological relations presented in WordNet in the folksonomy, it focuses only on the problems of synonyms, tag relations, and multilinguality.},

abstract={Along with the new opportunities introduced by Web 2.0 and collaborative tagging systems, several challenges have to be addressed too, notably the problem of information overload. Recommender systems are among the most successful approaches for increasing the level of relevant content over the "noise". Traditional recommender systems fail to address the requirements presented in collaborative tagging systems. This paper considers the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging systems. It is proposed to model data from collaborative tagging systems with 3-mode tensors, in order to capture the 3-way correlations between users, tags, and items. By applying multi-way analysis, latent semantic correlations are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. Nevertheless, high-order tensors tend be sparse, a fact that hinders the application of multi-way analysis. To address this problem, we propose the application of kernel-based methods, which act as smoothing functions against sparsity. Experimental comparison, using data from a real collaborative tagging system (Bibsonomy), indicates the superiority of the proposed method against the non kernel-based method and also against other baseline methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

It has been argued that the power of tagging lies in the ability for people to freely determine the appropriate tags for resources without having to rely on a predefined lexicon or hierarchy. The freeform nature of tagging causes a number of problems in this social classification scheme, such as synonymy and morphological variety. However, social tagging can be a valuable source of information to help in the organization of Web resources. In this paper we present an empirical analysis carried out to determine the importance of social tagging in Web page classification.

In a tag space, the popularity and correlation amongst tags capture the current social interests, and taxonomy is a useful way to organize these tags. As tags change over time, it is imperative to incorporate the temporal tag evolution into the taxonomies. In this paper, we formalize the problem of evolutionary taxonomy generation over a large database of tags. The proposed evolutionary taxonomy framework consists of two key features. Firstly, we develop a novel context-aware edge selection algorithm for taxonomy extraction. Secondly, we propose several algorithms for evolutionary taxonomy fusion. We conduct an extensive performance study using a very large real-life dataset (i.e., Del.ici.ous). The empirical results clearly show that our approach is effective and efficient. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper approaches the problem by applying a combined set of techniques and tools (that uses tags, domain ontologies, keyphrase extraction methods) thereby generating tags automatically. The proposed approach is implemented in the PIRATES (Personalized Intelligent tag Recommender and Annotator TEStbed) framework, a prototype system for personalized content retrieval, annotation, and classification. A case study application is developed using a domain ontology for software engineering. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications or folksonomies allow internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. However, freedom afforded users come at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag ambiguity hindering navigation. Ambiguity can mislead users as they search for relevant resources. Recommenders that avoid ambiguous tags may be penalized by standard utility metrics for not promoting such tags. To provide effectiveness of tag recommendation in term of accuracy and coverage, we propose a new method for tag recommendation approach based on social semantic web to overcome ambiguity and presenting users tags and resources that correspond more closely. This method is a combination of semantic content analysis methods and social network analysis methods. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Similarly, in tagging systems like Delicious or Flickr people share tagged resources with friends or unknown, similar users. Offline social networks have long been studied in sociology, epidemiology, etc. However, the new online networks offer new ways to revisit old theories as well as to find emerging trends with respect to information diffusion and sharing in the Web 2.0. The goal is to explore and exploit relational ties in a way to enable the mining of useful knowledge and effective information propagation/diffusion. Assuming no or only potential ties explicitly given, the focus is first on the analysis of collaborative tagging and its potentials for user profiling, recommendations and search. Some first related studies, approaches and ideas for future work address the identification and exploitation of weak and strong ties in online networks.},

abstract={Collective Intelligence has received much attention in recent years, as organizations and businesses discover the power of crowds. With new technologies, such as blogs, twitter, wikis, photo sharing, collaborative tagging and social networking sites, people may create and disseminate content as never before. Many organizations are looking for ways to harness this power, which is being called collective intelligence. Additionally, many open-source initiatives have shown that it is possible to obtain high quality results from collectively produced work. In this paper, we consider the domain of emergency response. We have been working in this domain for a few years now, mostly focusing on small disaster relief groups and field command. One of the command problems is lack of information about the location where the disaster occurred. We believe some of this information could be crowdsourced, changing current practices and enabling more effective response to the situation. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities for crowdsourcing and present an initial proposal for harnessing collective intelligence for the fire department. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, such as Delicious, CiteULike, and others, allow users to annotate resources, for example, Web pages or scientific papers, with descriptive labels called tags. The social annotations contributed by thousands of users can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify documents, or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference methods do not make the best use of social annotation, since they do not take into account variations in individual users' perspectives and vocabulary. In a previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes the interests of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming: the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics of Web resources from social annotations obtained from Delicious in order to discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social knowledge contained in user-generated annotations. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing popularity of Social Media sites, a lot of user generated content has been injected in the Web, thus resulting in a large amount of both multimedia items (music - Last.fm, MySpace.com, pictures - Flickr, Picasa, videos - YouTube) and textual data (tags and other text-based documents). As a consequence, especially for multimedia content it has become more and more difficult to find exactly the objects that best match the users' information needs. The methods we propose in this paper try to alleviate this problem and we focus on the domain of pictures, in particular on a subset of Flickr data. Many of the photos posted by users on Flickr have been shot during events and our methods aim to allow browsing and organization of picture collections in a natural way, by events. The algorithms we introduce in this paper exploit the social information produced by users in form of tags, titles and photo descriptions, for classifying pictures into different event categories. The extensive automated experiments demonstrate that our approach is very effective and opens new possibilities for multimedia retrieval, in particular image search. Moreover, the direct comparison with previous event detection algorithms confirm once more the quality of our methods. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Prefixed by a # symbol with a keyword, a Twitter hashtag serves as a bottom-up user-proposed tagging convention. It also embodies user participation in the process of hashtag innovation, especially as it pertains to information organization tasks. Diffusion of innovation (DoI) is a theory that helps to explain the adoption process of an innovation by modeling its entire life cycle according to the aspects of communications and human information interactions. Hence, diffusion theory offers valuable insights into interface design that supports Twitter hashtag use and access. It also assists in evaluating hashtag life cycles and thus offering information required for decision-making, in regard to hashtag management.},

abstract={Tagging has rapidly become a popular way to annotate the content on social network sites. Tags describe the contents of the resource or provide additional contextual and semantical information to make the content more easily browsable and discoverable by others. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and a certain number of resources have no comments, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context. The results of the evaluation show that tag recommendation based on local lexicon is an effective way to improve collaborative resource sharing in social network.},

abstract={This paper analyses the tagging patterns on delicious.com for a set of documents (URLs) over a 4 year period using informetrics methods to assess how collaborative tagging supports and enhances traditional document indexing. Results of the study show that there is still a mix of consensus and divergence in tagging term use and tagging patterns. While some of the chosen URLs maintained or even increased their popularity, others experienced a severe drop in popularity. Tag usage showed some measures of influence between taggers, but users continued to use their own tags and the proportions of unique and untagged items has increased. Proportions of tags used showed fluctuations with islands of stability over a 4 year period. Patterns in the usage of tags assigned to these documents also highlighted practices related to personal and collective information organisation which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

abstract={Web 2.0 and social/collaborative tagging have altered the traditional roles of indexer and user. Traditional indexing tools and systems assume the top-down approach to indexing in which a trained professional is responsible for assigning index terms to information sources with a potential user in mind. However, in today's Web, end users create, organize, index, and search for images and other information sources through social tagging and other collaborative activities. One of the impediments to user-centered indexing had been the cost of soliciting user-generated index terms or tags. Social tagging of images such as those on Flickr, an online photo management and sharing application, presents an opportunity that can be seized by designers of indexing tools and systems to bridge the semantic gap between indexer terms and user vocabularies. Empirical research on the differences and similarities between user-generated tags and index terms based on controlled vocabularies has the potential to inform future design of image indexing tools and systems. Toward this end, a random sample of Flickr images and the tags assigned to them were content analyzed and compared with another sample of index terms from a general image collection using established frameworks for image attributes and contents. The results show that there is a fundamental difference between the types of tags and types of index terms used. In light of this, implications for research into and design of user-centered image indexing tools and systems are discussed. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging has been gaining increasing popularity in a large variety of websites. The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

Several information management approaches, such as desktop search, document organization and (collaborative) document tagging have been proposed to address this, however they are either inappropriate or inefficient. Automated collaborative document tagging approaches mitigate the problems of manual tagging, but they are usually based on centralized settings which are plagued by problems such as scalability, privacy, etc. To resolve these issues, we present P2P DocTagger, an automated and distributed document tagging system based on classification in P2P networks. P2P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval.

abstract={Social tagging or collaborative tagging has become a new trend in the organization, management, and discovery of digital information. The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become a very popular way to share, annotate, and discover online resources in Web 2.0. Yet as the number of resources in Collaborative tagging system grows over time, sifting through the large amounts of resources and finding the right resources to recommend to the right user is becoming a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate a probabilistic generative model for collaborative tagging, explore the implicit semantic connections in the sparse and noisy information space of heterogeneous users and unsupervised tagging. First, a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to cluster the tags and users simultaneously. The generalization of resource description and user could alleviate the tag noise and data sparseness of recommendation effectively. And then, considering that topic-based recommendation only takes the users' global interest into consideration without the capability of distinguishing users' interest in detail, we combine the global interests with the individual interest and community interest. Experimental results demonstrate the topicbased personalized recommendation method, which integrate both the commonality factor among users and the specialties of individuals, could alleviate data sparsity and provide a more flexible and effective recommendation than previous methods.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

abstract={In collaborative filtering recommender systems, there is little room for users to get involved in the choice of their peer group. It leaves users defenseless against various spamming or "shilling" attacks. Other social Web-based systems, however, allow users to self-select peers and build a social network. We argue that users' self-defined social networks could be valuable to increase the quality of recommendation in CF systems. To prove the feasibility of this idea we examined how similar are interests of users connected by self-defined relationships in a collaborative tagging systems Citeulike. Interest similarity was measured by similarity of items and meta-data they share and tags they use. Our study shows that users connected by social networks exhibit significantly higher similarity on all explored levels (items, meta-data, and tags) than non-connected users. This similarity is the highest for directly connected users and decreases with the increase of distance between users. Among other interesting properties of information sharing is the finding that between-user similarity in social connections on the level of metadata and tags is much larger than similarity on the level of items. Overall, our findings support the feasibility of social network based recommender systems and offer some good hints to the prospective authors of these systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The vast amounts of video that need to be tagged preclude the exclusive use of professional indexers. Thus a significant amount of video will need to be tagged by non-experts. Are the tags created by experts demonstrably superior to those of non-experts, and when non-experts have to be used for tagging, is it better to rely on tags created by those who upload videos or on others who watch the videos? Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

abstract={Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit inuences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user inuences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit inuence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the inuential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Recent research provides evidence for the presence of emergent semantics in collaborative tagging systems. While several methods have been proposed, little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems. A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging: Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others. In this work, we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures. We distinguish between categorizers, who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes, and describers, who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords. To study our hypothesis, we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers. Our results not only show that "verbose" taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics, but also that a subset containing only 40% of the most 'verbose' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset. Moreover, the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics. This work is relevant for designers and analysts of tagging systems interested (i) in fostering the semantic development of their platforms, (ii) in identifying users introducing "semantic noise", and (iii) in learning ontologies. © 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract={Requirements engineering is essentially a social collaborative activity in which involved stakeholders have to closely work together to communicate, elicit, negotiate, define, confirm, and finally come up with the requirements for the system to be implemented or upgraded. In the development of large and complex systems, with a huge number of uncertain stakeholders, the requirements engineering process becomes a challenging task due to overwhelming and dynamic social interactions, tradeoffs, and collective decisions made by above stakeholders. Traditional approaches and techniques are deficient in supporting this kind of social interactions in requirements-related activities, and managing the evolving requirements and their traceability caused by the social interactions. This paper proposes to address the challenges in the pre-requirements analysis of large and complex systems by employing the techniques from collective intelligence based on Web 2.0 tools and technologies, which is composed of three steps: first, obtain collective requirements knowledge through collaborative tagging by stakeholders; second, transform collaborative requirement tags into requirement ontologies; third, support collective requirement decision-making (i.e., collective intelligence) based on the requirement ontologies through requirements reasoning. © 2010 ACM.},

In order to emphasize the difference between the two concepts, we have taken into consideration the following: new vs. returning visitors, visitor loyalty, length as well as the depth of the visit to the site. Analyzing the data, one can observe that the visitor loyalty, their lengthy visits to the site and the pages they view are much higher for the site built on the principles of Web 2.0, compared to the classical sites. Likewise, we developed and implemented a collaborative tagging system that allows every registered user to publish, save and label the content with the help of tags. Therefore, this can help in building a model that not only offers customized content but also adapts the site to user needs by providing a recommendation system and aggregate collective intelligence. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging systems such as Facebook, YouTube, del.icio.us, Flickr become popular recent years and have achieved widespread success. State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

Participants can apply tags to different points of the interaction as it is ongoing and can see, in near real-time, the "flow" of tags as they are being contributed. Two novel types of tags are proposed: "deep tags" that apply to a portion of the interaction and "instant tags" that apply to an instant of the interaction. Our system is being used by enterprise users and we analyze a corpus of 737 live-tags collected from 16 conversations that took place over several months. We found that the live-tags for audio have slightly different characteristics from Web 2.0 tags: they are longer and confer affordances on the audio like description and summarization. Some observations on the "cognitive cost" of live-tagging are offered. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user-generated metadata. These annotations represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they are attached to, but it is not obvious which characteristics of the objects are predominantly described. The usefulness of these tags for finding/re-finding the annotated resources is also not completely clear. Several studies have started to investigate these issues, however only by focusing on a single type of tagging system or resource. We study this problem across multiple domains and resource types and identify the gaps between the tag space and the querying vocabulary. Based on the findings of this analysis, we then try to bridge the identified gaps, focusing in particular on multimedia resources. We focus on the two scenarios of music and picture resources and develop algorithms, which identify usage (theme) and opinion (mood) characteristics of the items. The mood and theme labels our algorithms infer are recommended to the users, in order to support them during the annotation process. The evaluation of the proposed methods against user judgements, as well as against expert ground truth reveal the high quality of our recommended annotations and provide insights into possible extensions for music and picture tagging systems to support retrieval. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social content systems contain enormous collections of unstructured user-generated content, annotated by the collaborative effort of regular Internet users. Tag-clouds have become popular interfaces that allow users to query the database of these systems by clicking relevant terms. However, these single click queries are often not expressive enough to effectively retrieve the desired content. Users have to use multiple clicks or type longer queries to satisfy their information need. To enhance the predicted content ranking we use a random walk model that effectively integrates the user's preference and semantically related query terms. We use the collaborative annotations from a popular on-line book catalog to create a social annotation graph and study the effect of personalization and smoothing for increasing query lengths. We show that personalization and smoothing allow the user to find equally relevant content with fewer query terms compared to a frequency based content ranking with TF-IDF weighing. As expected, we see that the influence of the random walk model disappears if users type more detailed queries. Finally, we discuss the observations with respect to synonyms and homographs which are well known to hamper the performance of information retrieval systems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is a popular method in social resource sharing system. The reason why collaborative tagging system becomes popular is users can freely tags on the resources, like Flickr1 and Delicious2 . Any relationship between tags and resources are not made explicitly when tagging in folksonomy. Due to lack of semantic meaning, it is difficult for users to find related resources. Also, short of sufficient number of relevant tags increase the data sparsity which decreases the rate of information extraction against the user queries. Defining semantic relationship between tags, resources and users is an important research issue to retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this paper, we propose a WordNet based method to find the semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. Finally, the experiment results using Flickr data show our proposed method works well finding semantic relationship between tags in folksonomy. ©2010 IEEE.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a new knowledge propagation scheme to automatically propagate keywords from a subset of annotated images to the unannotated ones. The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation. Experimental results using 100 concept categories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The Games With A Purpose (GWAP) genre is a type of Human Computation that outsources certain steps of the computational process to humans. By taking advantage of people's desire to be entertained, GWAP attracts people to play voluntarily, and also produce useful metadata as a by-product. The games have shown promise in solving a variety of problems, which computer computation has been unable to resolve completely thus far. In this paper, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of GWAP systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of GWAP systems. We argue that it is important for GWAP systems to implement proper puzzle selection strategies in order to collect human intelligence in a more efficient manner. Therefore, based on our analysis, we implement an Optimal Puzzle Selection Strategy (OPSA) to improve GWAP systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed OPSA approach can effectively improve the system gain of GWAP systems, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large.

abstract={Collaborative tagging services (folksonomies) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era. They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications have attracted a considerable amount of attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.

abstract={Taxonomy is widely used in many of the website and directory navigation schemes for content/knowledge retrieval. However, information or content navigation support through taxonomy is often constrained due to its inability to take into account the full nomenclature and cultural nuances of knowledge seekers. The emergence and increasing adoption of collaborative tagging (social bookmarking) tools have provided lightweight and informal conceptual structures called folksonomies for knowledge retrieval. As for folksonomies, they reflect the vocabulary of the users. Hence, integrating folksonomies into a taxonomy combines the best of the two schemes as the resultant structure enhances taxonomy navigation with personsalisation for knowledge search and retrieval. This paper presents TaxoFolk, an algorithm for deriving hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy classification for enhanced knowledge navigation. The algorithm integrates folksonomy with a taxonomy through several unsupervised data mining techniques with augmented heuristics. © 2010 Operational Research Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications enable users to annotate online resources with user-generated keywords. The collection of these annotations and the way they connect users and resources produce a rich information space for users to explore. However the size, complexity and chaotic structure of these systems hamper users as they search for information. Recommenders can assist the user by suggesting resources, tags or even other users. Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions. Information channels can be used to explain the effectiveness of individual recommenders or explain the relative contribution of components in the hybrid recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Thanks to the continuous growth of collaborative platforms like YouTube, Flickr and Delicious, we are recently witnessing to a rapid evolution of web dynamics towards a more 'social' vision, called Web 2.0. In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

abstract={The explosion of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing, such as social networks, or video and photo sharing sites, radically changed the Web dynamics and the way people use and organize information. The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages. Results of experiments carried out on a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy, show that the use of content-based techniques improves the predictive accuracy of the tag recommender. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social media systems have encouraged end user participation in the Internet, for the purpose of storing and distributing Internet content, sharing opinions and maintaining relationships. Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A straightforward solution is to compute a PageRank-like algorithm on a facet-related graph, but it is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on the graph analysis of YouTube and Flickr, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results with two gold standards. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as a primary means for storing and sharing data among friends, family, colleagues, or perfect strangers as long as they have common interests. del.icio.us3 is a social network where people store and share their personal bookmarks. Most importantly, users tag their bookmarks for ease of information dissemination and later look up. However, it is the friendship links, that make del.icio.us a social network. They exist independently of the set of bookmarks that belong to the users and have no relation to the tags typically assigned to the bookmarks. To study the interaction among users, the strength of the existing links and their hidden meaning, we introduce implicit links in the network. These links connect only highly "similar " users. Here, similarity can reeflect different aspects of the user's profile that makes her similar to any other user, such as number of shared bookmarks, or similarity of their tags clouds. The authors investigate the question whether friends have common interests, they gain additional insights on the strategies that users use to assign tags to their bookmarks, and they demonstrate that the graphs formed by implicit links have unique properties differing from binomial random graphs or random graphs with an expected power-law degree distribution. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general framework that incorporates collaborative social tagging with a novel ontology scheme conveying multiple perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a framework where multiple users tag the same object (an image in this case) and an ontology is extended based on these tags while being tolerant of different points of view. Both the tagging and the ontological models are intentionally designed to suit the multi-perspective environment. The paper develops a method based on a set of rules that determine how to associate new concepts to predefined perspectives (in addition to determining relations to topics or other concepts as typically done in previous research) and how to insert and maintain multiple perspectives. Findings - This case study experiment, with a set of selected annotated images, indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model. Originality/value - The proposed framework characterises the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development of a multi-perspective ontology and its application to improve image annotation, searching and browsing. The significance of this research is that it focuses on exploring the impact of creating a constantly evolving ontology based on collaborative tagging. The paper is not aware of any other work that has attempted to devise such an environment and to study its dynamics. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Taxonomy construction is a resource-demanding, top-down, and time consuming effort. It does not always cater for the prevailing context of the captured information. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically convert tags into a hierarchical taxonomy. Folksonomy describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords or tags to shared content. Using folksonomy as a knowledge source for nominating tags, the proposed method first converts the tags into a hierarchy. This serves to harness a core set of taxonomy terms; the generated hierarchical structure facilitates users' information navigation behavior and permits personalizations. Newly acquired tags are then progressively integrated into a taxonomy in a largely automated way to complete the taxonomy creation process. Common taxonomy construction techniques are based on 3 main approaches: clustering, lexico-syntactic pattern matching, and automatic acquisition from machine-readable dictionaries. In contrast to these prevailing approaches, this paper proposes a taxonomy construction analysis based on heuristic rules and deep syntactic analysis. The proposed method requires only a relatively small corpus to create a preliminary taxonomy. The approach has been evaluated using an expert-defined taxonomy in the environmental protection domain and encouraging results were yielded. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={All computer software systems, whether online or offline, require a help system. Help texts are traditionally written by software development companies and answer targeted questions in the form of how-tos and troubleshooting procedures. However, when the popularity of an application grows, users of the application themselves start adding to the corpus of help for the system in the form of online tutorials. There is, however, one problem with such tutorials. They have no direct link with the software for which they are written. Users have to search the Internet for different tutorials that are usually hosted on dispersed locations, and there is no ideal way of finding the relevant information without ending up with lots of noise in the search results. In this chapter, we describe a model for a help system which enhances this concept using collaborative tagging for categorization of “helplets.” For the knowledge retrieval part of the system, we utilize a previously developed technique based on common sense and user personalization. We use a freely available common sense reasoning toolkit for knowledge retrieval. Our architecture can be implemented in Web-based systems as well as in stand-alone desktop applications. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

abstract={With a suitable algorithm for ranking the expertise of a user in a collaborative tagging system, we will be able to identify experts and discover useful and relevant resources through them. We propose that the level of expertise of a user with respect to a particular topic is mainly determined by two factors. Firstly, an expert should possess a high quality collection of resources, while the quality of a Web resource depends on the expertise of the users who have assigned tags to it. Secondly, an expert should be one who tends to identify interesting or useful resources before other users do. We propose a graph-based algorithm, SPEAR (SPamming-resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking), which implements these ideas for ranking users in a folksonomy. We evaluate our method with experiments on data sets collected from Delicious.com comprising over 71,000 Web documents, 0.5 million users and 2 million shared bookmarks. We also show that the algorithm is more resistant to spammers than other methods such as the original HITS algorithm and simple statistical measures. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications have become a popular tool allowing Internet users to manage online resources with tags. Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.

abstract={The proliferation of social web technologies such as collaborative tagging has led to an increasing awareness of their vulnerability to misuse. Attackers may attempt to distort the system's adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. Prior work on recommender systems has shown that studying different attack types, their properties and their impact, can help identify robust algorithms that make these systems more secure and less vulnerable to manipulation. Unlike traditional recommender systems, a tagging system includes multiple retrieval algorithms to facilitate browsing of resources, users and tags. The challenge is, therefore, evaluating the impact of various types of attacks across different navigation options. In this paper we develop a framework for characterizing attacks against tagging systems. We then propose a methodology for evaluating their global impact based on PageRank. Using real data from a popular tagging systems, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of several attack types. Our results help us understand how much effort is needed from an attacker to change the behavior of a tagging system and which attack types are more successful against such systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments on a real web-dataset collected from Regione Lazio Portal1.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label online resources. The tags are generally correlated and evolving according to the change of web contents, and the popularity of tags represent evolution of social interests. Tag taxonomy is a promising solution to organize the data in tagging systems. In this demonstration, we propose to construct the evolutionary taxonomy which incorporates the correlation and evolution of tags, as user generated tags grow and change temporally. We demonstrate that our approach is intuitive and efficient in tag organization which exploits the evolving characteristic of collaborative tagging systems. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems with user generated content have become a fundamental element of websites such as Delicious, Flickr or CiteULike. By sharing common knowledge, massively linked semantic data sets are generated that provide new challenges for data mining. In this paper, we reduce the data complexity in these systems by finding meaningful topics that serve to group similar users and serve to recommend tags or resources to users. We propose a well-founded probabilistic approach that can model every aspect of a collaborative tagging system. By integrating both user information and tag information into the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework, the developed models can be used to solve a number of important information extraction and retrieval tasks. © 2009 IEEE.},

Two documents that are maintained in the collection of the same user and/or assigned similar sets of tags can be considered as related from the perspective of the user, even though they may not be connected by hyperlinks. We call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents. We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks. This study suggests that by studying the collective behaviour of users we are able to enhance navigation and organisation of Web documents. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are social data repositories, in which users manage resources using descriptive keywords (tags). An important element of collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes a set of tags to each newly posted resource. In this paper we discuss the potential role of three tag sources: resource content as well as resource and user profiles in the tag recommendation system. Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for "content-based" and "graph-based" recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively.},

abstract={The number of published Web services has known a considerable growth these recent years making the task of finding the ones relevant to a requirement more and more complicated. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only in the internal characteristics related to Web service description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment. The success of Del.icio.us1, Flickr2, CiteULike3 and Connotea4 convinces us that collaborative tagging system is not only helpful in sharing and classifying Web resources but also can enhance the Web service discovery process. Without affecting actual Web 2.0 users' habit, we illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery (CoTE-WeD) allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. The system implementing our environment proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keyword-based and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed using WordNet 5 in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords.},

abstract={Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, like a web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model.We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of transfer learning is to improve prediction accuracy on a target task by exploiting the training examples for tasks that are related to the target one. Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The continuous growth of collaborative platforms we are recently witnessing made possible the passage from an 'elitary' Web, written by few and read by many, towards the so-called Web 2.0, a more 'user-centric' vision, where users become active contributors in Web dynamics. In this context, collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging: in these platforms users can annotate resources they like with freely chosen keyword (called tags) in order to make retrieval of information and serendipitous browsing more and more easier. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems (called tag recommenders) is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated by exploiting different approaches. In this paper we present a tag recommender developed for the ECML-PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge. Our approach is based on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources.},

abstract={Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

abstract={Tagging is a process whereby users freely choose keywords to label web objects in order to share or recover them later. Tags associated to an object by the user depict his viewpoint or perception. The perception of the target user can be enhanced by aggregating and analyzing the tags associated to an object by other users who share at least one tag with the target user in common for that object and recommending tags to him. Most of the existing techniques recommend tags on the basis of their popularity among the users. The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users. This relationship is analyzed using pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing tags as nodes. To observe the performance of our approach, experiments are carried out on the data collected from del.icio.us, a social book marking site that allows the users to tag URLs and share them with other people. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Performance of recommender systems depends on whether the user profiles contain accurate information about the interests of the users, and this in turn relies on whether enough information about their interests can be collected. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to use their own words to describe their favourite resources, resulting in some user-generated categorisation schemes commonly known as folksonomies. Folksonomies thus contain rich information about the interests of the users, which can be used to support various recommender systems. Our analysis of the folksonomy in Delicious reveals that the interests of a single user can be very diverse. Traditional methods for representing interests of users are usually not able to reflect such diversity. We propose a method to construct user profiles of multiple interests from folksonomies based on a network clustering technique. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is able to generate user profiles which reflect the diversity of user interests and can be used as a basis of providing more focused recommendation to the users. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Collaborative Tagging is a powerful method to create folksonomies that can be used to grasp/filter user preferences or enhance web search. Recent research has shown that depending on the number of users and the quality of user-provided tags powerful community-driven semantics or "ontologies" can emerge - as it was evident analyzing user data from social web applications such as del.icio.us or Flickr. Unfortunately, most web pages do not contain tags and, thus, no vocabulary that describes the information provided. A common problem in web page annotation is to motivate users for constant participation, i.e. tagging. In this paper we describe our approach of a binary verification game that embeds collaborative tagging into on-line games in order to produce domain specific folksonomies.

Our second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering (NwCF), incorporates the amount of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. A modified version of the Okapi BM25 IR model over users' tags is implemented on our third approach to form the user neighborhood. Our results suggest that incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, and they also support that tags can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors in a collaborative tagging system.},

To address these issues, we propose a multi-step approach for creating domain specific concept hierarchies from collaborative tags.

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow users to annotate online resources. The result is a complex tapestry of interrelated users, resources and tags often called a folksonomy. Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

abstract={Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

abstract={Social networks and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity as primary means for sorting and sharing data: users tag their bookmarks in order to simplify information dissemination and later lookup. Social Bookmarking services are useful in two important respects: first, they can allow an individual to remember the visited URLs, and second, tags can be made by the community to guide users towards valuable content. In this paper we focus on the latter use: we present a novel approach for personalized web search using query expansion. We further extend the family of well-known co-occurence matrix technique models by using a new way of exploring social tagging services. Our approach shows its strength particularly in the case of disambiguation of word contexts. We show how to design and implement such a system in practice and conduct several experiments. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study centered on using social bookmarking and tagging techniques for personalization of web search and its evaluation in a real-world scenario. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={The amount of text data on the Internet is growing at a very fast rate. Online text repositories for news agencies, digital libraries and other organizations currently store giga- and tera-bytes of data. Large amounts of unstructured text poses a serious challenge for data mining and knowledge extraction. End user participation coupled with distributed computation can play a crucial role in meeting these challenges. In many applications involving classification of text documents, web users often participate in the tagging process. This collaborative tagging results in the formation of large scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems which can function, scale and self-organize in the presence of highly transient population of nodes and do not need a central server for co-ordination. In this paper, we describe TagLearner, a P2P classifier learning system for extracting patterns from text data where the end users can participate both in the task of labeling the data and building a distributed classifier on it. We present a novel distributed linear programming based classification algorithm which is asynchronous in nature.

abstract={In recent years, tagging systems have been paid increasing attentions from both research communities and system designers. Most popular online social networking sites harness tag for managing and locating contents, for organizing and connecting users, and for recommending and sharing resources. We believe that tag acts like bridge between people and resources. Research on tag and tagging behavior will provide us insight about resource space and user activities on the Internet. In this paper, we present a two-level analysis of the tagging system of Del.icio.us. The results from both two levels confirm each other. In network level, we connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a social network of tags. By investigating its network feature, we find phenomena of small world and scale-free network. We also discover that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness. In individual level, users' tagging behaviors and patterns are observed by visualizing their bookmarking history on Del.icio.us. Besides, we study the linked users by their tags and find that users within a subscription network share more common interests than random pairs of users. During the analysis, we also discuss the implications of the findings for the design of tag-based system. © 2009 ACM.},

In order to improve recommendation results during this cold start period, we present a probabilistic approach to item recommendation. Our model extends previously proposed models such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) by merging both user-item as well as item-tag observations into a unified representation. We find that bringing tags into play reduces the risk of overfitting and increases overall recommendation quality. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other types of recommenders.

abstract={Social tagging systems present a new challenge to the researchers working on recommender systems. The presence of tags, which uncover the reasons of user interests to tagged items, opens a way to increase the quality of recommendations. Yet, there is no common agreement of how the power of tags can be harnessed for recommendation. In this paper we argue for the use of spreading activation approach for building tag-aware recommender systems and suggest a specific version of this approach adapted to the multidimensional nature of social tagging networks. We introduce the asymmetric measure of relevancy (proximity) of two nodes on a multidimensional network as a cumulative strength of (weighted) multiple connections between two nodes, which includes paths and graph-structures connecting the nodes. This metric is also applicable to measure relevancy of two sub-graphs. Spreading activation methods (SAM), which usually employ breadth first search, are an efficient way to define and compute such measure taking into account not only links constituent a path, but the properties of nodes in the path such as node's types and outdegree. We apply this notion of relevancy to measure similarity of collaborative tagging systems users and present the results of numerical simulation showing that spreading activation methods allow us to discriminate between diverse graph-structures connecting users via resources and tags. We show that the results of simulation are stable w.r.t. the variation of parameters of spreading activation algorithm used in our experiment.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr have achieved great success. This chapter is concerned with the problem of social tagging analysis and mining. More specifically, we discuss five properties of social tagging and their applications: 1) keyword property, which means social annotations serve as human selected keywords for Web resources; 2) semantic property, which indicates semantic relations among tags and Web resources; 3) hierarchical property, which means that hierarchical structure can be derived from the flat social tagging space; 4) quality property, which means that Web resources' qualities are varied and can be quantified using social tagging; 5) distribution property, which indicates the distribution of frequencies of social tags usually converges to a power-law distribution. These properties are the most principle characteristics, which have been popularly discussed and explored in many applications. As a case study, we show how to improve the social resource browsing by applying the five properties of social tags. © 2010, IGI Global.},

abstract={The discipline of finding and recommending new and similar multimedia content has gained a growing importance in multimedia information retrieval over the last years. The two classical approaches, namely Content-based filtering (CB) and Collaborative filtering (CF), can be used in conjunction with each other to get benefit from both content analysis and user feedback. This paper introduces a system, called GlobalMusic2one that implements a novel approach to hybrid music search by combining methods of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Web 2.0 techniques to reach a new quality in recommending and distributing global music collections. To be able to classify these collections and to determine relationships between them, textual descriptions are gathered by collaborative tagging and statistical Web document analysis, as relevant documents in the Web may contain a lot of freely accessible and descriptive information on music content. The resulting text corpus can be used to identify connected entities, e.g. which artist is connected or similar to another artist. Therefore, this approach sensibly complements CB and CF techniques and has already been successfully implemented in the interactive music search system NIMS, which will be introduced as well.},

Each peer maintains relevant personalized information about its tagging behavior as well as that of its social neighbors, and uses those to locally process its queries. Extensive experiments based on a real-world dataset crawled from del.icio.us shows that very little storage at each peer suffices to get almost the same results as a hypothetical centralized solution with infinite storage.

abstract={Social networking and tagging have taken off at an unexpected scale and speed, opening huge opportunities to enhance the user search experience. We present Gossple 1, a new, user-centric, approach to improve the exploration of the Internet. Underlying Gossple lies the intuition that while social networks provides news from your old buddies, you can learn a lot more from people you don't know, but with whom you share many (tagging) interests. More specifically, considering a collaborative tagging system with active taggers annotating content, Gossple expands the search query, of any user u, with tags that are considered "close" enough with respect to users that are "close" to u. Gossple users create their own network of social acquaintances in a gossip-based manner, by dynamically computing the estimation of a distance between taggers, based on cosine similarity between tags and items. These connections are used to feed a TagMap: our central abstraction that captures the personalised relationships between tags. The TagMap is then used by Gossple to meaningfully expand queries leveraging the personalised network. This is achieved through the TagRank algorithm, an adaptation of the celebrated pagerank algorithm, which automatically determines which tags best expand a list of tags in a given query. Gossple has no central authority: every user stores its own items and its tagging behaviour is stored only by its neighbours. The resulting networks are live, dynamic and do not require any underlying structure. We report on our evaluation of Gossple with CiteUlike traces, involving 33, 834 users. In short, we show that, with little information stored at every peer, Gossple enables to retrieve items that cannot be retrieved with state of the art search systems (complete- ness).Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Social networking sites like Flickr1, Youtube2 and Del.icio.us3 have been rapidly gaining popularity on the Internet, underscoring a transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. With this process, social tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. Folksonomy are data created in social tagging. Tags in folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition on information. They can reveal both the users' behavior and resources' properties. In this paper, we will study the vocabulary of users' tagging and the relationship between words. We connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a network of folksonomy, and investigate the semantic relatedness between tags within it. The result shows that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness, which is useful for designing future folksonomy-based systems. © 2009 IEEE.},

Our goal is to demonstrate practically that the aggregated tags applied to resources by the entire community define reasonably well resource meaning. This would allow using them for calculating semantic distance between resources. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed a large amount of data downloaded from del.icio.us. To this end, we developed an algorithm for searching 'similar' URLs based on the similarity of their aggregated tag vectors, which allowed us to identify clusters of similar resources. Our experimental findings demonstrate that massive tagging of resources leads to resource meanings that are defined bottom-up, and they prove the effectiveness of collaborative tagging systems for describing resources. © 2008 IEEE.},

We discuss techniques for mapping human activities onto Web services. We present a recommendation algorithm that is based on collaborative tagging of resources in SOA.

Based on the semantic analysis of the collaborative tags in Last.fm, the semantic similar tags are clustered into different groups and the visual distance represents the semantic similarity between tags, and thus the visualization offers a better semantic understanding of collaborative tags. A comparative evaluation is conducted with TagClouds and TagClusters based on the same tags collection.

abstract={Nowadays, the most dominant and noteworthy web information sources are developed according to the collaborative-web paradigm, also known as Web 2.0. In particular, it represents a novel paradigm in the way users interact with the web. Users (also called prosumers) are no longer passive consumers of published content, but become involved, implicitly and explicitly, as they cooperate by providing their own resources in an "architecture of participation". In this scenario, collaborative tagging, i.e., the process of classifying shared resources by using keywords, becomes more and more popular. The main problem in such task is related to well-known linguistic phenomena, such as polysemy and synonymy, making effective content retrieval harder. In this paper, an approach that monitors users activity in a tagging system and dynamically quantifies associations among tags is presented. The associations are then used to create tags clusters. Experiments are performed comparing the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art tag clustering technique. Results -given in terms of classical precision and recall- show that the approach is quite effective in the presence of strongly related tags in a cluster. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Web 2.0 applications such as delicious, flickr or lastfm have recently become extremely popular and as a result, a large amount of semantically rich metadata produced by users becomes available and exploitable. Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

abstract={Email is no longer perceived as a communication marvel, but rather as a constant source of information overload. Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

abstract={As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, music genre classification has attracted considerable research attention. Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

abstract={Recommendations in collaborative tagging sites such as del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies, are becoming increasingly important, due to the proliferation of general queries on those sites and the ineffectiveness of the traditional search paradigm to address those queries. Regardless of the underlying recommendation strategy, item-based or user-based, one of the key concerns in producing recommendations, is over-specialization, which results in returning items that are too homogeneous. Traditional solutions rely on post-processing returned items to identify those which differ in their attribute values (e.g., genre and actors for movies). Such approaches are not always applicable when intrinsic attributes are not available (e.g., URLs in del.icio.us). In a recent paper [20], we introduced the notion of explanation-based diversity and formalized the diversification problem as a compromise between accuracy and diversity. In this paper, we develop efficient diversification algorithms built upon this notion. The algorithms explore compromises between accuracy and diversity. We demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in diversification on two real life data sets: del.icio.us and Yahoo! Movies. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have recently emerged as one of the rapidly growing web 2.0 applications. The informal social classification structure in these systems, also known as folksonomy, provides a convenient way to annotate resources by allowing users to use any keyword or tag that they find relevant. In turn, the flat and non-hierarchical structure with unsupervised vocabularies leads to low search precision and poor resource navigation and retrieval. This drawback has created the need for ontological structures which provide shared vocabularies and semantic relations for translating and integrating the different sources. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for extracting ontological structure from folksonomies that exploits the power of low support association rule mining supplemented by an upper ontology such as WordNet. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We consider the problem of tag prediction in collaborative tagging systems where users share and annotate resources on the Web. We put forward HAMLET, a novel approach to automatically propagate tags along the edges of a graph which relates similar documents. We identify the core principles underlying tag propagation for which we derive suitable scoring models combined in one overall ranking formula. Leveraging these scores, we present an efficient top-k tag selection algorithm that infers additional tags by carefully inspecting neighbors in the document graph. Experiments using real-world data demonstrate the viability of our approach in large-scale environments where tags are scarce. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This article uses data from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to empirically examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems and to study how coherent categorization schemes emerge from unsupervised tagging by individual users. First, we study the formation of stable distributions in tagging systems, seen as an implicit form of “consensus” reached by the users of the system around the tags that best describe a resource. We show that final tag frequencies for most resources converge to power law distributions and we propose an empirical method to examine the dynamics of the convergence process, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The convergence analysis is performed for both the most utilized tags at the top of tag distributions and the so-called long tail. Second, we study the information structures that emerge from collaborative tagging, namely tag correlation (or folksonomy) graphs.We show how community-based network techniques can be used to extract simple tag vocabularies from the tag correlation graphs by partitioning them into subsets of related tags. Furthermore, we also show, for a specialized domain, that shared vocabularies produced by collaborative tagging are richer than the vocabularies which can be extracted from large-scale query logs provided by a major search engine. © 2009, ACM.

abstract={Most of the existing personal knowledge management systems have been employing blogging services which is capable of providing various services (e.g., knowledge distribution and knowledge creation) to people. However, automated knowledge delivering service among the systems is difficult to take into account the corresponding context (or semantics) of the knowledge, so that the service can spread irrelevant information into knowledge management systems. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a novel architecture, called blog context overlay network, to fulfill context matching between blog-based knowledge management systems. It is referred to as detecting 'shared' context between knowledge management systems. Thus, with respect to the contexts, we want to identify a community of practice (CoP) on a knowledge blogosphere where a set of blog-based knowledge management systems are incorporating with each other. As a result, newly generated knowledge can be proactively diffused to the blog-based knowledge management systems of which context is relevant to the knowledge, even before the bloggers' queries are explicitly asked. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For the collaborative tagging information implies user's important personal preference information, it can be used to recommend personalized items to users. This paper proposes a novel tag-based collaborative filtering approach for recommending personalized items to users of online communities that are equipped with tagging facilities. Based on the distinctive three dimensional relationships among users, tags and items, a new similarity measure method is proposed to generate the neighborhood of users with similar tagging behavior instead of similar implicit ratings. The promising experiment result shows that by using the tagging information the proposed approach outperforms the standard user and item based collaborative filtering approaches. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Rather than following a collaborative filtering or annotation-based approach to recommendation, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) approach and present a unified recommendation model which evolves from item user and item tag co-occurrences in parallel. The inclusion of tags reduces known collaborative filtering problems related to overfitting and allows for higher quality recommendations.

abstract={Multimedia content is uploaded, tagged and recommended by users of collaborative systems such as YouTube and Flickr. These systems can be represented as tagged-graphs, where nodes correspond to users and tagged-links to recommendations. In this paper we analyze the online computation of user-rankings associated to a set of tags, called a facet. A simple approach to faceted ranking is to apply an algorithm that calculates a measure of node centrality, say, PageRank, to a subgraph associated with the given facet. This solution, however, is not feasible for online computation. We propose an alternative solution: (i) first, a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of tag-related subgraphs; (ii) then, a faceted order is generated online by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. Based on empirical observations, we show that step (i) is scalable. We also present efficient algorithms for step (ii), which are evaluated by comparing their results to those produced by the direct calculation .},

abstract={The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system provides relevance searching, which is more effective than traditional keyword searching for searching personal resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

abstract={Consumer Generated Media(CGM) is growing rapidly and the amount of content is increasing. However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We propose the utilization of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicates that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we aim at finding informative usage patterns from tags by consistent clustering on tags using nonnegative matrix factorization. The clustered subjects, represented by weighed tag vectors, can then be used to build a subjectcentered user information seeking model for item recommendation. Experiments on two realworld datasets show that our subject-based algorithms substantially outperform the traditional CF methods as well as tag-enhanced recommendation approaches reported in the literature.},

abstract={This paper presents an in-depth study of the social tagging mechanisms used in Freesound.org, an online community where users share and browse audio files by means of tags and content-based audio similarity search. We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

abstract={More and more information is available on the Web, and the current search engines do a great job to make it accessible. Yet, optimizing for a large number of users, they usually provide good answers only to "most of us", and have yet to provide satisfying mechanisms to search for audiovisual content. In this talk I will present some ongoing work at L3S addressing these challenges, done in the context of several European Union funded projects on personal information management and web search. Regarding personalization, I will talk about personalizing Web Search based on user content, which goes beyond simple user profiles used in other systems. The algorithms presented improve Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each user's personal information repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. Generating the additional query keywords is done by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Extensive empirical analysis shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Regarding search for audiovisual content, I will focus on exploiting user generated information, and discuss what kinds of tags are used for different resources and how they can help for search. Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. I will present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for different kinds of resources - Web pages, music, and images. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

The research addresses two complementary goals: using ICT to support the simplification of the corpus of norms and using ICT to facilitate search and retrieval of information in large archives in the legal domain. The contribution of this work is in the development of tools beyond state of the art for the e-discovery of relationships between sections of norms or other legal documents. To reach the best results in terms of effectiveness, the tools combine statistical and the semantic approaches. The effectiveness of the statistical tool has been measured in terms of precision, through an assessment procedure that involved some experts of the legal domain.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linking of a folksonomy (user vocabulary) and LCSH (controlled vocabulary) on the basis of word matching, for the potential use of LCSH in bringing order to folksonomies. Design/methodology/approach A selected sample of a folksonomy from a popular collaborative tagging system, Delicious, was wordmatched with LCSH. LCSH was transformed into a tree structure called an LCSH tree for the matching. A close examination was conducted on the characteristics of folksonomies, the overlap of folksonomies with LCSH, and the distribution of folksonomies over the LCSH tree. Findings The experimental results showed that the total proportion of tags being matched with LC subject headings constituted approximately twothirds of all tags involved, with an additional 10 percent of the remaining tags having potential matches. A number of barriers for the linking as well as two areas in need of improving the matching are identified and described. Three important tag distribution patterns over the LCSH tree were identified and supported: skewedness, multifacet, and Zipfianpattern. Research limitations/implications The results of the study can be adopted for the development of innovative methods of mapping between folksonomy and LCSH, which directly contributes to effective access and retrieval of tagged web resources and to the integration of multiple information repositories based on the two vocabularies. Practical implications The linking of controlled vocabularies can be applicable to enhance information retrieval capability within collaborative tagging systems as well as across various tagging system information depositories and bibliographic databases. Originality/value This is among frontier works that examines the potential of linking a folksonomy, extracted from a collaborative tagging system, to an authoritymaintained subject heading system. It provides exploratory data to support further advanced mapping methods for linking the two vocabularies. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, supported by many social networking websites, is currently enjoying an increasing popularity. The usefulness of this largely available tag data has been explored in many applications including web resources categorization,deriving emergent semantics, web search etc. However, since tags are supplied by users freely, not all of them are useful and reliable, especially when they are generated by spammers with malicious intent. Therefore, identifying tags of high quality is crucial in improving the performance of applications based on tags. In this paper, we propose TRP-Rank (Tag-Resource Pair Rank), an algorithm to measure the quality of tags by manually assessing a seed set and propagating the quality through a graph. The three dimensional relationship among users, tags and web resources is firstly represented by a graph structure. A set of seed nodes, where each node represents a tag annotating a resource, is then selected and their quality is assessed. The quality of the remaining nodes is calculated by propagating the known quality of the seeds through the graph structure. We evaluate our approach on a public data set where tags generated by suspicious spammers were manually labelled. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in measuring the quality of tags. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recently, many Web services such as social networking services, blogs, and collaborative tagging have become widely popular. Many attempts are being made to investigate user interactions by analyzing social networks among users. However, analyzing a social network with attributional data is often not an easy task because numerous ways exist to define features through aggregation of different tables. In this study, we propose an algorithm to identify important network-based features systematically from a given social network to analyze user behavior efficiently and to expand the services. We apply our method for link-based classification and link prediction tasks with two different datasets, i.e., an @cosme (an online viral marketing site) dataset and a Hatena Bookmark (collaborative tagging service) dataset, to demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm. Our algorithm is general and can provide useful network-based features for social network analyses. Copyright © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Considering the natural tendency of people to follow direct or indirect cues of other people's activities, collaborative filtering-based recommender systems often predict the utility of an item for a particular user according to previous ratings by other similar users. Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have nowadays become important data sources for populating semantic web applications. For tasks like synonym detection and discovery of concept hierarchies, many researchers introduced measures of tag similarity. Even though most of these measures appear very natural, their design often seems to be rather ad hoc, and the underlying assumptions on the notion of similarity are not made explicit. A more systematic characterization and validation of tag similarity in terms of formal representations of knowledge is still lacking. Here we address this issue and analyze several measures of tag similarity: Each measure is computed on data from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us and a semantic grounding is provided by mapping pairs of similar tags in the folksonomy to pairs of synsets in Wordnet, where we use validated measures of semantic distance to characterize the semantic relation between the mapped tags. This exposes important features of the investigated similarity measures and indicates which ones are better suited in the context of a given semantic application. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social bookmarking is the process through which users share tags for online resources like blogs with others. Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

abstract={This research paper reports part of a larger international study that employs collaborative tagging for effectively describing knowledge and learning resources (KLR) in an institutionalised setting. The number of these resources has increased enormously within organisations over time and with an increasing variety of quality standards, maturity and granularity of resources, the description of content with metadata becomes more and more challenging. Automatic extraction services and professional metadata authoring tools could not deliver the expected results. Therefore, this research project investigated and discussed collaborative tagging as a means to successfully tag KLR. This paper presents results of an online survey distributed to first-year Information Systems students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The results report on the study's key themes of commitment and convergence towards generally accepted collaborative tags. Commitment and convergence could be confirmed, but there is a need for further exploration with a higher number of participants. Collaborative tagging is suggested as a solution to facilitate the development of ontologies for describing organisational metadata. © 2008 Ronald Maier, Silke Retzer and Stefan Thalmann.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

In our paper, we have proposed a collective collaborative tagging (CCT) service architecture in which both service providers and individual users can merge folksonomy data (in the form of keyword tags) stored in different sources to build a larger, unified repository. We have also examined a range of algorithms that can be applied to different problems in folksonomy analysis and information discovery. These algorithms address several common problems for online systems: searching, getting recommendations, finding communities of similar users, and finding interesting new information by trends. Our contributions are to a) systematically examine the available public algorithms' application to tag-based folksonomies, and b) to propose a service architecture that can provide these algorithms as online capabilities.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging sites presents a unique opportunity to explore keyword search in a context where query results are determined by the opinion of a network of taggers related to a seeker. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers. Our results are supported by extensive experiments on del.icio.us datasets. © 2008 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={Rapid growth of published Web services makes their discoveries more and more difficult. Many approaches are proposed to solve this discovery issue. Most of them are interested only Web service's description itself and neglect the user-centric aspect of the discovery process. User's involvement may be seen as contributing information, after using or testing a service, which marks the personal opinion on service's functionality, quality or invocation cost. This kind of contribution is perceived as a participative aspect inside the Web 2.0 environment and can enhance the Web service discovery process. We illustrate in this research work, a collaborative tagging-based environment for Web service discovery, allowing users to tag or annotate a Web service using keyword or free-text. Our system proposes consequently two types of query to search tagged Web services: keywordbased and free-text. We put in place an advanced mode in the discovery by keyword which offers different ways to combine keywords together inside a query to make it more flexible and accurate. In both types of look-up (by keyword and by free-text), synonym relation between terms is processed in order to enhance the similarity computing between a query and the tagged web services. The Web services found after a discovery process are ranked according to their tags' weight, in the case of discovery by keywords. © 2008 IEEE.},

We also put forward the necessary data standards to interoperate at both data format and semantic levels. We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms. This improves search results in terms of recall and precision, and represents an innovative means of semantics-aware collaborative filtering and content ranking. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Whereas the number of services that are provided online is growing rapidly, current service discovery approaches seem to have problems fulfilling their objectives. Existing approaches are hampered by the complexity of underlying semantic service models and by the fact that they try to impose a technical vocabulary to users. This leads to what we call the service discovery gap. In this paper we envision an approach that allows users to query or browse services using free text tags, thus providing an interface in terms of the users' vocabulary instead of the service's vocabulary. Unlike simple keyword search, we envision tag clouds associated with services themselves as semantic descriptions carrying collaborative knowledge about the service that can be clustered hierarchically, forming lightweight "ontologies". Besides tag-based discovery only describing the service on a global view, we envision refined tags and refined search/discovery in terms of the concepts that are common to all current semantic service description models, i.e. input, output, and operation. We argue that Service matching can be achieved, by applying tag-cloud-based service similarity on the one hand and by clustering services using case based indexing and retrieval techniques on the other hand.},

abstract={There is a growing interest into how we represent and share tagging data in collaborative tagging systems. Conventional tags, meaning freely created tags that are not associated with a structured ontology, are not naturally suited for collaborative processes, due to linguistic and grammatical variations, as well as human typing errors. Additionally, tags reflect personal views of the world by individual users, and are not normalised for synonymy, morphology or any other mapping. Our view is that the conventional approach provides very limited semantic value for collaboration. Moreover, in cases where there is some semantic value, automatically sharing semantics via computer manipulations is extremely problematic. This paper explores these problems by discussing approaches for collaborative tagging activities at a semantic level, and presenting conceptual models for collaborative tagging activities and folksonomies. We present criteria for the comparison of existing tag ontologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in relation to these criteria.},

While collaborative tagging offers many advantages, they also suffer from several limitations, with a major one being the existence of ambiguous tags. To understand what an ambiguous tag is intended to mean, we need to know the contexts in which it is used. Instead of using common large scale clustering techniques on folksonomies, we believe tags can be better contextualised by the social contexts in which they are used. We propose a method to reveal semantics of ambiguous tags by studying the collective user behaviour in a tagging system.

Collaborative tagging systems allow people to organize a set of resources of interest through unconstrained annotations based on free keywords commonly named tags. Suggestive tagging techniques support users in this organization process and have shown to be helpful also in fostering a quick convergence to a shared tag vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a tag recommender which relies on the content analysis of the resource to be tagged, as well as on the personal and collective tagging history. The main contribution of this work is a model which combines semantic content analysis methods with existing suggestive tagging techniques. The expected benefit is the improvement of the user experience in social bookmarking systems, and more generally in collaborative tagging systems.},

abstract={Consumer Generated Media (CGM) is growing rapidly and the amount of content is increasing. However, it is often difficult for users to extract important contents and the existence of contents recording their experiences can easily be forgotten. As there are no methods or systems to indicate the subjective value of the contents or ways to reuse them, subjective annotation appending subjectivity, such as feelings and intentions, to contents is needed. Representation of subjectivity depends on not only verbal expression, but also nonverbal expression. Linguistically expressed annotation, typified by collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems, has come into widespread use, but there is no system of nonverbally expressed annotation on the web. We proposed the use of controllable avatars as a means of nonverbal expression of subjectivity, and confirmed the consistency of feelings elicited by avatars over time for an individual and in a group. In addition, we compared the expressiveness and ease of subjective annotation between collaborative tagging and controllable avatars. The result indicated that the feelings evoked by avatars are consistent in both cases, and using controllable avatars is easier than collaborative tagging for representing feelings elicited by contents that do not express meaning, such as photos.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems, sometimes referred to as "folksonomies," enable Internet users to annotate or search for resources using custom labels instead of being restricted by pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchies. However, the flexibility of tagging brings with it certain costs. Because users are free to apply any tag to any resource, tagging systems contain large numbers of redundant, ambiguous, and idiosyncratic tags which can render resource discovery difficult. Data mining techniques such as clustering can be used to ameliorate this problem by reducing noise in the data and identifying trends. In particular, discovered patterns can be used to tailor the system's output to a user based on the user's tagging behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to personalize a user's experience within a folksonomy using clustering. A personalized view can overcome ambiguity and idiosyncratic tag assignment, presenting users with tags and resources that correspond more closely to their intent. Specifically, we examine unsupervised clustering methods for extracting commonalities between tags, and use the discovered clusters as intermediaries between a user's profile and resources in order to tailor the results of search to the user's interests. We validate this approach through extensive evaluation of proposed personalization algorithm and the underlying clustering techniques using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site.

abstract={Collaborative tagging is the aggregate effort by a community of online users to annotate web content with metadata labels called tags. It is a simple activity that enriches our knowledge about digital content, and has gained popularity with services such as Del.icio.us. Del.icio.us has a large repository that evolves daily, presenting interesting new problems for IR. We present TagScore, a scoring function to rate the goodness of Del.icio.us tags for their associated web page. It gives us a succinct synopsis for a page that we can use to efficiently find similar pages. Using real Del.icio.us data, we show that our approach gives good correlation to cosine similarity but is several hundred times faster and requires minimal storage overhead. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of collaborative tagging systems, services that assist the user in the task of tagging, such as tag recommenders, are more and more required. Being the scenario similar to traditional recommender systems where nearest neighbor algorithms, better known as collaborative filtering, were extensively and successfully applied, the application of the same methods to the problem of tag recommendation seems to be a natural way to follow. However, it is necessary to take into consideration some particularities of these systems, such as the absence of ratings and the fact that two entity types in a rating scale correspond to three top level entity types, i.e., user, resources and tags. In this paper we cast the tag recommendation problem into a collaborative filtering perspective and starting from a view on the plain recommendation task without attributes, we make a ground evaluation comparing different tag recommender algorithms on real data.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizingWeb resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. This paper is the first to present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for very different kinds of resources and systems - Web pages (Del.icio.us), music (Last.fm), and images (Flickr) - and compares the results with anchor text characteristics. We analyze and classify sample tags from these systems, to get an insight into what kinds of tags are used for different resources, and provide statistics on tag distributions in all three tagging environments. Since even relevant tags may not add new information to the search procedure, we also check overlap of tags with content, with metadata assigned by experts and from other sources. We discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search, comparing them with user queries posted to search engines as well as through a user survey. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags.

abstract={Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstr tes more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of the correlation of annotated information unit (textual) tags and geographical identification metadata geotags. Despite the increased usage of geotagging in collaborative tagging systems, most current research focuses on textual tagging alone in solving the tag search problem. This may result in difficulties to search for precise and relevant information within the given tag space. For example, inconsistencies like polysemy, synonyms, and word inflections with plural forms complicate the tag search problem. Therefore, more work needs to be done to include geotag information with existing tagging information for analysis. In this paper, to make geotagging possible to be used in analysis with tagging, we prove that there is a strong correlation between tagging and geotagging information. Our approach uses tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity to determine inter-relationships among tags and geotags. From our initial experiments, we show that the power law is established between tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity: this means that tag similarity and geographical distribution similarity has a strong correlation and the correlation can be used to find more relevant tags in the tag space. The power law confirms that there is an increased relationship between tagging and geotagging and the increased relationship is scalable in size of tags and geotags. Also, using both geotagging and tagging information instead of only tagging, we show that the uncertainty between derived and actual similarities among tags is reduced. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Information on Web2.0, generated by users of web based services, is both difficult to organize and organic in nature. Content categorization and search in such situation offers challenging scenarios. The primary means of content categorization in such social services is folk-sonomy or collaborative tagging. During search in folksonomy, several issues arise due to lexical ambiguities in the way users choose tags to represent content. These are issues of different words representing the same concept, same words representing different concepts and variances in level of expertise of users. Past techniques to address these issues have worked on lexical analysis of term and have thus had only moderate levels of success. We have developed a model in which machine common sense and personalization is used to address these issues. In this paper, we explain our approach in detail, describe a prototype developed for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility of our approach and discuss an effectiveness study conducted to measure the success of our model. The results of the study are analyzed and future directions along this path of research are presented.},

abstract={Nowadays the Web represents a growing collection of an enormous amount of contents where the need for better ways to find and organize the available data is becoming a fundamental issue, in order to deal with information overload. Keyword based Web searches are actually the preferred mean to seek for contents related to a specific topic. Search engines and collaborative tagging systems make possible the search for information thanks to the association of descriptive keywords to Web resources. All of them show problems of inconsistency and consequent reduction of recall and precision of searches, due to polysemy, synonymy and in general all the different lexical forms that can be used to refer to a particular meaning. A possible way to face or at least reduce these problems is represented by the introduction of semantics to characterize the contents of Web resources: each resource is described by one or more concepts instead of simple and often ambiguous keywords. To support these task the availability of a global semantic resource of reference is fundamental. On the basis of our past experience with the semantic tagging of Web resources and the SemKey Project, we are developing Tagpedia, a general-domain "encyclopedia" of tags, semantically structured for generating semantic descriptions of contents over the Web, created by mining Wikipedia. In this paper, starting from an analysis of the weak points of non-semantic keyword based Web searches, we introduce our idea of semantic characterization of Web resources describing the structure and organization of Tagpedia. We introduce our first realization of Tagpedia, suggesting all the possible improvements that can be carried out in order to exploit its full potential.},

When users click on a tag included in the tag cloud while watching the video, the tag gets associated with the time point of the video. Users can share the information on the tags that have already been clicked. We confirmed that the coverage of annotations generated by this method is higher than that of the existing methods, and users are motivated to add tags by using tag-sharing and tag-cloud methods.

abstract={Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one. © 2008 ACM.},

We motivate the preferred usage of feeds compared to full site grabbing, and present analysis results of feed data from a period of one month concerning feature distribution, growth, stability and convergence aspects. Furthermore we compare tag spaces and their intersections for potential interoperability and integration of these services, and reveal that tags in practice are not really as freely chosen as often promised.},

The objective of this research is to analyze the descriptors and tags from journal articles indexed in the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and the folksonomy-based website CiteULike to determine overlap between the controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies. Metadata from 2,786 journal articles indexed in ERIC and CiteULike was collected using Perl and MySQL. The total metadata was comprised of 2,899 unique ERIC descriptors, 3,176 unique CiteULike tags, and 1,083 unique CiteULike users. An analysis of this metadata revealed that 240 of the CiteULike tags matched ERIC descriptors. The low number of tag-descriptor matches in this research indicates that CiteULike users do not use the same terminology as subject specialists who maintain descriptors in the ERIC thesaurus.

abstract={Recommender Systems (RS) aim at predicting items or ratings of items that the user are interested in. Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are "global" descriptions of items, tags are "local" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tagaware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three twodimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords - so called "tags" - to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is against the dynamically evolving nature of many contemporary media applications to be analysed in terms of conventional rigid ontologies that rely on expertise-based fixed categories and hierarchical structure. Many of these rely on sharing 'folksonomies', personal descriptions of information and objects for one's own retrieval. Such applications involve many feedback mechanisms via the community, and have been shown to have emergent properties of complex dynamic systems. We propose that such dynamically evolving information domains can be more usefully described by means of a soft ontology, a dynamically flexible and inherently spatial metadata approach for ill-defined domains. Our contribution is (1) the elaboration of the so far intuitive concept of soft ontology in a way that supports conceptualizing dynamically evolving domains. Further, our approach proposes (2) a whole new mode of interaction with information domains by means of recurring exploration of an information domain from multiple perspectives in search of more comprehensive understanding of it, i.e. multi-perspective exploration. We demonstrate this concept with an example of collaborative tagging in an educational context. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The popularity of collaborative tagging, otherwise known as "folksonomies", emanate from the flexibility they afford users in navigating large information spaces for resources, tags, or other users, unencumbered by a pre-defined navigational or conceptual hierarchy. Despite its advantages, social tagging also increases user overhead in search and navigation: users are free to apply any tag they wish to a resource, often resulting in a large number of tags that are redundant, ambiguous, or idiosyncratic. Data mining techniques such as clustering provide a means to overcome this problem by learning aggregate user models, and thus reducing noise. In this paper we propose a method to personalize search and navigation based on unsupervised hierarchical agglomerative tag clustering. Given a user profile, represented as a vector of tags, the learned tag clusters provide the nexus between the user and those resources that correspond more closely to the user's intent. We validate this assertion through extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm using data from a real collaborative tagging Web site. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A huge amount of data and metadata emerges from Web 2.0 applications which have transformed the Web to a mass social interaction and collaboration medium. Collaborative Tagging Systems is a typical, popular and promising Web 2.0 application and despite its adoption it faces some serious limitations that restrict their usability. These limitations (no structure on tags, tags validation, spamming and redundancy) are more evident in the case of multimedia content due to its challenging automatic annotation and retrieval requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for social data clustering which combines jointly semantic, social and content-based information. We propose an unsupervised model for efficient and scalable mining on multimedia social-related data, which leads to the extraction of rich and trustworthy semantics and the improvement of retrieval in a social tagging system. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={While collaborative tagging is attractive because of their easy and simple way to tag and search, tag based search suffers from no semantic descriptions for contents. Semantic web technologies provide a new way to annotating and retrieving images. We address the problems of both folksonomy and semantic web annotation systems for image retrieval in particular and argue that this can be improved by giving meanings to users' tags. This paper considers using both minimized domain-specific ontology and generic ontology. We show how less detailed ontologies can help end users to annotate and search with the simple user interface. Our prototype system has the capability to describe the semantics for contents of an image. Also, no previous extra work to create instances according to the ontology for later annotations is needed. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={As the number of Web 2.0 sites offering tagging facilities for the users' voluntary content annotation increases, so do the efforts to analyze social phenomena resulting from generated tagging and folksonomies. Most of these efforts provide different views for the understanding of various web activities. Results from various experimental research should be utilized to improve existing approaches underlying tagging data and contribute further to weaving the Web. However, in practice, there are not enough solutions taking advantage of these results. Even though we can mine social relations via tagging data, it proves no worth for users if this data cannot be reused. In this paper we propose a solution for tag data representation which allows data reuse across different tagging systems. To achieve this goal, we analyze current social tagging practices, existing folksonomy usage as well as Semantic Web approaches to data annotation and tagging. We survey and compare existing tag ontologies in an attempt to investigate mapping possibilities between different conceptual models. Finally, we present our method for federation among existing ontologies in order to generate re-usable, semantically-linked data that will underly tagging data. © 2008 IEEE.},

Annotations, such as those resulting from collaborative tagging, provide a new source of information which can be used to ease the process of authoring and updating domain ontologies. This paper presents an extension to the LOCO-Analyst tool, which leverages student folksonomies to support instructors when revising and updating course domain ontologies. The support is based on a computation of relatedness between ontology concepts and students tags which takes into account the "context" defined by the domain ontology. The computed scores are visualized in a tag cloud along with tag popularity scores, to allow instructors to easily comprehend the emergent feedback of their students. This approach allows for a simple and intuitive method for instructors to associate tags with concepts in their domain ontology. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={A distributed classification paradigm known as collaborative tagging has been widely adopted in new Web applications designed to manage and share online resources. Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital photographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text labels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging and introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging activity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform experiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a weighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show that this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among resources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely emergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number of users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in social tagging systems. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={As a representative Web 2.0 application, collaborative tagging has been widely adopted and inspires significant interest from academies. Roughly, two lines of research have been pursued: (a) studying the structure of tags, and (b) using tag to promote Web search. However, both of them remain preliminary. Research reported in this paper is aimed at addressing some of these research gaps. First, we apply complex network theory to analyze various structural properties of collaborative tagging activities to gain a detailed understanding of user tagging behavior and also try to capture the mechanism that can help explain such tagging behavior. Second, we conduct a preliminary computational study to utilize tagging information to help improve the quality of Web page recommendation. The results indicate that under the user-based recommendation framework, tags can be fruitfully exploited as they facilitate better user similarity calculation and help reduce sparsity related to past user-Web page interactions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we apply a statistical approach for discovering topic-specific bursts from a popular CTS - del.icio.us. This approach allows trend discovery from different components of the system such as users, tags, and resources. Based on the detected topic bursts, we perform a preliminary analysis of related burst formation patterns. Our findings indicate that users and resources contributing to the bursts can be classified into two categories: old and new, based on their past usage histories. This classification scheme leads to interesting empirical findings. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

abstract={Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the URLs being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact. © 2008 ACM.},

However, it is unclear whether the tag cloud is actually useful as an aid to finding information. We conducted an experiment, giving participants the option of using a tag cloud or a traditional search interface to answer various questions. We found that where the information-seeking task required specific information, participants preferred the search interface. Conversely, where the information-seeking task was more general, participants preferred the tag cloud. While the tag cloud is not without value, it is not sufficient as the sole means of navigation for a folksonomy-based dataset. © CILIP.},

abstract={Recently collaborative tagging has received great attention as a public effort to create and share annotations on the web pages. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on how this user added descriptions associated with web resources can be used to enhance the existing web search paradigm. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on data collected from delicio.us, one of the most popular collaborative tagging website. Some useful conclusions on the usage of different tags have been drawn from our data analysis.

abstract={Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to add data items and to attach their own metadata (i.e., tags) to stored data. The result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content and the metadata become harder to manage due to increased content diversity. Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of two collaborative tagging communities that target the management of scientific literature: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover the structure of the tagging communities we study. The properties of the structure we uncover suggest a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests. Finally, we offer preliminary results that suggest that the interest-based structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content retrieval and navigation as communities scale.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging offers an interesting framework for studying online activity as users, topics (tags), and resources (bookmarks) get associated with each other through a folksonomy. In this paper, we consider an activity-based perspective of collaborative tagging where activity is defined as the act of associating a tag with a bookmark by a user. The perspective categorizes activities based on two defined measures: intensity and spread, which indicate the level and range, respectively, of the tagging activity, measured for both users and tags. Our block-model perspective juxtaposes two sub perspectives: (i) A user perspective that captures the activity of users across different tags and, (ii) A tag perspective that captures the activity in tags across different users. This juxtaposition can provide an insight into different communities of users and tags. It has applications in identifying trends and types of interests in web communities as well as expertise, staffing needs and knowledge gaps in enterprise communities. Results obtained by analyzing data from a commercial tagging service offer interesting case studies.},

abstract={Recently, collaborative tagging has become popular in the web2.0 world. Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging has grown on the Internet as a new paradigm for web information discovering, filtering and retrieval. In the physical world, we use visual tags: labels readable by smartphones with cameras. While visual tags are usually related to a web site address, collaborative tagging, instead, provides updated, recommended information contributed and shared by users. In this paper we investigate the combination of collaborative tagging systems with visual tags. We present a prototype of a semiautomatic system generating visual tags which gather information from collaborative tagging. The user can interact with a list of relevant tags (built by clustering closely related tags) that can be further encoded in a visual tag, according to user's preferences. The user experience is enriched by retrieving multimedia content linked to the selected tags, present on the web. We finally show a case study illustrating our approach. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.},

abstract={The ontology development process is typically led by single or small groups of experts, with users mostly playing a passive role. Such an elitist approach in building ontologies hinders the primary purpose of large-scale knowledge sharing. Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a new web annotation method proving appealing features in fostering users to collaboratively organize information through their own metadata. Collaborative tagging shifts the creation of metadata for indexing web resources, from an individual professional activity to a collective endeavor, where every user is a potential contributor. In this paper we introduce an approach to knowledge evolution which aims to exploit the ability of collaborative tagging in fostering community members participation to move forward an initial knowledge structure. We present user scenarios about how subscribers of a scientific digital library might play the role of knowledge organizers through personal organization and sharing of citations of interest.},

abstract={The emergence of collaborative tagging systems with their underlying flat and uncontrolled resource organization paradigm has led to a large number of research activities focussing on a formal description and analysis of the resulting "folksonomies". An interesting outcome is that the characteristic qualities of these systems seem to be inverse to more traditional knowledge structuring approaches like taxonomies or ontologies: The latter provide rich and precise semantics, but suffer - amongst others - from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. An important step towards exploiting the possible synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy. This position paper presents preliminary results of ongoing work to induce hierarchical relationships among tags by analyzing the aggregated data of collaborative tagging systems as a basis for an ontology learning procedure.},

Thereafter, a focus group of teachers evaluated a sample of learning resources with metadata records containing both thesaurus terms and multilingual tags. The results of this early study suggest that some tags are found as useful as thesaurus terms and that users are divided about the benefits of multilingual tags. As some tags are useful for some users, "hiding all but the right tags" becomes crucial for the success of a multilingual collaborative tagging system.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign kyeword-so called "tags"-to resources. Tags are used for navigation finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we present two tag recommendation algorithms: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, an adaptation of the well-known PageRank algorithm that can cope with undirected triadic hyperedges. We evaluate and compare both algorithms on large-scale real life datasets and show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems are becoming very popular recently. Web users use freely-chosen tags to describe shared resources, resulting in a folksonomy. One problem offolksonomies is that tags which appear in the same form may carry multiple meanings and represent different concepts. As this kind of tags are ambiguous, the precisions in both description and retrieval of the shared resources are reduced. We attempt to develop effective methods to disambiguate tags by studying the tripartite structure of folksonomies. This paper describes the network analysis techniques that we employ to discover clusters of nodes in networks and the algorithm for tag disambiguation. Experiments show that the method is very effective in performing the task. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={While the Semantic Web requires a large amount of structured knowledge (triples) to allow machine reasoning, the acquisition of this knowledge still represents an open issue. Indeed, expressing expert knowledge in a given formalism is a tedious process. Less structured annotations such as tagging have, however, proved immensely popular, whilst existing unstructured or semi-structured collaborative knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have proven to be useful and scalable. Both processes are often regulated through social mechanisms such as wiki-like operations, recommendations, ratings, and collaborative games. To promote collaborative tagging as a means to acquire unstructured as well as structured knowledge we introduce the notion of Extreme Tagging, which describes systems which allow the tagging of resources, as well as of tags themselves and their relations. We provide a formal description of extreme tagging followed by examples and highlight the necessity of regulatory processes which can be applied to it. We also present a prototype implementation.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords-so called "tags"-to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare two recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank, We show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={When authors publish their interpretations of the ideas, opinions, claims or rebuttals in the literature, they are drawing on a repertoire of well understood moves, contributing to an extended discourse. Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

abstract={A large part of the modern web is characterized by usergenerated content categorized using collaborative tagging or folksonomy. It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community web sites. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including whether coherent categorization schemes can emerge from unsupervised tagging by users. This paper uses data from the social bookmarking site delicio. us to examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we examine whether the distribution of the frequency of use of tags for "popular" sites with a long history (many tags and many users) can be described by a power law distribution, often characteristic of what are considered complex systems. We produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to understand the basic dynamics behind tagging, including how a power law distribution of tags could arise. We empirically examine the tagging history of sites in order to determine how this distribution arises over time and to determine the patterns prior to a stable distribution. Lastly, by focusing on the high-frequency tags of a site where the distribution of tags is a stabilized power law, we show how tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags can be used to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags.},

This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Folksonomies have the potential to add much value to public library catalogues by enabling clients to: store, maintain, and organize items of interest in the catalogue using their own tags. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the tags that constitute folksonomies are structured. Tags were acquired over a thirty-day period from the daily tag logs of three folksonomy sites, Del.icio.us, Furl, and Technorati. The tags were evaluated against section 6 (choice and form of terms) of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) guidelines for the construction of controlled vocabularies. This evaluation revealed that the folksonomy tags correspond closely to the NISO guidelines that pertain to the types of concepts expressed by the tags, the predominance of single tags, the predominance of nouns, and the use of recognized spelling. Potential problem areas in the structure of the tags pertain to the inconsistent use of the singular and plural form of count nouns, and the incidence of ambiguous tags in the form of homographs and unqualified abbreviations or acronyms. Should library catalogues decide to incorporate folksonomies, they could provide clear guidelines to address these noted weaknesses, as well as links to external dictionaries and references sources such as Wikipedia to help clients disambiguate homographs and to determine if the full or abbreviated forms of tags would be preferable.

abstract={Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Finding good keywords to describe resources is an on-going problem. Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

abstract={The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

Also, we define concept of knowledge for individual agents. Later we use concepts of interaction and knowledge to give definition of a Link. Then, for a given Universal Set of Resources, we introduce Tag Cloud System (TCS) and definition of (possibly fuzzy) collections of resources. Finally, we introduce concept of Class, based on projection of collections of resources in the TCS, to lay down some of the groundwork towards TCS-based type system.},

Using frequency data and co-word analysis matrices analyzed by multi-dimensional scaling, the authors discovered that tagging practices to some extent work in ways that are continuous with conventional indexing. Small numbers of tags tend to emerge by unspoken consensus, and inconsistencies follow several predictable patterns that can easily be anticipated. However, the tags also indicated intriguing practices relating to time and task which suggest the presence of an extra dimension in classification and organization, a dimension which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

In current tagging systems resources as a whole are annotated with and referenced by user defined tags. For multimedia data, as e. g. for video data, single scenes can be identified and annotated by using MPEG-7 metadata. We propose a collaborative tagging system that is combined with an automated annotation system for synchronized multimedia presentations. MPEG-7 metadata are used for the annotation of single scenes with user compiled tagging information in combination with metadata provided directly by the author or by other annotation systems. Thus, we propose a system being able to search within multimedia data that can further be extended to search within any kind of (partial) document to achieve a more tightly focused and personalized search.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to provide an overview of the collaborative tagging phenomenon and explore some of the reasons for its emergence. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the related literature and discusses some of the problems associated with, and the potential of, collaborative tagging approaches for knowledge organisation and general resource discovery. A definition of controlled vocabularies is proposed and used to assess the efficacy of collaborative tagging. An exposition of the collaborative tagging model is provided and a review of the major contributions to the tagging literature is presented. Findings - There are numerous difficulties with collaborative tagging systems (e.g. low precision, lack of collocation, etc.) that originate from the absence of properties that characterise controlled vocabularies. However, such systems can not be dismissed. Librarians and information professionals have lessons to learn from the interactive and social aspects exemplified by collaborative tagging systems, as well as their success in engaging users with information management. The future co-existence of controlled vocabularies and collaborative tagging is predicted, with each appropriate for use within distinct information contexts: Formal and informal. Research limitations/implications - Librarians and information professional researchers should be playing a leading role in research aimed at assessing the efficacy of collaborative tagging in relation to information storage, organisation, and retrieval, and to influence the future development of collaborative tagging systems. Practical implications - The paper indicates clear areas where digital libraries and repositories could innovate in order to better engage users with information. Originality/value - At time of writing there were no literature reviews summarising the main contributions to the collaborative tagging research or debate. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has grown in popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs and other content. In this paper we analyze the structure of collaborative tagging systems as well as their dynamic aspects. Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given URL. We also present a dynamic model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge. © CILIP.},

abstract={We propose an approach that unifies browsing by tags and visual features for intuitive exploration of image databases. In contrast to traditional image retrieval approaches, we utilise tags provided by users on collaborative tagging sites, complemented by simple image analysis and classification. This allows us to find new relations between data elements. We introduce the concept of a navigation map, that describes links between users, tags, and data elements for the example of the collaborative tagging site Flickr. We show that introducing similarity search based on image features yields additional links on this map. These theoretical considerations are supported by examples provided by our system, using data and tags from real Flickr users. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={The Semantic Web mission is to enable a better organization of the Web content to improve the searching, navigation and integration of the available information. Although the Semantic Web is intended for machines, the process of creating and maintaining it is a social one: only people, for example, have necessary skills to create and maintain ontologies. While most existing ontologies are designed by single individuals or small groups of experts, actual ontology users are not involved in the development process. Such an individual approach in creating ontologies, lead to a weak community grounding. On the other hand, Social Software is becoming increasingly popular among web users, giving opportunities to exploit the potential of collaboration within a community. Tools like wikis and folksonomies allow users to easily create new content and share contributions over a social network. Social Software tools can go beyond their current limits, by exploiting the power provided by semantic technologies. Conversely, Semantic Web tools can benefit from the ability of Social Software in fostering collaboration among users, by lowering entry barriers. In this paper we propose a new approach for ontology evolution, considering collaborative tagging systems as an opportunity to complement classic approaches used in maintaining ontologies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={The social dynamics of individuals connected through the Internet is relevant to issues of productivity, viral marketing and the sorting out of useful ideas from the general chatter of a community. This talk will first describe a mechanism for automatically identifying communities of practice from email traffic within organizations as well as patterns in document access. Equally important is how information spreads within communities. This information has recently acquired a new dimension through the phenomenon of collaborative tagging, whereby many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content such as bookmarks, photographs and blogs. There are interesting patterns that emerge within these "folksonomies" Specifically; we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given url. A dynamical model of collaborative tagging predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge.},

abstract={Movements of school mackerel (Scomberomorus queenslandicus) and spotted mackerel (S. munroi) in Australian east-coast waters were determined by tag and recapture methods and were used to investigate the stock structure of each species. In all, 4427 school mackerel and 2106 spotted mackerel were tagged and released between 1985 and 1995 in a collaborative tagging exercise with the Australian National Sportfishing Association. School and spotted mackerel were recaptured at rates of 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. School mackerel moved small distances from their release sites (26 ± 55 km, mean ± s.d.; maximum distance, 270 km), with these restricted movements indicating the possible existence of a number of stocks. In contrast, spotted mackerel moved large distances from their release sites (202 ± 290 km; maximum distance, 1100 km). Temporal and spatial movement patterns of spotted mackerel were characteristic of fish from a single stock undertaking a seasonal migration. Commercial harvest information in combination with tagging effort reflected the different movements of school and spotted mackerel and strengthened the suggested stock structure of each species.},
