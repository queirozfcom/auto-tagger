  abstract        = {Social bookmarking is the process through which users share tags for online resources like blogs with others. Such collaborative tags provide valuable metadata for retrieval systems. While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

  abstract  = {Web 2.0 tools and environments have made tagging, the act of assigning keywords to on-line objects, a popular way to annotate shared resources. The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

  abstract  = {Content-based social tagging recommendation, which considers the relationship between the tags and the descriptions contained in resources, is proposed to remedy the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering. There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

However, as tags are freely chosen by users, the vocabularies are diverse, ambiguous and sometimes only meaningful to individuals. Tag recommenders may assist users during tagging process. Its objective is to suggest relevant tags to use as well as to help consolidating vocabulary in the systems. In this paper we discuss our approach for providing personalized tag recommendation by making use of existing domain ontology generated from folksonomy. Specifically we evaluated the approach in sparse situation. The evaluation shows that the proposed ontology-based method has improved the accuracy of tag recommendation in this situation.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a subclass-representation approach that predicts the probability of a social image belonging to one particular class. We explore the co-occurrence of user-contributed tags to find subclasses with a strong connection to the top level class. We then project each image onto the resulting subclass space, generating a subclass representation for the image. The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes. Our contribution is to demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive method for generating sub-class representations has the ability to improve classification results in the case of tag classes that are visually highly heterogenous. The approach is evaluated on a set of 1 million photos with 10 top-level classes, from the dataset released by the ACM Multimedia 2013 Yahoo! Large-scale Flickr-tag Image Classification Grand Challenge. Experiments show that the proposed system delivers sound performance for visually diverse classes compared with methods that directly model top classes.},
