When a boy finds a magic board game, which becomes a nightmare, he needs to finish it or the game will never end. 26 years later, while everyone thought he was dead, two kids again find the game and have to have the help of the boy to finish Jumanji. Alan Parris has been trapped in an ancient magical board game, Jumanji, for 26 years. When he is finally freed by two children, a herd of wild exotic animals have accidentally been released as well. Now, Alan must try to save his hometown from destruction. Twelve-year old Alan Parrish finds \"Jumanji\", a board game, in 1969. He and Sarah Whittle play it that night. When a quote says \"In the jungle you must wait, until the dice roll 5 or 8\" Alan is suddenly pulled into the game. Twenty-six years later, two more kids find this game. One of them rolls a 5 and Alan Parrish comes back. But he is soon forced to find Sarah and finish the game.
